P. R. dot org\nOr by calling one eight hundred seven four seven seven for for for\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.\nAt the ideas network\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball\nIn Nineteen Seventy five maybe ... yards and became the first female restaurant critic at the New York times\nAnd went on to reinvent the genre using disguises to get an honest meal also employing a smart literary style of writing today shares in his Ninety two years old and with no plans to retire she's currently a columnist of the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full podcast maybe how are you\nI'm very well very well\nI I don't want to rehash too many things everyone knows but ah in December Seventy five you became the food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the times is that\nCorrect or not quite the woman who wouldn't hire me was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire a name was Charlotte Curtis\nThe woman who did hire me was Joan Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper Abe Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those names [laughter]\nWell ... unfortunately for all of us you became a critic\nUh first of all it's a very artificial way of eating 'cause you go with the crowd everybody orders different foods you get to taste [noise]\nYou can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously has critic [laughter] is that something you eventually get used to and and get to like or is it always a burden that as you would prefer not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a shift experience\n[laughter] yeah well it sounds like me [laughter] so\nWe did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end where people\nOften do go with crowds uh was never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people and expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of press in ink about dressing up in disguises but you with us I think the first one to really do that I Love this quote a as you said even before the Internet I was recognized a few times\nThey are very few things more embarrassing than to show up in a way glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I I Would say so [laughter]\nYou didn't know what to do shit I flip off the way should I you know play it staying here or third and I had glasses and wigs I didn't I didn't ... outfits though\nNow let's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop you lie at cetera you're you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices and I think are not worth listening to particularly the ones from consumers like Yelp and so on are\nSo right I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but\nAnd I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI haven't gotten him in the past not for a long time just as on a mailing list or example many years ago\nThe questionnaires from the gap saying asking me to be a responder with all the things the frail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I've even ask Tim's the gap that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant or a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat the kind of rating from your local credit just to have a voice in there so\nI don't really care what those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean a social media you see all sorts of strange comments and their access to the ground all over so let's talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place you walk into a restaurant in the first Fifteen or thirty seconds\nWhat are some of the things that the you'll notice I won't either good or bad\n\nOh I might notice the number of help on the floor I might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and I'm moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people\nI might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super\nGreek diner in Chicago known is Lou Mitchell's and it's right near the Merck until exchange in the stock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life\nAt the breakfast and I went one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurants I went around eight thirty and I had to stand on line a little and does he does the owner or his managing gives out little boxes of I'm a\n... a candy what do they call it any way to to women\nStanding on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me\nAnd said where is your place and I said what place and he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\n[laughter] I really didn't for [laughter] it's like a Campbell or in a casino like you look around and milk\nThat is what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line and you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott\nOf cooked prone and a slice of orange in a little cup of yogurt no matter what you would if I imagine it's still the same but it was wonderfully observant of this man to notice my eyes working the room mark\nI I'm ... you'd like Joel rubber Shaw or in his cooking when you talk about his famous potatoes with a pound a buttered pounds of cooked puree potatoes but he had a great quote I'm a ...\nI made this recipe before but the problem with a recipe I think is that when you just put wind it would be in a pot it takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is hardly flavor was and the wind is enriching anxious it's kind of just to sit it can kind of nasty actually [laughter]\nSo I don't know how they used to doing Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen would we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of these really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic and no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to brace this late comes from the meat itself\nThere's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavors so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice\nAnd you're not ... tang bee before you put it in just you know the ... a little bit then put the median but you're not doing anything else for me before because there\nWere not that we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor assaulting me without actually having to do the work which you know we live around here so instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cut her off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there\nThat you would have gotten if they ... at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the ones the ones not in the winds waiting in the wings but it's going to come back\nTo the recipe at the end I Hope it does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning it really diluted not only the flavor of the ... the kind of made a meat tastes a little weird as well\nSo we waited until the very end to add that so we take the meat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strangely chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich socks so\nThis recipe the ... from peppers do almost no prep work cook a little use tomato paste the beat in three hours of the up and take it out reduced\nAnd it tastes great it tastes so good when thank you you can\nGet this tragedy for me I'm ... my ... street dot com\n\nOn ... and you're listening to milk street radio coming up next even uses it as a new way to think about pairing wine and food we'll be right back\nSupport for

Christopher Kimball right now ... and I will be taking a few more of your calls\nWelcome to the street who's on the line Hi Tammy Hi Bethany where are you calling from Houston, Texas nice how can we help you today\n[noise] first I'd like to say I'm a huge fan and I really appreciate all of that you and Chris expose this too and provide thank you I like to cook and I really um I read something new and I want to try you know these new global type recipes\nMy question for you is what some pantry staples that would bring in a more global fair that I could use regularly and like\nOh boy yeah we're we're going to have to pick and choose and you asked us to limit it and that's hard it's like well you want to start with spice blends first and then move on the show I think the spices the most people don't have\nSitar which is based on while time but it's got lots of stuff in it I think is the most versatile useful spice blend in the world outside sesame seeds and for Mac\nYeah ensue Mac would be another thing it's a Barry used to be used almost in place of lemon it's our but it's also lemony great on tomatoes you can use it on almost anything\nCoriander seed not ground coriander is something most people do have around I think is also really useful\nI'm going to put in a bed for a pet ... ... that's really great also because for vegetarians you know when you can add bacon or smoked salmon or some sort of pork products you can add smoked ... had to give it a little bit of smoking and you can buy\nIndia to have these little kittens which have smaller tens in them for spices ... herbs and you can buy one of those Saddam saw it and you can keep in that ten sort of the old purpose spices and spice one so for example at breakfast I'll take the ten out and put some sitar and some\nPepper or something on it and you can dress up eggs you can dress up anything next is pantry items\nLiterally a must yeah and me so she any by the way it goes gray with chocolate her risa yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example or is this and we're spread me so it was a great soup base white me so for chicken or as an isolated the fish when you're young yet\nAnd then my last suggestion would be pomegranate molasses which you can find almost everywhere it's our and it's sweet you can use it and I use it in a salad dressings just a little bit any kind of dressing or you can drizzle it over meet after its cook\nOr ice cream or ice cream anywhere you use a good quality ... can you see a pomegranate molasses I also want to throw in a vote for ... ... because they provide a smoking is Anna wonderful heat\nTo other simple things if you buy whole human seed if you get a pepper Grider putting coarse salt and then putting human seed\nSo instead of salt and pepper you're in rice salt in human yeah and that just for a general purpose way to improve your cooking you really can't beat that and then the last thing is I've really big crystal like sea salt or Florida seller molten salt\nJust to finish food over that crunch and you get a lot of mileage off that that's a good start yeah okay that is a great start and one less thing if you want to be a little exotic by or if a pepper you are FA you have to bite on line it's a soft damp pepper in sort of flakes\nAnd chocolate ... and rich is not too hot and it goes on a lot of dishes and just a few little tricks like that can make your cooking so much better so anyway that's ... [laughter] okay\nWe're finally done it got me what I was looking out for me to look at it like this is mostly\nA radio on Christopher Kimball if you have a cooking question are you just want us to help you resolve a calling every argument please give us a call at eight five five four to six Ninety four three the number once again as they five five four to six Ninety four three or email us questions at ... street radio dot com\nWalk in the ... street who's gone Hi my name is Kay thanks for taking my call today pleasure out can we help you might not get\nRange recently right now in Egypt type thing I got it bad for how much it would cost ... which can be about a hundred and Seventy five dollars [noise]\nSo I can now you're ... I never cooked on a gaffe strange but I generally hurt by professionals that knowing that extra cost I Would encourage have the luxury if it were well\nWhen we built up the street kitchens a couple of years ago for a variety of reasons we couldn't use all gas cook tops we had to use induction for many of them\nAnd I was not a fan of that but we did install induction it turns out induction\nWorks very well it heats up fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas\nBut once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job it's also safer because you're not going to buy yourself so I Know when ... Christmas you know an induction is yet and that it ...\nAnd the point is that it heats up the pan through magnetism through the metal\nIn the pan so that only the pan ... not really the burner and it really hates it efficiently and you can get it high and get it low very quickly and here's the thing about induction you'll save money in the long run because\nIt's the most energy efficient of all forms of heat and cooking 'cause the heat only goes into the pan gas is the least efficient cars that flames go out on the side that he goes out on the side it's not contained and electric is better than gas but induction hands down the bat so you'll probably save money and otherwise it's just the one thing I Would look out for us\nA bunch of these some of the controls you know used to be like in my day\nLike in a car you'd have a radio which had a station control and the volume yeah and I could figure it out with industrial controls that means like you have to hit the button three different buttons that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Madison", "day": "07"}
