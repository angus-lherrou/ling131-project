with one thing I Would work\nLands he tells the story of milk [noise]\nMark how are you I'm great how are you ah well I'm thrilled to talk to you um I read cod did was my first ... book a long time ago and your latest book milk I also found to be at least as interesting as cod\nSo let's start at the beginning I guess the ... people believe that the world started with a huge drop of milk\nYeah I mean a lot of cultures have creation myths that involved a meal and I guess it's not surprising because milk is associated with child birth so it's a beginning of life\nWell but but some of the examples are great in the north legend the huge frost ogre sustained by cow made from falling frost vicious new turn to see of milk to create the universe it it it was more don't don't try this at home\nI can turn a glass of milk like this has got a military um the thing you say is interesting is that what forty percent of Chinese today drink milk\nYeah which is interesting because that's actually the world average about forty percent of people in the world drink milk about sixty percent of the people in the world are lactose intolerant\nBut but the theory was and you explain that you need lactase to digest lactose in milk and the theory was Europeans do not have the gene that cuts off the production of lactase when you get older well everybody\nIs supposed to everybody who when they get to about two years old this enzyme lactase is supposed to ah\nStop working and then lactose become sins adjustable some people and that tends to be a Europeans middle Easterners subcontinent have a genetic mutation where this doesn't happen and that's why they can drink milk\nIt's interesting that this mutation that we have is presented as normal and the normal people are presented as having an illness [laughter] that's true actually lactose intolerance is this what we're supposed to be friends\nUm you said there was a just a shocking there was an Eighteen hundred it was a double in hospital that had a Ninety nine point six percent infant mortality rate\n[noise] yeah I mean what was called artificial feeding feeding children animal milk was not a widespread thing until the Eighteenth century and and the Eighteenth and Nineteen century it caused\nHuge infant mortality rates just lots of children especially in cities\nAnd given the odds I mean the New York city more than half of the people who died were under five years old and most of that was from milk so given that that was happening is an extraordinary that people still what I'm giving kids milk because of this belief that you have to give children milk\nThese eggs unless they're taken to at least one sixty but\nI think other than that you know you're fine you know just don't leave them out forever and the

ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball ... spent years driving around Appalachia in search of the regents history recipes and traditions ... recounts her journey exploring everything from Chile buns to a dozen different types\nOf local beings Renee how are you I'm well Chris how're you I'm good I'm ... let's talk about ... what is it an amalgam of a million different\nKinds of things if he were to describe it is there a way to describe it to make sense or it's just too diverse\n[noise] um the way to describe it makes sense says to accept that it's complicated and a moving target somewhat um and in that you can shape parameters around it but those parameters some time shift also on the territory that I looked at\nEnded at West Virginia\nAnd it goes down into the northern edge of South Carolina I'm In the mountains of north Georgia and Alabama and of course\nKentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina and if I left anybody out please don't hurt me so [laughter] um and so so even the geographic definition I can stretch and come together\nNow you you drove a van right is that right you drive and I have a van it's a Chevy ... guy [laughter] so how many miles how long you set out\nDo this trip is this a pilgrimage um\nHow long were you doing\n[noise] honestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally a journey into the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot\nOf what is written and has been written about um the people and the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are other experiences in Appalachia and I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we're at this model culture um\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated\nUm [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks rough got tired of 'em so they're they're actually the last census\nThere are more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American there there are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge um some of the assumptions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about on the Appalachian\nA perfect poised to talk about food so you are you say chili bond carried out from the Dixie pool wraps locally in red grief slick wax paper my favorite show now now now defend that so so these were really good ... or what\nOh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain\nA chili bond is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy\nChili mixture hamburger mix here that it was packed into a hotdog bond with onion and found mustard and the texture as extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe it's it's not kind of slurping around in the area it's in there being a\nFarm and the best way to think about this is this is this is a dish that was to my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat\nYou don't want something what Chile on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that and\nThat but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food you know this really through the ... sweet and savory banana pudding\nIt had powder jolt to the custard okay I can forgive you that but has red meat so red ... no no wait a minute now that's that's a that's a milk street your red meat so into a savory banana pudding what's going on\nAnd well we are being first of all true to the Appalachian palate one of my mother's favorite terms\nAbout taking a food of food that went from pretty good too oh yeah yeah buddy or she would say it had a ... to it and I and I think joined me Chris I'm campaigning to make that an official coronary term of wanting to it what does ... mean\nGrowing up in Vermont the locals had a team says the place one family named history to the road and the next week neighbors across the way to put up a sign Skidmore both for every hill and valley was named for reason minister hills wearing hills selfies quarters wrote in bear mountain\nAppalachian takes its name seriously to\nLogan giant greasy cuts shorter the names of Appalachian beams\nToday things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia name so real stories about real people and have them in some lucky people even get to calls\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen and treat the child was editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto ...\nJ Mario I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well gave her base was better than ours but you went to Italy to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nYou know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything rough\nFirst of all our ratios and greedy as are way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought and test of in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough ... they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist without\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course but the sticker world luxurious sauce we think we have to fit it beforehand that doesn't work I also learned that we get the order wrong\nAnd the order in which you add the ingredients are either motor pedestal or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the base for example in too soon you're gonna over process that are ... and that's going to give you the raw fish consistent\nSo your goal here is to get a pesto that's pretty dry is thought ...\nExactly it's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it touches the pasta but really if you lose then you've added to much olive oil and in general pessimism ... done until it's an added to pasta with some of the pasta water then it's considered pets are and then it's considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much olive oil we think supposed to be center at an earlier state\nSo what's the word or the ingredients okay the orders very important again because you don't want to order process the ingredients you start out with the garlic the pine nuts you salt and you're going to reduce that when I find hates that he's usually distributed through testify\nThen we add our cheeses you want them finally ground add those in and again you add those to the pile up in the garlic you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the cheeks now the bagel goes it but one of the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the ... and like they do in Italy\nReason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just pulse of the few times and it's done arcade most of the base where we find the grocery store tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier and we had trouble getting it to the right consistency without over processing it and turning it into a watery puree but\nThe solution actually was pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on the cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general what we use food processor to make this as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had in general\nWell get lax the romance of bashing it with a mortar intestinal but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the war that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious\nSo Jim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as the real thing thanks Jim Baker\nYou can get this recipe for pesto legitimacy one seven seven milk speak
