Desmond use a peanut butter controversy to change or food regulations and a lot of what the FDA does now and what it was doing back in the time of need peanut butter wars\nWas trying to figure out how many peanuts should there be an peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then where should the line be drawn and and that quickly becomes an existential question even if you think it's a really\nBefore we\nDive into peanut butter checking with reporters sheeley visited the bus station Toby to get great Filipino food\nI'm good how are you\nGood um what started in Tel Aviv on a Saturday afternoon Sabbath there is a very large bus station two and a half million square feet there we will start to story there\n[noise] okay so I'm Saturdays and Tel Aviv are pretty slow days most people including foreign workers have a day off today of rest public transportation shuts down a lot of the shops are closed people go to the beach\nAnd the bus station it's pretty much shut down except for the fourth floor which transforms into sort of a little manila\nThere's a food market and it comes alive with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Filipino workers I stepped in line and started talking to some of the women there\nOn Saturdays a man if he'd been is I mean here you know the\nMeeting their friends some day I think some ... they are setting here\nSo women Filipino caregivers who have their day off basically they got off work they go home and they'll either start cooking friday night or early Saturday morning and they show up at the bus station\nAround noon they'll bring these huge plastic Tupperware it's filled with warm noodles and stir Fry's vegetable dishes little plastic containers full of desserts um and they set up these tables\nIn the hallway of the bus station there's also produce markets so they sell produce that normally you don't get in Israel so cause solve our route lemon grass\nDifferent bitter chords that you don't normally see in an Israeli grocery store and we'll all be like stuffed up in the bus station and they can not only to eat and to have this and all your foods\nBut they also come to hang out with friends and see relatives and people who they knew from the Philippines to see how their work is going to try to work and life in Israel and life away from their families and the Philippines\nFor us federal ... it's how people like happiness for\nThe give us relief you know from one week\nDumped the daycare all people\nSo ... how did you come across the story in the first place how did you find a force for the busters\n[noise] so I was reporting based in Jerusalem and I spend a lot of time going back and forth from\nTel Aviv to Jerusalem and\nSaturday nights I Would notice that the bus station just sort of had a different vibe and so when I realize that there is a Filipino market there started spending more and more time there and what's so amazing to me is that\nThese women they live in a foreign country and\nBecause the chemistry so go back and use the original amounts and take it out when it's ... in the center if that works then you know you solve that problem now the question is how much should be you can take out it especially with the cranberries I Would think that could be a problem you might have to add an extra egg that's very delicate chemistry\nAll right well I Will certainly try that says thank you so much for your ... yeah well see what happens now ... thank you but I\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher ... if you have a cooking failure a complaint or if you just want

com\nWelcome to milk straight who's calling\nMy name is Ryan I live and Logan, Ohio\nHi Ryan what is your question today\nWell my question is a loss and next to ... a week or some of our own field corn last year wow yeah it was fun so we were trying to make at home and we did not have I guess it's\nHeckling Lyme we're trying to use what ashes and we weren't really able to find a lot of good information so I was wondering if\nYou guys and answers\nI go to Amazon and get the right stuff getting into your door that moral that's what I Would do I've heard about what actually being used the question is what kind of word is I mean what do they do within that yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nBut by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn you're growing for this right it's a ... like the kinds of field corn I mean it used to say\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety I Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the colonel's like a little bit more like popcorn but it's marketed as a Flint corn like something you know what ... or\n... or we've made cornbread with it and things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that would make it more difficult to make most of what the the kernels\nAbout ... on you know you can buy muscles [laughter] me [laughter] I mean you're you're let me just to understand that you're doing this because it's an either perfectly agree with you this is just a cool thing to want to try to do right\nRight yeah I think it was an episode of fear that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better if you have a fresh compared to like using Martha her you know like the stuff at the store That's Dr\nNo I I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn\nBoy by mixture pour it off get rid of the house boil it for four hours I think we just saw an ad that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the pre made here's a thought there's some wonderful our teeth no uh companies that make rats and ground corn financing mills is a it's an ...\nI wouldn't be surprised if you called the ban some males and asked them what is the proportion that they wouldn't tell you and then call good call one of the companies and just order a mosque [laughter]\nI think this is going to do one that would be my best

butter and Nineteen fifties many companies were doctoring their recipes with untested additives\nRoof does have been to Washington area homemaker decided to fight back and she changed the way food is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the peanut butter grandma\nChrissy area I'm great thank you so this all starts the late fifties people are manufacturing peanut butter that's not all ...\nYeah often in significant amount not peanuts ah at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out\nThere were in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is that the percentage that is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of the agreements were perfectly healthy wonderful things does it really matter well\nI think that is a big question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was a\nChris go there was actually in the ... the factory formula [laughter] at the just plant it was up to twenty percent Chris coat and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks\nDescribed it as if it wasn't a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream\nJobs are really doesn't ... it wasn't so great kinds of so the consumer reaction was fairly substantial 'cause you just tell us about it and how that happened and why did that happen and and how upset were people yeah well it all kind of\nComes down to this one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's ... daughter Janet swap her\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and a ... children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly an air this just peanut flavored cream\nRoof Desmond was a homemaker herself\nA very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nThis was a time in American history where food was really transforming and it was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant\nA and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice\nThat mentioned that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter and uh when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into\nThe jars of peanut butter that she was by and she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers and a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here's Janet again\nHe said I Will tell everything I Will get all the facts and I will ... to everybody because everyone needs to be an informed\nSo she called herself on alert or and that's what she got and that's what was in our news letter you know telling people all the hearings and what was going on and the bills in Congress she put it in her newsletter and\n[noise] no I Love about this is that here in America vegetables in games are kind of bland they weren't like the centerpiece all you have to do is look to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating a steak I mean it has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of NATO at the end I\nAdd those yellow split peas to the dish those are really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do and vicious restaurant they add a fried egg on the top to make it kind of a more complete meal but really this is so flavorful and feeling that you you don't really need the\nFight is going to go on everything about five years so y'all are supposed to be courteous some and course dish for Tuesday night thank you when You're welcome ... ...\nSe [noise] um\n... you're listening to milk street radio coming up

Hi Brendan how can we help you today\nI got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I try to ... you know 'cause that's where I needed to do with it really know what to do it either\nSearch Rikers swirling around here for a while and uh they kind of started letting off these real paper ... scares you were there and it could go from green color to burn it yeah\nThat's what I Do Chris you've done this now about ten years ago I went through this whole process because I Love coffee and er I bought a number of different roasters sort of the popcorn popper where the their air rated and they they go up in the air and swirl around\nI did the rotating drum roaster the more expensive one and here the problems first of all a lot of smoke so you have to do it underneath the hood of some ... ... New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans had a different roasting time and temperature\nAnd since very complicated to get a roast right 'cause otherwise some of the burn and some of them are green and he has this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans I could just buy at the local louder may play for like so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right\nHold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go to who gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not grounds beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way to go well\nUnless bringing you kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nUp on that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these green beans are good for the extra go crazy open to maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or somebody's\nGot to go on three or four hundred dollars and get around [laughter] and I gave up after a while and we found is second hand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place there's like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good teams and make great coffee and the other thing I find is I like lighter roast like medium roast getting the roast just write with these things is also a little tricky tricky\nSo anyway there you go to thank you so much okay Brendan thanks for calling ice recalling already took her this is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher ... please give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three\nEighty five five four to six nine eight for three or send us an email at questions of milk street radio dot com welcome to the street who's calling\nHi this is Han Casey how can we help you today okay so um you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one week and I think is with desert the one problem that I have let this happen to deal with the ... and I think the decoration presentation all of that\nI Try a lot of ... if you get home from my own thing and I ... but they never seem to work for the icing I tried that powder sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out right ... ...\nAnd then I tried to cream cheese one in the mix are also doesn't look\nWhat happened to the cream cheese when\nIt never really become credible like I always even though I keep it at room temperature I always feel like it clumps and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there though how can I make really good ... and I think at home\nI agree with you that the powdered sugar ice skating pretty ... yeah I really don't you can add like orange juice to some but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now I don't like him a chocolate processing always worst nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI'd like an Italian ringers whispering which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup like at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much\nAnd then you drizzle it on the egg whites has for beating them and the mixer for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another\nNo I was just going to say the Boyles frosting which is sort of similar involves egg white friend out what just sugar water egg whites ...\nBut the thing about the Italian see you added sugar served the egg whites there's also the Swiss where you heat up the sugar in egg whites in America to about one sixth day those are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for processing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I can kind of build up my confidence and start working with something a little bit more advanced\nI think the cream cheese frosting though that is going to give you a good texture and that's going to hold really well to\nOkay and I wonder if maybe that's more a technique issue with me and not maybe really knowing how to work with my next or you have a hand mix\nAn actor and what happened you said it was just the tests you was to stiffer it's like the cream cheese Cal State kind of clunky uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
