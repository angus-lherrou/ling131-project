I wasn't used to being around really young children and I\nCertainly hadn't been around any that were misbehaving [laughter] and I didn't know what to do and I was about twenty six years old and I I had to learn the ... message tonight try to [noise]\nTo trust him and you know the projects and he just\nWouldn't stop and I ... when he heard another child scrap disarm I [noise] I didn't find them hard [laughter] but I have is a shame that I did that and um\nI thought that I was I was being let go from the school because of that incident but in fact it was instead because I was wearing a rather miss cake last [laughter] see three plows [laughter]\nAnd then you went on to other things so let's talk about your parents you said um it was a wonderful thing you wrote about your mother before she died you said speaking to you you live the life I wanted to live so ... what what does that mean\nWell she was a communist [laughter]\nJay Maria I'm doing great it's pasta being day here in milk straight is less a call ... or as a lot of people say ... but look this recipes in hundreds of times I've done it many times you've done it but you went to Italy to see if there was something new or something that we don't\nKnow yeah you know it is such a simple dish and I guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have an amazing amount of flavor and and our max that they bring to the table and it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy winery that used to be owned by the mafia\nApparently the government took it away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors around in the meantime of course of course because it's the ...\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was willing to teach me basic rustic civilian cooking and this was one of the dishes she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the rich are romas a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she had done is frozen ... into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor in some wild ... that she grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cooked them away and\nWhen the deans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was a ... good for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile\nThere were layers of richness and ... and yet there was no dairy and so why is this different than the eighty nine versions now all been through I think the problem with most version is that the focus is on the basics\nHere the beings are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich federal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married in this kind of like starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd said the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple group of ingredients it just has an amazing impact in flight so I use\nThe alterations so that we did we made a couple of first of all we simplified it for week Nike's we use can beings and we were very happy with the results because in part the can't be have that structure water you need to get the creamy sauce that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found was a little heavy and we wanted to lighten it up with that and I'd even the dish a second time elsewhere is asleep and that time the woman making it added some tomatoes which we live so we borrowed that to kind of bring a little bit of a city to it\nAnd finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also help tie everything together is right and also really played well with\nRosemary supposed to call functional like I say I'm you know a basic recipe but now authentic

I've got nothing left to say but what percentage of sugar is the corn syrup\nUsually a five to seven percent of the powdered sugar staying with a shortening are fat I'm shooting for around ... under a sign that seemed to help but after heating and cooling maybe that's causing the constellation or\nYou know the other things I can think of is like the doughnuts being too hot or the glazed ... when it goes on to the donut\nWhat do you do that you take the doughnuts out in glaze 'em right away or you let them cool a little usually\nLet them call like up to an hour or so before I get to them and then the glaze I'm trying to get as close to just warm as possible\nIn the industry when you research before you open the shop did they say to glaze the doughnuts that there are certain temperature to\nCool is what I've been reading and scenes from other industry folks I must say Reshef by trade so this is sort of new to me the whole construction side of things\nI Would think that if they cooled than you might have a more stable adherence between the clays in the doughnut 'cause if it's grueling ... steam coming off I don't know yeah I I Would try perfectly cool doughnuts and see if that helps\nYou know let me just turned ... um you know and I glazed doughnut just at home you know with a simple glaze of powdered sugar melts in LA [noise]\nUsually I've been advised to let them call very slightly and to put the liaison Raleigh warm you know maybe try and very cold because you've got a heated glaze the glaze I Do is not heated more try him right when they you know like four minutes five minutes out of the oven\nHave you found that it depends on the humidity of the day or the temperature outside or\nIs it ... absolutely\nSo can I come to your shop and get a discount on the ones with the ... so it may be made my guy well no maybe Sticky Fingers scout yeah moment Dickey finger maybe that's a I didn't turn it into marketing\nPlus yeah that's not a bad idea [laughter]\nNo I Would try different temperatures and I would play with a percentage of corn syrup just double it and see if that makes a difference\nI haven't done anything that higher yeah we just doubled and see if that solves the problem is that would be an easy fix absolutely\nI Want a donut yeah Jay you did a good job they're hungry and good luck with accents\nI Love the show and it it's great to talk to you guys and yet\nThey care about I\nWelcome to milk street who's on the line I this is this level it how can we help you\nUh so I guess about a year ago I read the uh Giuliani wrote that seminal book on Indian cooking\nHer description of how to capitalize on ya and [noise] and it's different than the way I learned how to care minds onions which is to sweat the onion almost as soon as they get out of hand with salt\nSunny doesn't mention that putting in Salt until like very at\nAnd ever since then I've tried it both ways and I have\nNot been able to the cameras on the incense\nYou mean that whole thing ... to say your onions don't care much any more\nI got ... I don't know oh dear\nI think we just cycling [laughter] maybe [laughter] this is psychological problems I'm outraged [laughter] ah Chris what do you go I just\nDid it last night I ... I did a low and slow and a Dutch oven salted at the beginning started them every seven or eight minutes was fine let me ask you how are you doing it let's start with that\nWell I guess I keep it on a medium high\nNo salt\nDo you want to keep it on low low and slow in some places they just fly onions you know you put them in a skill or with a bunch of oil\nIs it flowing slow mean French onion soup is a study in ... you know a bunch of onions for forty five minutes ... white wine you keep doing that four or five times and then you get a dark rich soup [noise] same concept but it's always low and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Madison", "day": "28"}
