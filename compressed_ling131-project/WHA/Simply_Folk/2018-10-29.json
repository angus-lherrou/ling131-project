I had a twelve ... the knock and to me\nShe could see the car she could see the streets you could see that the everybody it was so amazing and it was so she was getting out she was hooked every single day she was on looking at some other place some other fabulous I don't know tourist attraction all\nOver the world\nOne day she was in Tokyo she had been there for about an hour looking all around at\nThe differences between Japan and the United states and she is just the writing on the the signs that she could actually see she couldn't read them that she could see them and then she saw\nBoy he was dressed in a school uniform a ... a backpack slung over his shoulder something that you know kids here don't wear and then a little further on there was a woman smartly dressed woman she had\nA bag that was gray with a purple shoulder strap over her shoulder and this hand was trailing it looked like along the wall\nNow Amy couldn't see her face because and Google Maps all of the faces are blurred and blocked out but she knew if she could have seen that woman's day she would have been smiling just to be outside walking\nAny side and closed the computer and went to bed [noise]\nThe next morning she got up in the first thing she said was that she was going to go to visit Paris she'd always wanted to visit Paris but it was never realistic realistically ever going to happen [noise]\nSo she opened Google Maps and in she went and zoom down into the heart to Paris to some of the tourist attractions along the street she saw amazing sites people walking\nWindow shopping she saw signs that she couldn't read it was really such an amazing feeling to be there almost\nAnd then something caught her eye\nRed sneakers\nShe swung the camera around\nThere was a woman who was sitting on a bench waiting for the bus and she had on red sneakers\nAmy wore red sneakers\nShe pushed back in a wheelchair and look down at her own feet and then looked at the picture and\nThey were the same but you know what\nThere are a lot of people that were red sneakers she looked at the woman black pants white shirt her face was blurred and\nShe had\nWith a purple shoulder strap\nWait a minute Saudi Amy is is that the same woman that I saw when\nI was looking at Tokyo no way out\nShe knew that they couldn't have been taken at the same time no one can be in the same place at the same time uh besides which these were images stored\nOn the computer and without being able to see the faces no\nNot possible she went back out and the next place she went German\nBerlin and one of the things that she had wanted to see was a recent article about a monument that had been built because the wall in Berlin had come down and she wanted to see it\nSo she finally found it zoomed in and it was almost as so she could read the words on this monument she could see the people looking at this monument she could\n\nRead sneakers there was that woman she was on the edge of the picture walking away from the crowd her head turn to look back at the camera\nRed sneakers black pants white shirt and that bag the gray bad with the purple strap\nA me felt the hairs on her arms stand up her skin trickled and she thought well\nDoes this cannot possibly have\nNo\nMaybe Google Maps as doing like a where's Waldo or something maybe that put it and so she looked on the Internet to see if that was possible but\nNobody had reported a thing so that\nShe texted her friend who had showed her Google Maps and said look at these three places and tell me can you see this woman\nShe waited\nAn hour later he wrote back and he he said yeah\nBut only in Berlin\nYou okay Amy texted back yeah yeah all good and as soon as she hung up the phone she went back to Paris to where she had been before the woman was still there\nBut she wasn't sitting down on the bench anymore she was standing up\nFacing the camera\nWith a blurred face\nAmy quickly pulled back\nAnd shoot back into Tokyo and the woman was not walking her hands across the wall but rather than Dover petting dog she quickly some doubt and sat back and thought\nImpossible\nHow can this be happening\nShe felt perspiration break out on her face if she thought\nOkay I I gotta I gotta look at something else and so she filmed in to London and quickly went from street to street to street looking at each window looking at each intersection looking between the cars nothing nuts\n\nAnd there she was the red sneakers boarding a double decker bus\nHolding the gray bag with the purple strapped and clearly looking back over her shoulder at the camera\nAnd now Amy was really freaked out her stomach flipped and she wondered how this could possibly be\nEspecially zoomed right out and decided I'm going to see any place any place in this world she closed her eyes zoomed in ended up in Costa Rica on a beach in Costa Rica in a place that Google Maps could not really has ever gone\nOn this speech\nThis woman the red sneakers the black pants the white shirt the gray bag\nShe was the only woman they're the only person on the beach Amy slam down on the computer and thought oh no no\nI've got to do something about this I mean who do you call in a case like this\nIn every foreign countries that\nOh God\nWhat if it isn't just foreign countries [noise]\nShe didn't want to but she lifted the lit up the the laptop and reached with her hands shaking perspiring she cuts back on Google Maps and then she typed in\nThe ZIP Code of her own city it's villain\nDown onto the city center and she carefully scanned the computer camera one way and the other this way that way nothing proceeding down the block nothing nothing nothing and as she near the park there was something really odd\nIt looked as though\nAll the children and the parents were fleeing were running from something\nOne more click down\nAnd there she was the red sneakers the black pants the white shirt the bag\nBut this time she had one hand inside the bag pulling something out and our other hand was pointed directly at the camera and Amy she filmed out\nPushback thought about calling the police thought that maybe she should call her friend\nWasn't sure exactly what she could do she could hardly think straight she was panting she was so afraid while she was thinking about what the best thing was to do she heard a car outside and suddenly thought\n\nWhat if she's here\n\nShe typed in her own address of the ... of the apartment complex zoomed in\nAnd it was just as she had seen it before people frozen cars in the same place\nThe door half open half closed everybody exactly where they were supposed to be she was able to see on Google Maps around the corner of the building and she's slowly methodically looked between every parked car and when she was certain\nThat there was no one\n... ...\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd I love the no the one who maybe they know hold them and that's\n\nOn my\n... dum\nDum la da na na\nNa na\nNa\nGave him ...\n...\n...\n\n...
