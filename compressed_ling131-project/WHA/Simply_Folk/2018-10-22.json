I you know listen to some wonderful music on the cover a lot of ground just wear socks from a personal to the political which you know your typical your career what what has been the reaction little song ... at the shows you're\nA well when I first started doing I Will stay on the audience reaction really what\nI Try to think oh yeah the linear fashion interrupted\nSo many people who are looking for a musical articulation of chili but you know the highlight of that for the summer or winter spring to me was something special which was the story of may going up and Dorsey Marilyn\nI'm a surprise cable on Christmas Day actually has triggered a holiday album that'll be a mid November\nAh called something special recollection twelve to ... and I've really had a great\nDeal of fun when they get together because I Am I'm a holiday is that we're all familiar with 'em and touches all these personal Lola teach well ...\n\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm\nChristmas thing all the president's son ... to ...\nMom's taken him in that gene with us and we we threw him on\nMom was in ... in\nYou got an autograph bat and the catch is man he's happy as a big role in in some special ... hoping\nMaybe they\nOr as to whether that's in Colorado and I keep calling me on spoke center ... headline\nThe toilet strings on the wall now\nOne\nUh bring a\nMusic from a\n\n\nThere are moments in our life when I think we turn to the arch to express the antics preferable to a really touch\nOn the inner core of our feeling a about ... the circumstances and as you suggested yet which is a time that is fraught where this trust among many branches of uh\nOur our day to day uh have tended to ... ... you know I I talked to a lot of people who don't read the news now in the morning or because it is so depressing but they'll turn on the radio and listen to Pandora ... music that\nYou know brings us all together and that's what folk music has always been tempted to do in a very community sense a you know it reaches the heart of all the\nWell I think one of the I think you're right about that sense of how folk music gathers together I think one of the challenges with any genre but folk music too and I think it maybe it's been one of the historic knocks on and has been well if you've got a message it doesn't matter how good the music is but I think\nThat when when you talk about and I think what Peter Paul Mary you as a source of done is as the importance of making sure it's quality music too but this is something good to listen to him that um it does have a message behind it so they kind of bringing the two together\nWell it is true that we spend an inordinate amount of time when we were a trail arguing over fine detail and I'm sure that that showed up in people's appreciation you know sometimes\nIt was the line of a song that was two on the nose you know we felt that that uh it was an overstatement uh sometimes that was not hurting enough\nBut many instances we would just step out and who writes something but keep it in the genre for instance ... books there but for fortune which is that\nYou know very well known and almost traditional to now had no bridge or that is to say no musical rich but Peter Marian I felt that they are we really needed to make some statement about world hunger and\nAnd I mean we never bought it credit for it\nYou know financially or even on the ... we recorded we did what did what they said it's awkward but\nWe have to take a piece of music it might be well no I Do but to make it at the same as you pointed to keep the quality of the original watch the\nShow me the\nMe the Cheney\nAnd then being a\nAre buying\nWas showing me out of the\nShow me the train the\nMe those are\nShow and\nNah me read one\nBought last march ...\nNa\nNa na na\nNa na na\nNa\n\nMe the cotton carrying a\nAnd ball\nNames\nNa\nNa na\n\n\n[noise]\nWhen we when we started out the conversation you mentioned um [noise]\nI'm married passing in two thousand nine in the audience sort of Mary at the concerts and I wanted to ask you\n... sort of asking the obvious I suppose but you know what was that like for you in in Peter to start performing as a duo instead of as a trio was I'm sure that was challenging in many different ways as it is that they continue to be that way or\nUm [noise] well there's an empty nuts I mean there's gonna be a certainly initially\nA kind of a a shock you know and then now wearing is that a very important part of your life is missing it gets very similar to you know losing your mate in a in a relationship but\nThe the I think the big surprise was and I tried to indicate that we spoke earlier is that the audience really steps up to the plate I mean they are so there and so supportive and then so much in a sense\nFeeling the all lost in the same constructive way that Peter and I do that it becomes a kind of a celebration he you know kind of a\nUm a joyous remembrance a and the ... dedication if you will to those principles that or you know expressed in this amazing thing called folk music\nYeah we've talked a lot of this conversation about music and and and social activism but I Know spirituality has also been a big part of\nYour life in your career and it's a lot has been an intersection of music and social activism and spiritual what is it what is it the ties those three aspects together for you\nYoung ... the\nThe little\nThat yo\nThe truth oh\n\nKnow\nNot\n\nHe's a Cassidy let's wait and the water will be back with just a few more songs you this evening on temporary folk\n\nSupport for
