I'm a business person\nSecond to last ... plus one plus one not pitching lawn cutting that idea very passionate about it I can see I can taste it I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look

she's brushing my teeth which is drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter] oh\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you know it's supplemental on me so I guess yeah you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just feel it [noise]\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can't sometimes you get a track and I like can you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular with director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging and ours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky just be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to\nHer I just had to come up with an idea and like heart for the best you know I didn't quite nail at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success rate show\nBut maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... out of it can potentially be more competitive out that because there's a lot of directors out there\nIs the biggest skill to you if you're fishing for me on the energy\nLarger scale I mean yeah I had the opportunity to working of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm looking at the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then again this not genes look beyond\nYou are listening to the conversation gets up to a rude awakening music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you burn operating at a level where many of the office he worked with huge big names and know exactly what the ones I\nCan think can be specific examples where you've had to navigate accommodating ... holding on to create a vision and I knew him and you say that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points with somebody when something a little bit differently so it just it does yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way 'cause I mean I have to put myself being a woman in the industry and competing with of course drops going to lead because it is a male dominated field and that ... the editor cross all starting off\nOn television so I was a funny person that now when it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity\nTo knock it out the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony at I was one of the house\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what to do it is not like you know I'm the director now and it's like yeah look I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that and I mean I'm not just one one thing they had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be as visual as possible\nAnd I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show and he called me like I was like actually love this treatment and bite off you are like that in the I caught one\nAnd I need to make a decision about what you're going to say that you know what how about you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better job because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that Charles eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't heritage that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten long boosted tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business cards universe and a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because it just the the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much are charging [laughter]\nI'm very expensive very kinds you never know how they ... you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging ... I'm ... ... their partners like I'll give you figure that projects do that I Do for nothing at all but\nThat would have made me the most money when they came to me my budget or the little bit too much for them I really loved the project I Want to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in that particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people have seen that and gone I needed to work in this project right sort of them were\nI guess the next thing is going to be given to them you can get\n... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much you owe challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because it does a rule of thumb that older to get ten percent of the budget\nIs and what would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of a budget\nSupport for WPRI comes from United Way of Dane County through some a credit union United Way as dedicated to fighting for the education financial stability and health of everyone in Dane County United Way Dane County dot org\nYou would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because\nA matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nWhen you see that that didn't make The Tempest and what does that mean ten percent of the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label\nCan get in your experience how a male and female artist treated differently by their record labels\nWell in my experience and is obviously general conversation doesn't apply to everybody of white way but it really depends on the artists and like how much they already have to bring to the table but if it's somebody who is to\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

and ... and the crush of a line air plane carrying more than a hundred and eighty people playing disappeared into the sea shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital Jakarta and a search and rescue effort is now under way up and speaking to our correspondent cherish my ...\nThe last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out long\nAh which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat are the search and rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board\nBut at this point they still haven't found any survive as they've also sent helicopters to ...\nHe has to look for any people and charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials and Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash well it's kind of\nWhat they do say that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recording of obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crash some thirty to forty meat is into\nThe sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I have to add them and what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the water it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now those reports that you were talking about the pilot had\nAsked to turn around soon enough to take off\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea what do we know about line air and there are safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago to the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy\nSafety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of a lion air flight which crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however an aviation analyst have also said to me that\n... as a congressman she doing Thirty years she wasn't within the elite of the president parliament he was someone they always held\nStrong views sometimes controversial view and he had his a group of loyal voters that or only enough to elect him congressmen\nAnd doing Thirty years he remained like this\nTo the point that when we had\nThis car wash up ... basically swept away ... great parts of the political establishment she was one of the most vocal voice against the workers' party that was untouched by corruption\nGiving him an edge and this aura of someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both an hour or it was a vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in ... the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the ... the cue community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these common some concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were appalling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where do I believe that the president institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that's hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strengths of their president legislative and judiciary system [noise]\nNow those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single really wanted that our economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nHe gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose a little kid just to be his ministry of finance public as as an economist that is very respected in Brazil and have someone who has very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring this trends and also twin boys the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that Brazil was a parliamentary system disguised as presidential new system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the key decisions or they go through the parliament to so the key aspect to observe his relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition base\nDo the indicators that these relationship gives will give us a ... six months\nUh if his relationship starts to tremble all little bits and show some lack of communication and they must be concerned about the ability of the government to deliver\nCan't go the other gal at their Brazil analysts on that big win at four giant both ... the country's new president but also big challenges ahead [noise]\n\nOver the past couple of years as being what feels like endless bad news about plastic pollution with pictures of slugging beaches and trucking animals going around the world\nNow some two hundred and fifty organizations including businesses accounting for twenty percent of plastic packaging ... assigned a commitment to get rid of the so called one use plastic in the next seven years that's plastic the huge one time and then just go rattles\nNow one country that has a very real interest in this case the Seychelles which relies on his blue season Christine beauty the tourists donors\nBut which is struggling with growing mountains of plastic someplace at home much of it by those tourists and some which flights over the sea from other countries I start to Vincent maritime vice presidents at the Seychelles who's at the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we generally think Seventy two thousand tons of waste and upsetting but then don't this is plastic waste so you appreciate the manager of the problem we consume plastic but we did not produce\nAny and yet we have such a large amount of plastic we also received a large amount of the stick as marine debris\nLending on a show is coming from other countries\nAnd other regions that is affecting a pristine beaches\nAnd also and they own a coat refund this is unacceptable for the health\nAnd the cleanliness ... reefs and beaches in line with us to stick it image\nI look at one recent report from the state news agency sign that said vote on ... picked up one point two tons of debris on the beaches are just one island or some ... island um is this the social thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on for their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists away but they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number and Jews and myriad of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S out very much part of it they are aware and conscious of the need for us to protect to\nA beach or all sees a Walter from ... so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nA to support what the government is doing to read a country of the of the things that we know ourselves for just about that lend up on our beaches\nSo there's measure there's just been announced to get rid of the single use plastic or a plastic container say they're trying to use one since ... recycled how much difference do you think that will make to you whether it\nWill make a um a lot of a difference because we we fight we bear the brunt and only if we have a twenty percent on those president ... joined up I think it's a beginning a\nNew beginning because there's still the cheapest sent as you say who haven't I mean it's a very small steps to well it sounds like a massive problem\nEvery judge it begins with a very small steps we have done exactly that and we have a twin and the partners like minded by those who haven't joined us and I think the effects are far reaching beyond the twin\nDeepest and to have a who have joined in and I think there is a lot for us to\nFrom those we are sure that others will join in because we all appreciate that plastics is affecting that have a planet we'll appreciate the fact that he does not only profit that shoot\nBut also how we protect the health of our planet which is the only one that we have as mentioned marathon vice president of the Seychelles trying to give it a global perspective but if you look on line you can

World Service Brazilian economist Gabrielle elicit they was talking about where the free market reforms could work in Brazil there is a cool a precedent for this in Latin America and warm that Paolo judges will be familiar with\nOkay with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies and other times Chicago's economics department was well known as a sense of for free markets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman\nAnd it was in the Nineteen seventies that a group of Chilean economists later dubbed the Chicago Boys because they do say studied under Friedman sets about making radical free market reforms to chilies economy under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with dramatic consequences\nOr find out more about what happened from total of ... as a journalist and film producer in Santiago in Chile she recently made a documentary called Chicago boy's\nEyes were very young when they went to the U.S

this as a window to get into power and to apply these extreme ADS being supported by the military guns\nWhat what were these extreme economic ideas what kinds of things were they doing\nSorts of long days they thought that the state was mostly on usable that the power of the economy should be in their private hands there is one phrase that they said when things belong to everyone\nThey don't belong to any one day we a distrust this tape so they wanted to have that small state as possible so what are they successful they were very successful um they came to power which Pinochet more or
