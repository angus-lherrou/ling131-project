its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for

provided by the end is F a I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election

I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns to own and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor success it's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process why on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right towards stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell well the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite that threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in a in a democratic process and let the African people\nChoose handler my we have to end of that

being stopped in their cars and\nI'm with a peace day lot fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go to any restriction without having to show documents with the idea that you might go back to there being any sort of state presence or a military presence or anything like that along the border of deep concern to people\nPeople took the risk of violence returning if there is a will to we established between the Irish republican all of the night and it's a real threat\nI think that it is you know when people talk about a return to the troubles I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think a lot of a hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups so gifted and Republicans on what our most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said is\nThat if there was any sort of border infrastructure people and those people that are car and I did that work would become a target\nThan it's the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here how serious concerns about ... a new data hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view\nAll that people in ... and not into it would actually like to see the ball to come back well\nEverybody says you know the political parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion is all say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that north and on and can be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that the northern I wouldn't be excluded from not\nWhereas the majority of the party's view the boxed off as sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and they said to me you know we've

it's ... that has done\nHi up onto the agenda or maybe it hadn't pain in the past the PCs had sort of felt the constitutional position whereas NIH with ... said people here are talking up Irish unity and away The Waltons on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting that union is feeding the practice it will strength and northern Ireland's union with Britain\nWhereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually of identified as one of the British union aside if things are nice starting to soften up to the ideas so it's a very interesting set of circumstances\nI certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every TV show every talk show every pulling all of these questions new one to one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel like\nThe idea of Irish unity\nIn the middle of this big storm and everybody's looking at us\nNot least because we're going to be the border between you and the u._k. but also in the context of the D. U. P. propping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where their views have to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that they've never had to do before\nThat was freelance journalist Amanda focused on talking to my colleague ... ... you're listening to business daily and today we're exploring the issue that could and Britain's Brexit negotiations the Irish border\nHistory of division explains why the ... has become such a sticking point for the Brexit negotiations that's being old to a parent in the British Parliament this week\nWet pro breakfast and piece from the British prime minister his own party have been threatening to try and ... that has been talk of a political assassination of foot with Theresa May ... anonymous sources have cold the killings on\nShe survived so far but the border issue remains so how might it be resolved if indeed it ever as I'm joined by all UK politics correspondent Rob Watson now it's been a tough week for Teresa maybe you could see it on ... how she felt\nThis way to you're absolutely right you could say that most weeks and I think there's a long level she has some good some bad days and some suffer incredibly ... relationship with her I can only describe ... divided conservative policy\nBut I think what doesn't change is the big picture which really does look round the grim and challenging for her and that is how long enough to she got to do about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe\nThat somehow satisfies yes that fee brawl divided conservative policy which doesn't want any businesses and then you see much which doesn't put ... on and and and and if that was enough\nWhich satisfies the you twenty seven\nSo Rob you've laid out a complex set of conditions that needs to be felt that all the different policies that needs to be satisfied but I actually the parameters of that is a fairly clear on because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to see has meant\nThe you're absolutely right I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible fix that but we are in that if you like\nThere's a contradiction in the ... projects and ... you is prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to strip it back to basics just send them if you\nIf you think about what the what was what was leave all the ... it was taking back like quote control of bulldoze all ... ... ... a well it's quite tricky to figure out how you do that and have friction let's trade with the European Union and not have a bold in Northern Ireland\nUnless of course the European Union was to say guess what you can actually have a spoke to you kind of something special we will recognize\nHot equivalent ... and that is why we are in the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about a thing as you none of the things that we didn't like and he was saying was she gotta be kidding\nSo what we're seeing is the ... middle of a negotiation but how much should they should brinkmanship how much that is both sides kind of holding out for the best deal they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within their positions that the two policy\nI think some of it as brinkmanship a dozen things that you felt like compromising much cause that things falling on a minute you know the people who voted to leave but she'll mess\nYou clear it up and clearly Theresa May hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions\nAnd our policy so I guess what's going to happen as if I had so rarely if someone put a gun to my head was to say that that will be maybe they'll scrape together at the one that\nPuts off all those issues that we've been talking about just the fact that he will the future relationship be won't will happen with trade what will happen precisely how about the ... so they sort of settle on making sure that there is in chaos next march march of next year when Britain leaves the European Union\nBut all those issues who's going to compromise how is the future relationship gonna what\nThat that'll get sort of kicked tens that transition period between next march and the end of twenty twenty\nBut listen if I Can't agree again if they're struggling to agree just on the divorce agreement just on this withdrawal agreement\nThen how is it that they'll come to a final sacrament they'll come to the the we get enough compromise between the two parties to come to a settlement that there'll be able to actually ah find some kind of a deal for ...\nIt's a fantastic question and of course it's it's one in a way\nWhen when he was good at Fort drives ... people are already in ... crazy they think hang on a minute this these talks transition could go on forever and ever but it also all those people who would have preferred to remain in the European Union who think this this just looks like a recipe for kind of\nChaos and disaster Britain's sold in the European Union but so some notes in it so now the prospects of a long long process pleases neither remain as an all leave us\nOkay let's just go back to the issue that these programs about the Irish border that's struggling to a great for the withdrawal agreement for this divorce agreement how are they going to come to a sacrament in ... in the longest I bought my assessment of the border look like who's likely to compromise look\nIt's an immensely difficult question just and of course some really smart people have been looking at it for two years and of course\nYou know that the reason there's nowhere in the world whether it's not a bold and one of the two countries and the customs union so in a way that you and the u._k. are trying to do the impossible I suspect\nThe compromise and the ... will only be able to show some will be that the whole of the you have to stay in customs union until a future relationship is walks out with Maine\nNo native will be such a close trading relationship that would be no need for a bold Ross absolutely no sign\nThat was Rob Watson the BBC's Westminster
