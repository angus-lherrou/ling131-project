time that doesn't get burned out breaking the conflict area a and they're the security situation is is very tense but that\nThat the other issue is not there is a lot of community mistrust a small but significant pockets as\nA community of people who are resisting 'em\n... who are quite skeptical of the of the virus in their response and making the health why is that that was very difficult is that the mammoth\nYes because we heard about these um the red cross volunteers who are trying to swiftly removed borders being attacked\nAbsolutely uh you know there's there's it's quite common to have a community mistrust and then they voted on break it's very scary virus a wet people there's a lot of people dying to oversee people that are very scared but I think you know the specificity with this outbreak is that it's happening happening in an area\nWhere there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension or in in the community\nYou know just last week Eighteen people last month sorry ... people were killed in an attack by ... group on in Benny\nI on the city as well and so people are very uh very SCAD didn't angry and there's been a lot of ...\nActually in venue at the moment I against rising insecurity and not the result of that it's making the response is very difficult and I'm I I'm being told that every day I didn't them and ... genes how teams have to stop for a few hours either because it shoots hang\nAround the city oh because it's protest and this is hampering that their response or the tracing his contacts with people who could get rest\nI it's it's making vaccination I still practice and ... and making the burials a burials more logistical than that is really a key\nPositive response ah because at the guy that virus that is that is very contagious I ... on on someone who has\nDied and to the burials is ready I keep mounted their response and this is why they've instilled the new security measures wet and he's at school it's all they double a full burial teams if needed\nLouis divest our correspondents in the capital of the deal say can chess I thank you for making time for us on the program this morning Jonathan ... is with me in the studio here in London Jonathan un noting particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how we usually this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nAn of causes a lot of a local culture an an an local uh practices that involve quite close contact with a dead body and so\nIn past outbreaks we've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial took a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that if you can't get access to the communities\nAnd of course the other elements as well as as a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected\nYou isolate them and then you monitor the concepts of those people and if any of them becoming infected you isolate them and by just doing this isolation ... contacts monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control but of course you can't do that if it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nAnd the coolest wet actually there is distrust all modern medicine absolutely\nAn this huge mistrust and and again we ... we had from Louis that there's a very effective vaccine which really well in the in the twenty fifth outbreak in guinea which is really what it was a given its first opportunity\nA and this is a very effective vaccine in these sorts of outbreak conditions but again you needs to be able to get into the communities you need to have than willing to be vaccinated so this is an incredibly challenging time\nThe world Health Organization is saying it may be another three or four months before this latest outbreak is brought under control just how bad could things get in that timeframe\nBut the worry is that there are cases which is a cropping up in very disparate parts of the the region so so at the moment the outbreak comes around two hundred square kilometers and I'm not saying the whole of the areas go about her infections but there are a little so sigh of outbreaks\nAnd of course if you then spread your resources over great geographical area it becomes incredibly challenging trying to do something about so whether it's two months three months or even longer who knows at the moment\nThis question one last one is the this is a disease which so far has been largely can find to places like that the ... the the worry is always said it's going to somehow get on a plane and then be spread around the world how big a risk is that briefly so\nThere's there is a a risk that it can\nSaw in the twin cities you know break but it is unlikely to spreads too much unless those places haven't got great health infrastructure\nJonathan we'll come back to you during the course of the program as soon as we can from the b._b._c. world subsidize five forty five\nGMT the release of the latest un report on climate change on Monday focused attention on some key aspects of our daily lifestyles for example are you prepared to give up driving\nOn to walk cycle or take public transportation steady prepared to cut your consumption of meat and dairy products these are some of the steps recommended by the inter governmental panel on climate change and its report on how well can keep\nThe expected rise in global temperatures down to ... to one point five degrees Celsius of a pre industrialization\nLevels CI PCC says the wet way off track on not targeting we're heading towards the rise of three degrees Celsius it says we need to make unprecedented changes to the way we live our lives and dramatically reduce\nOur use of coal and such changes will inevitably cost trillions of dollars between now and the twenty thirty five so is there any if this\nRealistic to discuss this we brought together a hell of a ... a former prime minister of New Zealand to the former head of the United nations development program and detach hell I'm professor of energy policy at new college ...\nIs one of those moments of truth I mean if you look what's happening globally we are ... miles from the project Paul ... the I PCC recommend and we're a long way from the kind of measures they how they mind so we have a in China nearly one thousand gigawatts of cold now ...\nThat building two hundred and fifty new power stations in China and this voting two hundred coal plants outside China as part of that development programmers and they're growing at about six to seven percent prime which means China will be as they called me twice its current size\nWithin a space in about ten twelve years [noise] southern India China and Africa old growing six seven percent or we'd go coal maintaining its role in the international stage and we've got the oil companies projecting the old mom will go on up\nI think it's going to be very very tough because it colds full unprecedented action by countries and we're not seeing unprecedented action at this point\nReally we're going to need the most incredible political will and heavy lifting to get the policy setting some place\nTo change what at the moment is not looking at one point five ... two degrees future but something much much worse with with catastrophic implications when I was prime minister I was aware of\nPolling evidence that said do you think the government should do something about climate change to nearly everybody says yes yes they should and then when you say well you prepared to pay more for your pet trophy to do something about well nowhere near as many people think like they should do that said it requires very bold leadership\nI think it's to the ... seat to pull out this kind of science based report about what has to be a little bit careful about how it's done so one of the great illusions that those who like myself I Want to do a great deal about climate change\nI've been guilty of propagating is telling the public that you know you can have the greatest transformation from my almost overwhelmingly fossil fuel based world economy\nToo warm that's based on renewables et cetera within the space of the few to ... do you know well it isn't going to cost you anything in fact it's gonna be economic growth denouncing\nNow I don't think any practical votes or believes that and all the evidence is is a housing clock correctly said when the ...\nBeen told that he wasn't going to cost much they tend to react negatively and ended up ... world how you get the population of China to persuade the Chinese leadership not alone in\nThe Republican support base in America the trains Mr Trump's mind body is really quite a bit off the truth is China is a coal Paul why we got to experience very significant climate change unless we can find a white sweating the Chinese leadership do otherwise\nAnd I think we should also heed the words of next to the way he says you are the pine now to make the transition or you get a pie immensely more light to that for the adaptation to the catastrophe of what we really need this transformational leaders who are prepared to tell the public that they can't go almost lay off in\nOne respect I'm extremely optimistic the pessimism is about these ... down kind of global agreements the optimism comes from the transformation the technologies if you want to think ... around the ... century for serious optimism\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by

yet other changes in diet of people that might make them on healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on on our trajectory what we protected might be an underestimate actually\nLast spring been from the opposite Martin program on the future of food renewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put see eye to into the atmosphere I don't think granting sauce making a call ... of well generational ready and living with\nClimate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs this just slightly dancing the benefits of wind farms or what you know it's all together\nI don't think it wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution in packs\nAnd given the very long time scale of seem to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density is a winter brand race basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested some very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts ... kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number it's more like half\nA watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWell less important because I Know that you were very interested in solar power and I believe that the ... ... square meat or you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more what's per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you have environmental and social impacts\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and that a big importer of our finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than a land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and he's climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new thoughts on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this time going on at deep Keith climate there's a link to his papers by his blog site to via our Web page at BBC will serve is still call them\nThat like most scientists

definitely and also there's no small company you know like you said if there's a ... they also they probably has a ... they are a big commercial ...\nComplained is the American Chemical Society or the membership of academic chemists and research chemist that's\nRight yeah so ... is a big for profit company but you know the American Chemical Society does have subscription generals it requires researchers to pay to access content which is essentially it's the business model\nOn the other side of this is this organization called research gate\nYeah research get is essentially an academic social networking site allows academics to share their scientific papers online basically that's the purpose of it but most of the complaints and\nThe complaint is against the article sharing practices of research case so what else have a and the American Chemical Society are alleging is that research Kate is not strong enough in his policies in allowing pay will continue to be uploaded so

insects maintain that balance when apple and my colleague immediate ... ... more from the leader Sacha ... yoga\nMichael on this study was to understand how flies are able to maintain power while flying I mean one thing we already knew about flies was that they have these specialized ... called how peers and I'll tears are basically to fly equivalent of your inner ear of the stipulation so they use them for balance\nAnd five can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the healthcare trust lie and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control culture the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was Seventeen fourteen I think about what we didn't know how the whole chairs actually work though what information where the whole chairs providing to the fly so in order to figure that\nOut what I did was to record from the ... and I found that the timing\nOf single spike was different when I recorded the hulk here near in a position that stimulated straight flight versus when I recorded while the health care was in a position that an elite\nAt a flight rotating so basically my data showed that five can tell the difference between stable and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of the spikes coming from their health cheering her on\nBut it's also about what they're targeting as well no because they have that ability to kind of over at the same time but they're also quite quick than of getting away\nSo the ... century Oregon they're more reflective there and the cannot sensations of that sort of how you feel as opposed to Asian and the reason they use these are there more reflective behavior just because it's much faster than fish until it's kind of like they can uh\nAnd correct it really quickly what's important about the funding\nSo important for us because this research has shown away and that complex aspect of an animal environment can be broken down to the timing of single spike\nSo this is how our brains initially record that information in the world trade single spikes anything on there on every experience you've ever had it can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons and find you know different just seem to be here to study fly because they had a lot fewer on than a human mind\nWhat will it mean for for humans this information\nThan human neurons work exactly the same way\nSo it certainly helps to understand how different organism sensory systems work in order to understand our own but there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example or be flight technology\nWise it had millions of years to evolve fascination mechanisms for why so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same technique to build our own bio inspired technologies\nI've hundred yoga and now before we puzzles here at the news room ... mind
