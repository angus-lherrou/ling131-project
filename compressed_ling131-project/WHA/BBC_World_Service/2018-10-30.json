Americans are voting early often record turnout in some states as hard for the midterms as it is for a presidential race so far almost Eighteen million Americans have voted early what might that tell us about the results I'm Joshua Johnson the voting explosion across America next time on one day from W.\nCountry is in serious trouble so I think that's why so many people are out and talking about politics which may be years ago they didn't they are doing it now if\nThe Democrats win the house are going to just talk about your whole mission shop what's what's going on [noise] raise taxes and things for\nSince you out on a task to predict the outcome of lack of elections\nPosters and professor Chris for X political science class are busy trying to protect the outcome of the race it's not just the national political environment helping Democrats here that shifts and demographics as well voter registration is way up a new Democrats outnumber Republicans four to one\nNew registrations are usually younger voters are and they tend to to break Democrat but in this particular cycle that's accentuated I Am so Democrats if these new voters do turn out and there are some signs that they're going to be more likely to turn out really does give a boost to the Democrats in a district like this is reaching out to voters from sue them while campaign\nAnd the final days of his campaign will come down to which candidate get their message out back and which party can turn out\nVote there I'm a volunteer which isn't wild campaign and we're just not that\nWith us and the other topic reporting unless you heard another report the economy healthcare to the key issues for Republicans and Democrats a head of the voting next week\nWell went to the polls say about the issues the uppermost in voters' minds I've been speaking to leave Marron Gulf director of the Marist College poll on the company ... an independent polling and election consultant first cafe\nWhat issues does she think will help voters make up their minds\nBut I find the most fascinating thing is that the polls which suggested that we have two completely different electorate so Republican electorate which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic\nElectorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care\nThat means that it's an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs on the outrage in Pittsburgh the mountain what difference might they make you think\nI I think there's a tone and the closing days of the campaign\nThat can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week where people moved into Donald Trump's direction\nI think right now this is a kind of issues that ... to talk about in partisan terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the final week or a big midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd he has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nWell I think it's interesting because there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes\nFor key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say well you know he's got some odd characters are things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nWho are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you're stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI can say if I may there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading\nThe party and reading those people who who voted for him two years ago on if I also can add something about\n... we've had shootings in the United states and we've had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly shorter\nThis coming ten days before the election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncovering what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women and the things he says about women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects opinion\nAnd what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ\nWhen it came to opinion about Supreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerge and be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of back critical group of voters and the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates\nThat leaves these independent voters and especially independent women and independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably just a group of voters that to zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party I'm much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton nights really losing the influence how do you see badly\nI you know [laughter] I think there were a couple of primaries that sort of ... some headlines I'm not sure that we have\nAnything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point other than there's a lot of mobilization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats have necessarily pick sides as to which part of them\nIs going to dominate the process I think they're a unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point ...\nIf the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short also from each of you or how likely use it for the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate late\nWell I think you know the ... and I suspect cats will agree with you I mean the conventional wisdom maybe rights as one giant ... how it's like to go democratic in the centers like is the Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of the Democrats but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives the Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate\nJust because there are too many\nVulnerable red state Democrats were on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who as I see that the that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse those old is just as all these Democrats or state for Trump Card\nLabor and golf director of the Marist College poll on the company in front of it
