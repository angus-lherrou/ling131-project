of politics the University of Kent nine or ... a novelist and journalist\nYes among lecture on government at Harvard University in Cambridge being bother Gopal electorate in English at Cambridge University welcome to you all I'd like to begin ... each of you will seize identity politics what do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think to ... that has been given and is used to describe\nClaims for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with him because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have less to do with identity of a sudden than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that's a little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized identity individuals and small groups\nThat's how I ... for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing everything makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us to get citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in mass its response individualized and but I think it's an individualized response rot them more communal collective response yes among\nMe into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems\nFrom mixing goes up so I'm Wondering what we're seeing at the moment is a lot of a minority groups claiming equality came in riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups has ... elements of the state line of try to [noise]\nI think the term ... around the ideas that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I regarded as anti individual from around part\nOr I think the problem is that you have on the one hand by techno classic can lead spinning abstract things that resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of my knowledge the majority was bumps his shoes off and I think one of his very ...\nWhether you up like a wise or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any ... any sexuality whatsoever that real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBy the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always a paintings of what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be X Y or Z that\nThat doesn't seem if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about ... writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some you know recognize that but that's exactly in fact walk the other team movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what ... and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white American goal and sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which the movie which tells the mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting us has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden the invest debate the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was possible left but some of food that was problematic size leave for me\nIs the crux of a disagreement about what society one because I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation those on your picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably about ... identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up\nI find some of the discussions off\nWhy can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy a wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left on my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different\nFrom the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation and we have to address the fact\nOf political oppression\nAnd structures which disenfranchised people before we can all things from the same him sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after we coached on politics until it kind of button all Hollywood wrong call light all I Would\nFor you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ... well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian\nAnd all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an artery social level not necessarily\nBoards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us and be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe\nYou're going to think twice about approaching them and not ugly or I didn't get life fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word you might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Adrian\nIt's intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on all pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the difference is defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out and that should be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out she's that's how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she reminds you of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus in this shouldn't be warm\nBut at the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think that politics has become\nSo do you live on strike I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't bringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that would get and it was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo let me give you a couple of examples of first what I Want to make the uh but I think a lot last night in many ways is an important movement and wind but has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem with police violence in the United states\nAnd I think that as one of them in fact I've met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's white people who got shot by the police as well\nI Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough people have never lived in ... religious monolingual states this is what I'm saying you situation that we find ourselves in why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's just because my guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society simply not on the function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing up on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people fail\nThis was a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center then Tuesday it's by definition exclusive\n... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a lot\nAllergy is an amplifier\n... well it started to disagree with the premise I Do think about the search for you all democracies in the world with founded on a ... ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and find God who started the challenge that we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that if something has talked quite new ...\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upset around inequality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by is minority than black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called\nIdentity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering okay\nPlans to think about that thank you for ... panel\nGrandfather Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't kettle UK or tweet me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll to cost up\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against us sanctions quote and and who reached to tell them that somehow that I didn't see much less than half of all there's not as much as I said I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe are able to be most depressed people in the early ... an in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the right approach and engulfed in a rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe all people who are involved each we have people who embedded in relationships institutions lessons feelings do methane disabled belonging and if I'm going to place to people to communities and countries might just be kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease positive reasons for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense of on the longing that she ... the identity that was that before whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact\nThat's a boring observation in northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interest not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door a bull in some ways it was if you'll\nNever end the remote the in India and you ah preach ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India\nWins bodes well one of the problems is that\nCountry the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and where we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps sorry I'm confused I\nThought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice lots to the tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the\nLarger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes\nAre okay I mean I'm very bad I don't know I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who have close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious last minute crews and the question is how do we deal with this in ... the society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me for the best response\nIs to try and domesticated behalf wild feast of national news and to try and claim is ... to make that inclusive to save at ease the higher a collective\nUh it is a level of the kingdom of looking at it states uh but obviously we fight full inclusion of all different groups under that combination ...\nHow do you make that journey from being a cosmopolitan a member of the metropolitan a neat to being if you like a flag waving patriots\nI'm ... I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and lots of people have your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nAnd that's how bad the anxiety saying that you love about it how do you enjoy it isn't ... what's wrong and loving your country and its people at the end zone accused all the people of identity politics but I'm saying that your national zoom of your post nationalism I imagine you are and your your your\nUm your your national ... thing making my country but the question in my ex enough majority in some of\nThe majority of them so I look at nationalism\nThat's something that had served it stop us and the anti colonial struggle but today has become a very deeply dangerous beast what is the right response would be the team to end up for\nIt is or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians respective me that he is not true and it's not as\nThough the older a form of nationalism the Congress party didn't have an ... elements to it the one hand out to Asia various other angry as well as looked at what age it if if I can bring it back then in a sense there there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between\nFigure identity group saying that\nA national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets well 'cause I think the problem is\nSometimes you need something more overarching can build a bridge you know we can be work because we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester but also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan also spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European\nBritish or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible but that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here\nAnd the answer is that if everybody identifies primarily with the national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu Muslim I'm black and brown\nThen we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level\nWhich coincides with the actual ... cents doesn't everybody carry multiply and it was the of course on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself\nThe ones that have foisted the of course they do and the people like ... like a mountain dew for king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of\nPeople who have my identity is to emphasize oh common interest ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of the whole and under the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above that level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a ...\nThat's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British nationalism that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on a painting by a sub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down\nThere's a clear correlation between what you would call ... national as I did and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again I don't think we can have the ranks that ended in ...\nWhile I mean it it actually quite a lot of people ... did vote for breakfast I I personally am not expecting that run the George ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

lost to come actually even before the trade war\nTensions really talk but around the middle of the of the year we already saw signs that the Chinese economy was slowing and what's my father and those those indicators are still in place that that growth or in the economy activity and the economy will continue to slow down into\nNext year before the stimulus the uh the the authorities are currently
