genocide\nYou have to you have to reach\nOut beyond your own group whether it be women or whether it be African Americans you know to build a winning coalition\nYou're going to go national and you've got to obviously you include man and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicity so how do you go about building booze coalition that cooperation\nWell so I I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just than just that yeah as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing\nIn my writing the whole point\nOf intersection analogy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are\nA state of values and objective um there are many applications of intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms and discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas ah\nOver in as against the uh claims that were made by Anita Hill I'm the what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and Semitism found in the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge meant that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination was largely set forward by African American women plaintiffs\nWho are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into ...\nBut but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners\nHave looked at the history of looked as you say the failure of the times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black sisters I'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says\nI find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist road it's time to ... back into survival mode\nDue to the dumpster fire him live by a black feminist agenda and\nI mean ... ...\nPeople who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and and I find this very interesting um\nFolks who are concerned about too much group miss um respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals um who think differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who\nUm is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of a white women it's not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact\nI'm only forty eight percent of white women actually believe doctors lazy Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap in American society now than a gender gap\nThat doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I know this guy is a problem\nI I get I get the into sick now the argument that you can bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to orders are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be with us on a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments new powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pull into groups\nOr many of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was\nA multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences I think in fact\nUh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the president they feel about Morocco bummer 'cause he's with the midterms coming up his reruns of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and they'll GDP Americans not as a little known since I said I had ... votes from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually Washington rather killing off he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nUm I had took issue with him for example ah on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor\nI'm sort of a difference a within a broader reality\nThat we are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania um\nIt's true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American\n... and just to final thought on that as we go into elections that were in election season than the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the poultry liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale whites\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that\nAgain in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and I'm I'm group based politics it is a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I I'll I'll make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that game the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator who was the first a Democrat\nOr to the elected from Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women as the whales and the best but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class because black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political global mobilize\nA coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this and there are little action will see\nWe will

very Internet that is generated so much economic growth and the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily\nPanic about ... someone else's harvesting that data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nThat they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely\nAnyone so what is the ... it was this architectural weakness well you're\nSeeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web protocols back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period\nYou have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants to\nWear a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential\nAs Ken Berger as Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have it\nThe most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that face\nOpting out is is is now kind of gently being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happen to them that are bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further

information warfare fake news\nAnderson is the founder of scout AI it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the both of them and ... the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially if Twitter data and the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots\nYou know I did a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally ...\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or to visit comments on line is that there's a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and heart in ... by their beliefs are that it in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary that um you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing in a in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent of which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world kind of like living in the Truman Show [laughter]\nIt is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I just people presumably understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator without having that conversation on telling people these things but regular folk don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other or at least they think\nWell yeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or thoughts or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat then they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them the way that you create news story\nCreating a trending topic and so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and the normal people get involved and it picks up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on much trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id by a group of fake accounts\nOn social media as you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out there and take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it hasn't yet happened not yet Barry ... who suggests the variety of on says to fix these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like blow up trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc decentralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized attack it's no different than it is essential and\nBut it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did the interview over here
