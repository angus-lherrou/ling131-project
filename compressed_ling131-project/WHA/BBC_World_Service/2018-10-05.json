buried and we want to uncover it\nThe truth is going to come out I Believe that there are still some people\nAlive that has something to do with what happened on adrift all night and so it's important to me because it's going to still allow the truth to come out allow some closure and most importantly to me it's going to honor our ancestors is going to honor those people\nWho who lost their lives are in a most horrific horrific way\n[noise] a difficult difficult parts of that city's history an investigation into exactly what happened finally is going to happen according to the mayor it was

or tools\nTaken away at a time when they'd rather spend those last moments with their family members and so I I think all of those are already dynamics that are in play to create trust and um\nI I think to add to that I think particularly in the are the are looking at an environment where there has been active conflict for a long period of time so you're asking\nPeople to come into care to to become stationary um and and to give up that amount of trust you know to to outsiders\nWage which since I've got to be hard to begin\nWith interesting though because I I could understand that maybe in twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you said there was the outbreak and in places like Sierra Leone throw your own and people were still trying to come to terms with the fact that the kennel properly say goodbye to a loved one who's died they can't touch them they can't bury them\nBut the DR see for example that had many Ebola outbreaks in in the past ... ... you would expect that it's become part of the general knowledge that\nYou know the ... by now people know that it's so dangerous that you shouldn't be in contact with with the body of someone who's died of a bull\nI I think that those are two very different community and you don't know if the people who are involved currently had that knowledge permeates through those communities right I mean if the knowledge is there it's not so much potentially a knowledge issue as much as there is a trust issue\nI mean think about climate change ... him and it's the same thing like you have so many people have the science and may not believe that it's the same thing here where they may have been told it but it in the end it it comes to building long term bridges to those communities and and having those already in place before a crisis like this happens\nAnd I think um that's why you're sort of seeing that district and not and and I think these are communities like I said that has\nBeen affected by conflict for a long period of time that may not have that trust at based on how do you prepare there was a health worker I'm up to to care for the patients or to go into this area for the patients to go back to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash it\nI Can't even imagine I can tell you just without in in the early on when I was taking care of patients it was hard to begin with because you're providing care in this very strenuous situation that takes a lot of physiological reserve\nBut it also alters the kind of care that you can provide you know it alters the relationship you can develop with the patient because you're in these guards you know these personal protective equipment\nAnd then to add to all of that I think you're also acting in a in a in an environment where you're worried for your own safety and I think patients can sense that rate and and and we do our best to make that connection and so all of those things combined in in addition to sort of um\nHaving going into a community that you you have not care for the past this is why national healthcare workers training national healthcare workers and making them available and making giving them the resources is probably the best strategy in the future because\nThey have that connection against in connection community and that's why the artsy had been successful I mean you can see the prior outbreak the one that happened in lake which are like they were so successful in controlling this\nBecause of those existing network and religions have bigger outbreak that requires more outside forces\nNow head thank

I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and named reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the bar and see today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate guessing missions can come and says well\nI think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut it does not oil we're talking about oh yeah but\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants read for example gas or even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the verdict greener\nRe first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I'd have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the vibrancy because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the old sinuses that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah county or and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next fenced in and out came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to the international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt will thing that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of a student at when I talk to them today I'm told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get a false I feel ...\nI Would look at the time frame because at least but says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty one\nBe from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big\nBig job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge job ... on on how well you know when it gets hot you just mentioned also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you like to know is smoked and we'd be debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut he's also important to understand that the speed of that renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built how fast new investments are being made into when you pull energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with Fidel as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow ... does anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become said I've been working environmentalists just for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment then\nIt's become ... but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about something down the protection that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince the kinda\nWe have to look on what are our options left all the renewables for example\nWhere are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get to ... do so well uh you get to perhaps if you're a lucky from a organic waste and it's part of this circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making food\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called a cleaner now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more ... gay or\nAt the same time we have to address CCS than Susie you because carbon capture and storage on carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like ... regions they stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold and it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere is a lot of things we have to do and we can do because we are in the situation we are kind of you wants to come back and says yes it's definitely\nIn Norway ... effort political party actually agree on is what we need cash or sorry it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away underground or under the ... yes we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use on the government they no way are shifting government so it's been quite all of a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and his staff has been focused on an All right for Twenty years I think you also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying that solution is more oil and gas I don't think women know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you pleased to let her know what you think of the program or if you have any idea of the topics ... the real story at BBC dull casual UK and you can subscribe to the ... such a BBC the real story pulled coughed up\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S was made possible by American public media producer a distributor of award winning public radio in Concord eight PM American public media with support from the three R O T

Public radio is going beyond the ballot asking Wisconsin nights what's important to them and we're meeting them where they are out in the community are you going to vote\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with that we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign Sutton area sudden specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because for a ... nation and I was so\nVery cause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he wanted to be part of really creating in the future and I think the future and it just securities of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about some of my two developments in which the Arctic to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of them are in Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you have or an engineer in in terms so I think you would father started renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can't government's fault\nNo no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to a hundred degree and shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expansion and the American sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to I don't think I think you've made up yeah I Know but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got the Gulf them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that ... and the ... now and the energy sector\nConcentrates at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of ... of it is a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see and now that when you have ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective than fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by\nProducing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is Jody grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia\nGave does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there's an elegy terminal which taking natural gas it's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian got an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the bar and seek comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than older ... older to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that Norwegian energies plane as some people might not some reasons of buying it but it will say that it means that the way as a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the parents said they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and

comes to two guests and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exploding guests to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but this is about what kind of view do we have for Europe past twenty fifty and Europe's committed

I deeply felt during my eating sorter but I was like oh it just it's just because like my head hurts or my stomach hurts because these are the things that most people express their discomfort and like that's the language that we use\nStaff told me that even the what used to describe eating disorders themselves didn't fail right\nThe Chinese translation of anorexia it's actually teaching food disorder\nI think it's just very misleading the way that\nUm it's name in my particular case um I I Love food with like my whole entire heart like food is life and so my eating disorder um developed largely because I thought that if I could control myself in front of the things that I I really loved and\nUm I used to eat with like know that you know then I could control my entire life\nStuff

China do patients and their families and friends recognize that they have a ... enough to people realize what these illnesses are\n... they have the TV and that you\nShould or should I say they want us to level is not very consistent that is some patients families might realized very early on but they're not as it might take more than ten years to realize there is a problem and before they ... they could have been treating it as a ... logical organic logical disease\nThe feeling of shame is very strong so many people are not willing to face it I'm currently there's not enough attention to it in schools who pretend to see when a person becomes kicked and\nHow much do you think that western ... contributes to the problem and eating disorders in China she's on that\nShould sound out insurance from western culture is certainly going great but I think it also has a little to do with the rapid development of China's economy nowadays there's food everywhere and China is a country of ...\nSo impatient hospitalized it is easy to get better but once they get out of hospitals they have faced with all kinds of food temptations\nThat are currently notes extremely slim Chinese and South Korean singers and movie stars on young people want to be like them it's hard to say whether this is west and influence but I think China's new found openness is definitely an important contributing factor\nAnother crucial factor is the over protective ... of Chinese families when it comes to their children so when the children stop to excessively squander food all money and then voted to tone

start a family the expectation of marriage and children directly fools on the go\nSo girls may feel heavy button and there was a view that goes who suffer from eating disorders of trying to take
