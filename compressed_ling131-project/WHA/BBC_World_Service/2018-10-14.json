[noise] I've heard different um whatever mental above my partner and just they told me to love and you haven't seen them since ... when I was five years old how did you lose contact\nI was born in a war country like uh last time my daughter was killed and my mom was well\nYou have a brother yeah and you at that age making off to him and he was two years old\nOf goes you as a baby on the most important was finding food nothing else we will have to survive if we don't have\nTo see the future we'll have to survive you've lost contact will happen\nIt was very difficult at some points and I decided to find a friend of my dodge way we used to go out to hung around with my dad so I went I left my bravo with them and I didn't tell them I have a plan to go somewhere else\nSo you was separated from your brother at the age of six yes he was to ... and up until very recently you haven't seen him again a tool you have no knowledge that he was still alive\nYeah um for some reason I had I had hoped I say he is strong enough he will survive if you know strong like the way I struggle he'll be day to because a little skewed died before on good food and stuff like\nThat and yeah I Know there's been a miracle\nOf cause yeah it's happened after ... eight nine nine news and I look at a mosque and it was kind of\nMiracle on him seeing may doesn't recognize me he said I don't know that guy [noise]\nHow'd you know this is your brother or somebody just contacted me because I'm I was trying to stay away a lot of 'em on the social media and stuff and not post myself because when I I I ...\nI got my professional contract football and a lot of people and all the way it stop posting pictures I said when I was six years old I lost my ... this country and if anybody finding a mile given this amount of money and stuff like that there is that these will be available and then there is so many people contact me for different kids\nAnd then finally there is one password and who may shed and my mother's name correctly so I said he might be the one so we arrange to do that DNA test and then we did it\n... um it's I felt cold like very cold like up to and said my ... and it was cold and it was like okay\nThis is not true false I didn't believe in the second thing what I did is to get a flight the next day well we'll see she was look at it in Uganda Kampala other strict cute as well I wanted to bring him to lump\nYes she is here with me living with me out so well south hike after all this time [noise]\nVery nice feelings like very very nice feeling this is the family that I was waiting for a long time\nAnd they've not even being living together for a week it was six days ago the um it moved in to it smells ... he was a truly inspirational young man up with me in the studio rope till they pay late and Ron I'm Michelle a rope 'til\nYou can probably identify with that story because you were an undocumented immigrant\n[noise] I'm absolutely I left Liberia when I was six years old I'm moved to the United states to join my mother and my father\nAnd pretty much overstayed my visa and lived in undocumented man limbo from the time I was six until I was about Twenty years old\nSo hearing that story what it really says to me is you know this sort of racist than a phobic populist notions that are migrants are um a purge on society that they are swarm who come in and feed off the system finite resources for those who are not documented\nUm who are documents that I should say it's just complete mess um this young man is a is emblematic of this year resilience and the great and the hard work\nThat migrants put in a many of them come from very difficult circumstances not for me I left Liberia before the war started but as a result of the war I had to remain in the United states and my parents shielded me for almost fourteen years\nFrom that fourteen year armed conflict um and as a result of that my parents had to work exceedingly hard um to pay for very exorbitant immigration fees to send me to private schools because public schools as too much questions about my status\nUm and so I think listening to this story should make a lot of us rethink our notions about migrants whether they be documented or undocumented that they actually contribute meaningfully to society um and that many of them come through very safe orderly in regular manners\nYeah he is achieved so much I mean so much more than most people would achieve with our whole lives already and unease barely getting started run and what did you make of that type\nI still I mean like real deal it was an absolute inspiring story and in many ways very useful look this global moment when it seems that migration is almost always associated in news headlines with negative stories stories about\nThe exploitation or stories that migrants and the take away jobs from indigenous populations that whichever of dislike self contradictory stories they come by speak truth at once\nAnd I think hearing it smells story mine just in fact we're not talking about a zero sum when migrants joined the community we're talking about a new contribution where the parts are more than the sum of\nThe whole this particular story actually I think is interesting because the cost he's gone on to imperial college London He's studying science and technology what are the areas where the country we're sitting the United kingdom\nDesperately needs to develop new specialization is a new skill set in those terms it's very clear that smell\nAnd his brother I guess a contributing to something that this country really needs\nIs smell and Ahmed have promised that they will come into the studio again until us how they're getting on a very much early days in their relationship just six days living

fundamentalism starts with green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I Would have actually thoughts and just look at different they the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd then they're they're at their pro you know\nThere are anti racist I mean I end up part of a large movement in Germany I mean it was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday\nTo uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people to turn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up\nSo they're they're pro tolerance or pro environment you know ... uh you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people are more interested in that kind of the main politics I've also heard people say you know at that mean that they see a few times for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they missed the humane policy and politics that used to be and not those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it or the migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\nAnd well it's because that migration has as since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country\nIf I did the way people think there are a lot of people who don't want people coming in and a lot of people who are doing very well particularly pensioners is also another issue and the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so to speak [noise] they're also worried about loss of\nAnd their their sense of German is are the very end us you know their culture they're afraid part of the things

their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope Cho\nJust looking back to that report from James no country from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows sticking with this topic of immigration that's the last speaker though was George ... founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant well she will take on that I did I thought\nIt was particularly ridiculous I mean\nQuite often migrants or people who have migraine ... I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls in detention to ensure that those people from across in Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more clan to sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers so your essential what you're doing is you're giving\nClass time forms of migration I'm an income um and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to some to be at more danger um so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican so harsh\nAbout migrants coming from from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric the same race is sort of xenophobia grabbing rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states I don't I don't know why this happened\nBecause you you'll rice I've heard this perspective before why would someone with it you just saw an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to that kind of I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a new notions across the globe have have done a fund I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this us and us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the senses you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who looked like me I'm may some sometimes funnel that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can have my ... which for me it's very warm psychologically that's that's the way of the world\nAround them is it your professor of history and politics of modern\nChina just how big an issue is immigration and China\nWill the really big issue there is no immigration the sense of people from outside China coming in but internal migration somebody like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nEssentially moved from their home villages throughout China to build buildings work on high speed railways and essentially provide the labor ... China but those people will not properly documented they can't claim for welfare pensioner education rights\nFor their children and that's where the single biggest problem safe in science today the question of poor people wanted to move to where the money is\nThe city's weekend from the BBC well service with me I like Fritz Germany's foot bowling side has continued they've lost three ... to the Netherlands that six defeat in ten games Alistair Ross joins me from ... how much pressure is that for a change of manager\nI ask a question of first defeats the metal and since Nineteen Ninety two first time ever that Germany I've gone three games without scoring that bought some of the three team European nations lake with to match has to go I'm facing a trip to world champions fronds next so\nGiven this all comes off they finished Baltimore if that group of the world cup of coffee angry and very public international retirement of ... despite the fact that he's won the world cup on a confederation scalp and his twelve years in charge ... your your love knows the pressure to perform is growing\nVolunteer to just sit with all their own the hall and disappointing managed to lose three Neal in the first few minutes we have control and created a few chunks days I'll biggest problem is we're not taking them the situations that word wedding training didn't work in the matches disappointing the way we played in the last ten minutes when we can see two goals\nAt this level that shouldn't happen so that amount of hours in the first thing\nThat was the big match in Europe on Saturday and the Africa Cup of nations qualifies and ball boys to one way in the Congo amount of gas cars will know went away at equitable real game provided the shocks while much area and South Africa both both posted it very big wins\nThey put themselves in prime position now to be the two sides to qualify from groups\nPay and in China should we be surprised that Roger Federer has failed to make the final of the Shanghai group and I think\nA match but it will just fast events in the U.S I buy the month ago so in that sense perhaps not but being in the semi final against the Twenty one year old\nWho never reached the final Adam officer bent default federal was all basically going to be the favorite in the end on a charge posted a surprise six ... six fall when he spoke to his final place against ... but federal they still happy with how he's performed in Shanghai\nI'm happy ... to ... this week I feel like I'm explosive out there I'm returning well and they're serving to you know I think it's it's okay could be even a little bit better um I don't think I played a match where I didn't get broken so that's something [noise]\nBut it's more unusual for me but um this week I felt like I was hitting the ball well and I think that's something that I can definitely take along with me\nOn that final charge against jock itch gets underway in around two hours type\nAlistair Ross thank you very much you're listening to weekends from the BBC well ... from my guests Ron I mentioned professor of history and politics of multi ...

I'm Sorry I think the ... little cut off here yeah it it it's not the best I was a question\nOr a few um and in fact Rob till\nWe hear so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of United States the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world they'll say look\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer uprising or less the financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment I think those will serve as deterrent\nThe practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe so that people really face the full weight of the long run up\nAnd I think it's very important that liberal governments exercise that kind of transparency in a society corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the\nUh the waterfront countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways cracking down on corruption a more effective and the liberal will have to have an answer to that\nWe're having all sorts of trouble with the lines of you have to say goodbye to our friends from Amnesty International but I thought of as\nA newspaper article written that you've written a in front of me here and this is well this is corruption automate just go buy a movie star in China\nJust tell me a ... it's in this morning's London Sunday Times and it's basically about funding being the single most famous movie style celebrity in China sixty million followers on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter and she said she disappeared in July reappeared only three months later and very mysterious circumstances with the tax bill\nFor a hundred and twenty nine million US dollars which is almost the size of BBC present the salary I agree yeah but I said well of course but it's basically a sign that China is willing in this case to basically make examples that incredibly famous incredibly well and then people\nTo get the idea that new but he remains on touch of course many of these people one suspects that people who have fallen found with the Chinese leadership said it's by no means transparent but there is a sign out there in China at the moment that a state of contagious wealth shutting off your wealth\nIs no longer perhaps in fashion and that's linked with the anti corruption movement\nRupture lost on this point if you have to sum up inside the seconds we do have a lot of young listeners on the b._b._c.

professor of history and politics of Martin China on runner I go to copy of today's Sunday Times newspaper here with me and you write about the corruption charges against the Interpol president in China [laughter]\nThat's right and in many will know that he was arrested last week in Beijing and is now being put up on bribery charges in China but it's part of a much bigger story which is a crackdown by paying the Chinese leader\nAnd his Communist Party government on not just corruption but actually political opposition as well so the two things come together\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting phenomenon which is really big in China the grows an ultrasound intelligence and virtual reality so\nThe state is using tech for surveillance in China\nMuch more than any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for his will just surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards on on those not just\nThe financial details or your rent a criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's a real social change happening in China and this\nAnti corruption story is just one policy that just because I read\nAn extraordinary thing on the news was yesterday and this was the the the the software that is in in the hands of the Chinese state was going to be used to target the credit rating to lower the credit rating of anyone found smoking in public\nThat's right it's what's called social credits in other words if you do things that are not criminal but or in some ways against public morals could be crossing the road wrong place almost seriously of course criticizing the government that will be on the record and you might find that for instance you turn up at the railway station you want to buy a rail ticket\nAnd your ID card says sorry you don't have enough social credit points to actually do that it's a completely new way of controlling the population and it's going to get bigger and bigger role\nDo you mentioned earlier in the program about your research on race based immigration in some West African countries how much debate you say about this and the country's concern for\nLet's race based citizenship causes so the countries Liberia and Sierra Leone which I'm we're formally um slave sort of a slave history with those two countries where former on many methods slates from the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have race citizenship clauses that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and Sierra Leone\nUm and what's fascinating for me about this historically is that you know the Westphalia and system says uh or or sort of use whiteness as a reference for citizenship white and it's a male and it says a reference for citizenship but what these countries are effectively doing and you can debate whether or not it's right or wrong\nIs that they're centering blackness as a reference for citizenship and for me this is incredibly revolutionary\nI was sitting at the archbishop teach with my tape recorder that healthy now and then suddenly almost at the end of the time there was the

atmosphere of great joy and celebration they're having two major celebrations tonight in different places one being the ... the jewel downtown where he gave those Sunday homily that made him so famous the other\nIs the little chapel on the grounds of a hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while saying mass one night\nThat will be people who have never heard of Oscar Romero who is why she's so important\nWas the archbishop appear in ... the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he was he was really be loved\nAnd respected because he spoke out very strongly about injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing does life he was shot to death the day after\nHe gave a Sunday sermon directing themselves specifically to the members of the armed forces and saying to them you\nDo not have to obey and the moral ordered to go out and and kill people and that did not go down well with some of the authorities who killed him\nWell it was for the most part people from you know on the government side the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out that there was a growing leftist movement here then surely\nGrew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed if you will you make a mistake and are you do something wrong and you could count on him\nFollowing Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killers have never been brought to justice why not\nWell for a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and with that the case couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court has overturned that and the law and\nActually this week in Rome the leader of the Catholic Church cardinal roast the child has has said he thinks

getting about he was one way or the other races\nYou had a lot of people will be quite surprised to hear this but except perspective that say much in recent years what do you see evidence somehow McGahn deep being racist [noise] when\nYou look at the relations in Malawi has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and they are business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in ... as the Indian Malawi doesn't leave him ... doesn't really socialize with a list of the ... community so from my perspective there's a context that argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in ... and as you said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise] he is\nThe point from in the government is protective is more or less like how they argued in gonna win a gun in government was forced to take it starts to get my to my gun from the rest of the argument is that it has been sort
