sweetness actually he uh he when he asked his press conference um he didn't want to run his press conference will actually just finished in a class on the intermediate macroeconomics so he seems to be quite committed a committed to this\nUm and I'm actually not just the mistake that I think the uh ... who ... to ... that was actually the will buy the IMF my my apologies that I Know where it's a well let's talk about professor I'm at I'm\nAt well he's a little younger um he is currently as I say at a at Yale University and he's he's basically looks us away all are\nSeeing how economic activity affects the environment what are the consequences and also how to evaluate responses are such as should you should you or I introduce common taxes make common more expensive and that's certainly one of the things that he's advocated\nIt's quite interesting because both of these um both of these people who've won they've obviously they've both got that work has um a a an emphasis on

environmental problems\nI knew it thank you very much [noise] news they ... on\nDreams called no review and more trouble Silicon Valley this time it's Google that's the whole system investigation by Wall Street journal has revealed the Google apparently knew about a potential to bridge and it's Google Plus social networking bought from but failed to disclose this\nTo the public all to the regularly to our North American technology reporter they really gave me more details Google\nEverybody that it had discovered a symbol Rebecca phase in in Google Plus Google Plus has the company's social networks that it's fair to say has never been used by many people are so but it's always existed says two thousand and eleven they launched it as an attempt to take on Facebook\nThey dramatically filed of that but it's still been part of Google's wider system\nAnd you remember back in March Facebook was going through the Cambridge Analytica scandal where they had\nThis practical consult see five has used third party apps to scrape data from Facebook users and it was a massive\nIntrusion into the personal ... uses\nAround about the same time Google thought well maybe that was going to happen to them so they assessed that road systems on Google Plus the sea of such a a a similar way to get ... would have been possible and Google process and they found out a sure enough that it was possible and Google Plus now the difference here of course\nIs that Google found this out they decided that probably most serious enough to to share this with anybody you know its uses all regulators and so it wasn't until this report from the wall Street Journal\nAnything about this asshole I'm now Google say yes we did find that we didn't think he was serious enough however we are going to shut down Google Plus which seems like a dramatic mood but that was very few people using it in the first place and this is kind of\nAlmost pushing Google Plus out of its misery because he was always something of a something of a dead network walking is the fries I think would fit nicely here\nWas this comparable to ... to a kind of the toxin is being to bridge\nThese kind of circumstances of what was possible ... exactly the same ... the the only real difference between the truth is if Facebook you know he's the biggest social network in the world with two and a half billion\nUsers Google Plus belly hides well they said the number affected by this branch was half a million of its uses the speculation that may have been the entirety of the side because they've never said how popular Google policies are many people would suspect that that low number was because it was\nThe because the threat was minimal I just because they say if it wasn't that many people using Google process about quantity of uses rather than a any any difference between the two two potential breaches\nI Wonder what this all means for the protection um and especially with all these questions arise about with the these the need to regulate the facebooks and Google does world a bit more\nYes won't Silicon Valley is absolutely petrified of regulation right now with alarming regularity we saying Silicon Valley bosses facing the Senate in Washington one of the things the ... general discovered ... internal memos\nFrom the time they discovered this law saying if this was public it could result in increased pressure from regulators um and that's one of the reasons why they decided not to disclose what they'd found\n[noise]\nI mean there's ... on the b._b._c. world says scientists here in the ... have found that people boom with a higher risk of having a heart attack could be identified by one of genetic test roughly half of ... diseases down to genetics at is to say the risk is inherited\nYeah the ... lifestyle into environmental factors\nProfessor ... from the University of Leicester he's only research\nBut we know that called the ... important component but now they met these genetic component sufficient information to get into it was actually I think it was well if you can any risk this risk\nSo hey you're cutting out the lifestyle choices and that site and just going straight to ... you are given out the genetically\nLifestyle or to your to your risk of gory hot\nAnd given that does it make sense that for example this test should be done on children so you know the earliest possible stage who might be at risk\nSo many factors like your lifestyle is a small K diabetes in middle age\nIt in a way to get really apply this genetic test your risk of course you would want to share that information basically child but I Would say that if you\nHave to do it I think knowing this risk which we didn't really think hard if you start doing it for your forty high has already started to vet\nSo saying this test is done on an Eighteen year old it finds out that person is predisposed to these sorts of problems what will be the next step then\nReally important question because many people you can't do anything about your inherited risks\nCan find people that I was thinking Louis for those individuals saying that changing your lifestyle can be no smoking making sure you'll need all the way to ensuring that your committee and of course some people using drugs like start is what was your age maybe very beneficial in preventing the disease\nHow far are we away from this test being widely used\nSo that the lord you know you know in terms of the thing is very simple single one of the question of course is being able to\nLike the results of it interpret them will point individuals' getting good invaded\nIn ... it's a challenge\n... challenge indeed that's professor ... from the University of Leicester which is quite compelling idea isn't it

HIV positive individual had been bad ... two thousand and searching\nWhen logo change somebody to hook act and the hope\nThe organs and this was really based on research that was done in South Africa by our colleagues in Cape Town where because of the critical organs shortage and or the lack of access to dialysis for HIV positive kidney failure patients they started using HIV positive deceased donors into HIV positive recipients was very good results off and I also\n... basically means um they they don't pass on\nThe condition or no they they already had it because those are HIV positive to reach out to HIV positive right so this is my this is quite dramatic what what was the urgency in in in this case why wasn't it possible to find a a a known a positive and these negative live up to give to the to give to the child\nThat's absolutely imperative so that we this child is being a diagnosed with end stage disease had been on our way to invest\nIn Johannesburg that program is I mean our average uh wasting time in the forty eight days this child had been on the list for a hundred and eighty days the mom obviously we declined living done all of a chance on section for it because of the HIV positive state says two other potential Seventy members came forward both\nUnsuitable living donors\nAnd the top continue to deteriorate on a waiting list uh she just wasn't getting a translator frequent admissions for life threatening complications of the liver disease and we've already felt like this window of opportunity was closing on us and we had exhausted all other opportunities as all solutions to get her transplanted\nAnd really the head with face of this decision or you know ... and the parents in fact I was already fill the parents made the brave choices\nAre with the choice between days of the child or accepting and HIV positive ... ... a\nLedge with all the good is ma'am it is a dreadful\nEthical motion of choice and I just imagine having to make that what I was ... is the case that usually a match with a mother\nIs likely to be successful I mean what would that always for being the best choice had the mother not being HIV positive absolutely our living like this yes that would have already looking at a magic bullet but you couldn't use it because of this issue now please updates us it's a year since the ... was taken how what both doing\nBoth are doing brilliant in fact the mom has a completely\nRecovered tend to work I'd written to her quality of life that she had before the operation or she just had the scar and ability to to prove it\nThe child is doing wonderfully well as well so Fifteen months on the line a live is functioning fantastically well a out of the top of the two year old and doing everything else\nThat is the early ... now you were looted a little bit early on I'm sort of very briefly I just need to know does this make an important test case for the future you alluded to the find that there was a horrendous lack of does not all comes in South Africa does this make things easier\nThis does um it's we're cautious in making that statement however\nUh that that could become the new reality when he can use this uh HIV positive organs or to instead of living to an end to HIV negative recipients we do feel that this is going to open up therapeutic options are full of patients in dire need of organ transplants and\nI Want to thank you for coming on congratulate you on the same amount of course of the family involved as well who don't wish understandably to be identified very young child and the mother as well that was professor\n... the chief of liver transplantation at ... medical center in Johannesburg\nHere listening can you stay on the b._b._c.

this is a sort of preppy style of young white men are too expensive universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself ex athletes not just for one group it's can be for me I'm like why was\nThat this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public stick his head but more generally in sexual terms I could you say something about your

visibility that sense of pride making a life for themselves in Britain despite over in spite of\nThe racism the ... system that was rising in Britain the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties so there was this continuous actually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to season\nSo up to this point we've defined coolest largely an African American concept something that was developed by Charles musicians as a result of being on the outside of not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of crew was manufacturing itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one on one time\nHauling Jimmy Johnson all the towns and all of them were all\nWalks of mine [noise]\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine on duty Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael countries including this was a new type of crude which ... the concept to the Hollywood movie audience with the new popularity of what was known as filmed wrong how does filmed while relate to cool\nWell film water protecting us are disillusioned I'm cynical the owners who often get embroiled in criminal activities [noise] this type of curse on ruffled male character was launched by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn the shadow ... water world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why do you think there's this idea these here as he's cool here it resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface ah America was celebrating its victory over fascism enrolled\nBoom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface there was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future\nSo for film the wire to I refused that to reject optimism was a ... way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt marginalized so in cinema\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic that film in the war was not this was a genre that was steeped in gloom and cynicism and disillusionment\nUntil you said that the cool appealed if this film law is linked to the post war popularity in front says ... says like oh but ... ... can you briefly explain why\nIn a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence\nA Albert ... who writes a book called the rebel a study of mad and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy\nAnd my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool if he says that I rebel therefore we exist and what he meant by that is if you're a rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels\nWhere's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with some of my comfort Bogart a Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model for fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said Americans sort of patriotism\nAnd so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\n[noise] we've been talking about jobs have been talking about film we've been talking about this for the ... recalled approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and in different sections of society and different countries [noise] the thing that strikes me is that all these kinds of ... men where are the women can't women be cool to Cairo\nYes they can and I mentioned earlier Billie Holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she is being seen as a female ... so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an expresses that in all aspects of their lives and used his clothes and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of mind and in the ... that means for them\n[noise] okay so that's a a female ... what about in film to a\nA N filming a wire women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nUm they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film to our farm fatality is depicted as dangerous evil ... mostly in dark shadows at night\n[noise] okay so what do you think about this idea that maybe the whether the the icons of who seem to be mostly men\nOr if you're talking about jazz musicians\nSort of a rebel loner that tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to his cool in a headline or is it a scripture and of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the ban found like huge from the eighties or nineties\nAnd since twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chris behind and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool has never really been associated them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell in the moment we will be taking a closer look at how cool developed and how that rebels spirit was taken out and buy later generations that's in part to this for him from the b._b._c.

I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re according to this is a film that spoke for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but it's also point here that these with the new teenagers very much opposed fulfillment\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time\nAh to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time for perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city is after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do their so you've had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time having the luxury of\nRebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nCount all the style that these films the fashion chain to be seen as cruel to didn't as just one of the actors\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the world to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course is a teacher to white T shirt is everyday object which started um\nAs part of a naval uniform and around Nineteen so teen was seen on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire than warmed by James Dean in rebel without a cause this\nDreaming white T shirts under red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with a a pair of jeans could save some things so radical\nOne of the other major she goes from his parents we mustn't forget to him voted that rebels spirit was the thing I Elvis Presley\n\nJoe so what did Elvis fits into the pantheon of cool\nElvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worshipped Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could grill plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando is kind of a shock looking back\nBut the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also heads on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something somewhat a rich you know with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he has often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his\nSinging and his take on NASCAR contrition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time\nSo we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact to people like James Dean into Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's tons which are just such an idea of cool across the landscape but I Wonder what you will see in Kobe really choking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named where I ... we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed to capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your what's your view on the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this isn't punch because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nThat cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures\nAdolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebel style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persistent both on the former colonies and then the farmer ...\nSounds that picked young post colonial rebels um the French Film la Han from Nineteen Ninety five directed by much it costs the vets\nAnd which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out how to respond to police violence the bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish\nOne of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about this idea of coups cultural imperialism\nFor me not just about the kind of a tough thing down if you like but it was that what ... saying is that making use if those references to create something new and to say something new\nAbout their own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground away one started cruelest being taken by another generation and turned it into it saying I'm not as we've been hearing who hasn't remained static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cool which seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream conformity that we've been talking about so it was cool today there's\nConformity cool marketing cool and there's rebel cool and the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things and then there's the grassroots rebel cool in which\nPeople and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming\nBut for me the rebel cool part the part that still vital alive I Would define rebel cool simply dissuade cool is how we go she ate maternity\nIn late adolescence to icons of popular culture between like the age of Seventeen and twenty five and we're looking for self definition and you will find yourself and I kind of cool that guides you there\nYou're listening to the ideas

I graduated from college and decided to just help her do a business plans and help set everything up and so that plus has assigned place\nSo that the mistakes that she made in the past would not

found that that was a gap between what consumers will looking for as well as what the industry was providing\nA lot of people go for the show treatments ... treatments edit them at all adjust or they

company and a growing company\nI think we saw says there's always something we have to juggle we have to be smart we can never play the game like how the ... thing gamble with Johnson and Johnson ... bad\nWhen Lee a marketing I think the most important is a well what if all\nThe referrals that all this thing clients give to their friends the kind of testimonials Wendy share hey look this is a great facial faith I found is a great part amusing must try this try arms any thing that you say about yourself on line or off line\nI Would say that it's was remembering inside this industry economic and he says\n... eight to ten clients today you don't need to acquire a social media following up hundreds of thousands have a successful business\nIf he calculates the amount of couple hours you helping you months they might be two hundred so you need to do is find two hundred clients uh seem not twenty percent of them are going to be regulars and loyalty and cultivate relationships with those\nPeople because when it comes to a beauty the lifetime body of customers can run into the thousands I've been with my hairdresser for nine years I've been with my ... you know so it's not always about big numbers and influence marketing it's about\nSmall numbers but having higher quality relationships with your customers\nThat connection physically I'm with the beauty and your parents who are making over the ... the industry the Singaporeans spot or not pointing out\nAnd ... who founded ... now and the beauty networking site beauty stack when you look at the ship and the bull dreams of the major beauty companies they still seem to be one maybe by men putting the other end of immigration you have women working\nPaid quaint body the reserves you paid workers Whitey thing that is that women working these industries pizza ...\nI Do believe that some of the Asian type in like these conglomerates that come from Japan or Korea they are largely male dominated\nBut in fact I'm looking at the small medium enterprises in Singapore that have grown over the last twenty Thirty years we're fairly good repetition many of them I started by women\nAnd women that are about my mom's age which is like fifty five fifty eight years old so they have been in this line for the last Thirty years\nSo I guess being into beauty industry in Singapore we are a little bit fortunate in that way where I Believe that that is a good mix of apologies for women to to be an entrepreneur and to shine and do well as well [noise]\nThe second part on whether or not women um lowly paid and why is that the situation being an industry we do know lightest industry rate especially for the front line technicians who are the beauty therapists all the front line ... because in part I was no minimum wage\nBut I strongly believe it is the choice of entrepreneur the business owner on how they wanted to structure del wages if you want your employees to be that crammed cram the best employees out there then you have to pay a little bit ah not just a little bit or you have to pay above\nThe average not just minimum wage above average and structure compensation system such that they know that they would be compensated for good luck not just in sales and service and technical expertise and we offer a career progression so they know that\nFor example has got a girl with us and said that ... assistant who now is running my entire climbed relations operations team in the last five years she's been five years and that kind of progression would have been very very ... take on how much longer\nCan carry a progression says one the one where you ... and I'm just wondering ... in terms of the new business things like maternity leave and paternity leave we tend to be on the cold for women in your progressing with um decrees how do you deal with that I Would\nDisagree with pulling statement that it's the choice of the entrepreneur or to remove the barrios lowly wages NBC\nBecause when I said to you out of his I you know I didn't enjoy running this business in those days is because I felt the feeling comfortable with paying another go like eight pounds in Iowa it made me feel weird to do that because\nIt just didn't sit right with me about this is where I disagree with the fact that it's the choice of the entrepreneur\nBeauty is not seen as a essential old a therapeutic old house giving surveys right [noise]\nSo because the market right for beauty is in finish treatment is low you can't pay higher wages because the economics of your business will not walk so you can get your nails done I'm Talking full of a critic Niles\nFull I've seen a credit announces low sixteen pounds right now for sixteen pounds it takes about an hour so you're taking away the wage the other's heads the cost of goods the cost of products et cetera\nYou ... then pay a higher wage so when you were doing you'll ...\nYou'll like how much can I pushed the treatment to tie my team a fair wage and then a wall we charge fifty pounds were critics very expensive we have a salon in central London we use the best quality products I saw it on is hygiene Nick on looks nice and isn't generally\nOne of these we don't make much sense of profit because I'm choosing to pay on now technicians fairly there any reason I can make these choices it because I I Know that ... and other business prospects in other

century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of ... it wasn't necessarily pick the well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to economy easel to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing it so far as the\nUh one of the ways to do that has often been to X\nBeing more dangerous or less serious or less intelligent because of the way that gender roles of being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded why they may want to hunt and don't pay anything\nBecause that would lend the field moral authority how

studio at WWF rocket seeing who's been leading this for such welcome to the program tell us a bit more about those conditions I mean they're pretty boy for we're talking sometimes range is not even having ... boots\nRight say imagine if you are living in a very ... location away from your family you don't have access to clean drinking water you don't have access to clean toilets each other basic needs of any human being what is happening to the rangers have\nDoes not have access to all these things at the same time the walking under extremely dangerous conditions at this point just an oncologist or stealing these animals from the forest and also they are going through the\nMental stress rain just have to stay away from their families and we had done a study on the mental stress and it's it's it's\nWhat what's the situation is that ranges of walking under that seem to difficult dangerous conditions Wade noted cognition\nIsn't it the case that you know by not having the equipment they need and as you say suffering high rates of illness because of wherever working I mean that's ... ... but it's going to make anybody not willing to go the extra Marlin doing their job particularly if a job as a dangerous one\n... but it was quite surprising like we did the subway also raise the largest ever study done on ranges and we were quite surprised when the rain just said that they really want they're they're really proud of that war they love what the tea but at the same time we have to make sure\nThat if you really want them to continue doing this war than we have to support them be have to give them equipment for example ... boots\nHalf of them don't even have boots and they end up spending their own money for buying boots and uniform when every dream just salary is nine dollars a day which is more or less than actually uh somebody makes in McDonalds\nSo how do we how do we change the situation I mean clearly it's up to the governments of the country is concerned but I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the rangers or is being on the opposite but where's it going I think\n... ... ... so we have to look at three\n... number one is the rangers or the government employees so it'd be neat to look into the policies that are decided that the ... just training of ranges their insurance ballot benefits they're family very sad\nAnd those are the phones needs to come to\nThe challenge we head is a leading had the ... data that we can do the politicians say okay now you're ranges out and really bad shape change your policies now we have that information so that has to be done all kinds of Asian groups and\nI'm interested people need to come together to address the policy and number two is all the conservation group also need to invest more resources and the basic needs for example a piece of study clearly shows\nThat are the sites where and Jews are supporting contribution groups of supporting ranges and they just have better access to clean drinking water so maybe we need to\nInvest more into the basic needs of ranges and number three which is equally important is to create a Venus above range is how do we make\nAnybody in Asia and Africa do you have the feeling young young generation that school to be at age ...\nJust one very very quick point I mean how confident are you about is going to happen I mean one of us talking statistics is that sixty percent of Thursday surveys would worry about the safety if they reported corruption that was pretty troubling isn't it\nIt it it is and and that's why we have to uh\nWalk with the national governments and to add to address these issues I think corruption is definitely one of the issue that has been raised by ranges but data bigger issues which needs to be addressed like a health and safety and the training and equipment that\nI'm I'm pretty positive because the first time we have a quantifiable information we can go in law will be the goal met earlier today and had this information\nRight ... thanks for coming in Santa Rosa singer WWF\n[noise] as far as young Filipinos a singer
