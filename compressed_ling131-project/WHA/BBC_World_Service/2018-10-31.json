November ... starting at seven\nBoth side of the time at across different countries in terms of how does majoring in social media impact upon public reaction terror events and the reason for doing that really is to try and put out some similarities and differences because there there was some times [noise]\nA slight tendency to just say this is a is a new problem but what we want to do with say actually some evidence of of this problem has deep roots and then there are some things that have been changed by the presence of social made during the ways in which the major environment has changed the last few years\nIt's like for instance in the case of the Bataclan you you've got people in the venue that night who are sending out at social media empires things people in the area but what does that say ... what did you learn from looking at that kind of studying\nOne of the really interesting things about the ... case study but we've seen similar patterns and others as well if you do have\nIndividuals in the same ... to the fall I was ... in that and that was sort of horrific things Gail that's quite important because from from a case in point of view will replace it never quite sure of\nIs this a genuine message or is this someone one of the terrorists inside the venue who has a hold of some ... someone's torture cap and is deliberately trying to do them for confrontation [noise] so you try to get these very\nVery dynamic situations that increase the pressure on place decision by cars so they cut to decide what are they going to do with ... that is coming out in in these kinds of seeds and the ... a case was a particular example of that\nAnd in other cases we see\nExamples of where people are really you're earning for real time information if people right in the community and the emergency responders for instance the Boston Marathon in twenty Seventeen that's an interesting case of a mess that we're being protected by the terrorists but also I buy recalls happen the terrorist attack it so\nWell you see is you see all these different act is kind of coming in to play now and there's a lot of population political\nInterests of the current time around misinformation disinformation among other things we would try to do is try and say well actually in in the minutes Oscar terror attack and in the house and sometimes the days\nIt's really hard to know precisely what is guy all because yes you do have genuine contributes to social media who tried to promote public undecided will happen but you said the people who have tried to agitate the situation trying to mislead decision full\nSay what are you having fresh respond as emergency services and in the major organizations\nWell I think one of the things that strikes me about having looked across a large number of terror events is\nThere is enormous pressure these situations to get information out there to kind of be the person to break the story to kind of get that kind of skill\nBut actually it's similar when people get it wrong and this does happen quite regularly that people get it wrong that has quite ... detrimental effects in terms of trusted institutions and trust and in democracy and those kinds of things and these things can be exploited\nSo what kind of say there are risks to guy out too early and there are things that you can do to try and manage those risks so for example rather than just reacting to an event has a plot ... who are you guys talked to who\nTakes ... is just trying to avoid the information vacuum that so often is just filled by the ... and maybe some harmful malicious messages as well designed to cause disruption\nThat ... what are the key findings rallies by by looking back over an extended period of time we're able to to track how place in governmental responses have changed at all to the ... to to to the dudes they should've are but I Am one of those things it's quite clear is\nIf they say nothing if they do leave that vacuum that other people will come here to make mischief so it's really important\nFor all the place of government and politicians to be able unclear to say in these kind of moments of the budget crisis where people are very ... you know this is what we can tell you so that you don't leave a cat so others could come into the field of misinformation disinformation\nPops mountain in ... and build homes and you read that report what did you make of it\nI'm I think it's really important what especially because it's each well researched and ... and he changed you know it's one of the things this is just sensible\nIt is clear that this will help because what he does he's allows organizations that are responsible in some way for the inflation float around these terrible events to think about how they respond\nTo have a strategy in place which we can follow that makes it much less likely that they will just do something to magically or make a mistake because your formal likely to get you roll if you go on your instincts at the time like this\nAnd I think it offers also advice for all of us made overseas as journalists were taken intimation coming out but also anyone who's got access to Facebook Twitter or any other social media which is\nThink carefully about the messages that Europe could find was well you know they're just automatically retreat somebody ... sounds like your friend

different level of understanding about certain game development techniques or you know certain mechanics or various things that you know gamers ... understand intuitively most people who are not cameras will not and so that's a real interesting design challenge when we've done\nIs bring a visual flair to it at the centrally quite simple game\nSo that people can pick up something I learned very quickly a but it has enough steps that you can play it for you know the three five months of your recovery [noise] the balance tests are\nAre designed so that the physio therapists can measure specific strengths and specific improvements in your balance as your training so when you first come in they can get a baseline [noise] and they'll do you know a static balance test or a dynamic found says depending on what you were working on [noise]\nAnd then each time you come back into the clinic they can measure your progress and they could see quite visually and quite easily they can show you

A. and you end NPR joined me this afternoon\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nAnother example to the problem is is there's a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that non citizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check\nThat's a problem and is the problem that many states have show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place\nGive them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are stirring up a specter for problem where there was really a problem how you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election\nYou have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes [noise] it would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and is probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level\nAnd many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\nFor taking the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate packing the focus oppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient are scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think frankly borders on racist to believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose curious the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to a depressed turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down\nThe exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready them and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the mold and fight the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud\nI think it's a very small problem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there\nThere might be a county here or a county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nThat if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out ... you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting and fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocks from the polls\nThat have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually fraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem\nIs that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to orange swayed from participating\nBecause of barriers that have been erected to the ballot box\n... evidence you have that they actually do I think\nThere's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduce voter turnout and at a reduced voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally\nThis and Tennessee I think if you look at the hands of Republicans have claimed many different occasions that these laws have helped them or would it be that it out and Eric key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that your people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina state board of elections did a careful review and they found ... five hundred cases people voting you shouldn't have isn't that evidence of vote to froze I almost Ari\nIf you look at the case then from there weren't Hubbard most of the time they weren't ex felons\nWho didn't realize there are knowledgeable to know there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they asked about because there is a very very steep price to pay I mean you're talking about potentially a facing ... years in jail a steep fines\nAll for one vote and most people would not do that if they knew what the penalties would be\nMost of his ex felons didn't in the end face any further action bumped in elements county twelve people were prosecuted and they soon became known as the elements twelve\nBecause roaches was one of them and for this program the dark sides of American democracy here on BBC will service she agreed to meet me she was setting up the ball in Greensboro where she works\nGreen or old woman when I was a um [noise]\nI was on probation so at that time I wasn't aware that it made me an eligible to vote because no one that told me that had I known I was breaking the law\nI Would not have you know made any moves to go vote I Would have just [noise]\nTell me what happened off the election\nWell after the election I'm guessing here so we passed and\nAfter I got off work one day I came home to a note on my door stating that I had a long way from Iraq so I contacted the aftermath county sheriff's department and they and for me that I had a warrant for felonies voting\nThe lady kind of was

think ending twenty four months of my life away from my home my job I my kid is worth voting you know again if I Would have known that I was not able to vote I Would not have broken the law and decided to vote anyway not blatantly\nElection coming up in November\nWhat's your situation now you've taken this three day or you are on probation no no I Am\nActually off of probation free clean and

misnomer but addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it they're babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies their infants that\nWere exposed to a substance in utero that exposure if long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that stuff says once they are born and they no longer have that substance being provided they become at risk of going through withdrawal and what parts of um withdrawal symptoms debates\nSo babies have the same which all Simpsons as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI systems so vomiting diarrhea excessive\nVolume off they have respiratory symptoms so they breathe fast they have difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kitten here which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing those babies are incomes olive oil and crying that is babies don't handle that you and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for\nHours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick babies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours\nBut these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crime they sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down or stayed\nThe same certainly is racing I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly

I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context\nIf you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time with the birth rate in their states with about seven\nPer woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states and that era\nIf you look at later ear as this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new bodies\nIf you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy then the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low\nSo I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... son um editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of the classic American narrative that's of the panelists immigrant who arrived to seek a new life on through hard work determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to the Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of integration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was\nRestricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship and in the grants were welcome to that is white people were welcomed there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nAnd there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship\nAnd they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narratives and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people
