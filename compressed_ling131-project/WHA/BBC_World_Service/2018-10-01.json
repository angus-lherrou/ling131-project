La Nina setting and the other much in the twenty eighth team was going to be calm about\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nYou know that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shops across puffing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early nine ... among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages Bernie parts of the climate story and know the ... that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we sort of climate scientists and in our efforts\nToo often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on the earth to continue to increase and that has huge ramifications for global sea level rise from melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes\nAnd so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines\nThat is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless Oslo to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of rule does happen every yeah\nAll right let one go well not necessarily harming our what we can say that I mean why won't do any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that that is typical\nQuite rare and is now I ran into the call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived herds of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you'd take\nExtreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream\nIn a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California west seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael mine\nCalifornia it's getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um the summer droughts\nUh so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season in California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was\nThe Thomas wildfire last winter in southern\nThis summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire in northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the the profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nTo us\nFrom our historic or margins are you a larger fires are more and more you know

electric cars and an eight and to the collapse into housing nights with\nWhat I'm getting too is that the John Macdonald ... the the current shadow chancellor of the extra kit here in the case has

to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and that would be a cap on the amount of dividend to be received by each worker on the access beyond that would go to the

capitalizing by corporations going into the public will fund and then the dividends are distributed to the former universal basic evident\nWhereas the Labour Party is leaving them up amongst the

will range of environmental problems in the area including a high flooding risk and poor access to transportation [noise] this is what he's had in his speech\nIf these two problems and not to be solved it would be like building a ... no rubbish tip meet the ... the government props up for this new town\nWell Gabriel will ... is the Shanghai bureau chief for the Financial Times he went to the site recently this is what he so\nIt's definitely still early days for this mega project I visited when they were just completing the centerpiece of the first days the film on public service Centre and that is a kind of many city within it maybe that include electric cars charging stations and\nSensors are based on that recognition twenty thousand sensors around the whole city is a future hotel that that includes human being free checking they planted thousands of trees around as a dancer but beyond that a public service Centre it's still quite\nA quite barren where basically still you know could read an almond trees surrounding yeah central service center\nWell George magnet is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects and it's getting the large dip\nA historically on something changed in a two thousand they actually as the financial crisis in the west started to send ripples through China\nAnd uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself was actually going through a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happening in the last ten years in particular I Would say about the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so Everytime they call me looks like it's looking a little bit wobbly\nUm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments are on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a ... and leads to better growth\nAnd she is a huge contentious issue because some of us believe actually the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model\nA because actually if it was that simple than every when you need for groceries just build ...\n... ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same return that it did it in the first\nLike yes indeed I think again you know like so many things in China and everything is so nuanced so if you look at China's a in a residential buildings and its infrastructure of population of course it's still some way behind Japan\nA soul in Asia or you know American cities in European cities but um you know as long as ... the kind of famous British economist once said in the long run we're all dead\nAnd uh what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks ... and I'm actually quite a lot of problems\nAnd it can also leader goals to huge amounts of public debt where how biggies Chinese public debt well uh it\nIs about the end of two thousand and Seventeen was around three hundred and thirty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat ... there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis infuse but certainly the the miss allocation of resources\nThe cumulative increase its difficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing um funding bad loans you know what they have to raise deposits and\nIf they can't raise them from households they are raising them from increasingly a new bullets Harlan uncertain short term so since I'm not saying these things are contrived to to bring about kind of some uncertainty now\nYou've written a book called red flags I mean how much jeopardy is China and from the Aspen and other risks\nWell I think I'm trying to ... the only problem that China faces it's also facing you know kind of a confluence of lots of problems aging\nI'm you know technology um the currency stability and so on\nThe difference that I think uh the last few years of made is that Xi Jinping's governance system has changed China or a ... now I'm not clear whether you know intensely autocratic society with top down guidance and control is the most efficient\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin
