or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're\nGoing to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior account\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these terms man's spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it must be provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic he mentions that cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\nI Would come by itself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the union yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices\nYou seat never before had to stall will steal had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and this got some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at directing Ryan jumps and\nSome of them except for the behavior that look a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that look alike\nThere were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls I've been sort of themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nThat you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer attack say that's the kind of idea just generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society it's like the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who would agree and something could disagree\nBut if ... all rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating de spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nAs Yoda says anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already look with

to cry sits on friday I spoke to key time preserve drunk policy expert at Stanford University what could politicians on this a new legislation white has\nJust said drugs caused says Cindy ... such momentum\nWe have three waves tidbits nationally it starts due to poor regulation a pharmaceutical companies could make opioids\nOf prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for about Fifteen Years and that bothers to level like about six times per capita way you would see in Great Britain for example\nBack on many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they open up shop and a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase\nAnd then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration\nOf heroin supply with fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid far more potent than heroin and that has turned a disaster into a catastrophe you know upper scale we haven't seen and drug policy and in several generations\nReally what does tend to know and why it has become so popular among uses\nFentanyl is entirely synthetic opioids that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab or you can make it and you're saying\nThere for many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China which has a large chemical industry in a large pharmaceutical industry they're not tightly regulated\nAnd with the Internet they've been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done is established links with Mexico where they deliver federal benefits blended into the heroin which is very appealing to a heroin track or because now you have a drug you can make justice strong at at a much lower price than heroin cost and then that is that important in the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to a kind of the ... ... says one of them may not have been solved that legislation\nSo probably the first thing to note is it what is not there which is there's not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sensible policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nA reimbursing the training of people who specialize in addiction having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens cover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point\nA supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in a jails and prisons because they're extremely high risk of overdose and so\nThere's going to be demonstration projects where there'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that together I think will lead up to saving some lives even though this is not a\nTransformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a message to the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug overdoses\nOh that would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcome that ad or being addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life and then their ability to you know hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their families so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to major the prevalence of new addiction in other words if we're providing healthcare properly it's not just a matter of people who are already addicted surviving we should stop creating as many addicted people as we have in prior years\nUp as a case I'm preserve drug policy expert at Stanford University and the United
