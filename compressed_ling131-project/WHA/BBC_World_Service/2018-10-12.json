I spent the question that everyone is wanting to know is ... century online now pointless and reproductive times can we get rid of the men and just rely on women in humans talking about a ... [laughter] yeah\nSo I think um one really important point to remember the U.S is that it took really extensive amounts of genetic modification in order to create this mass um and it was still by using the some of the most cutting each team next year I'm Will stone really inefficient privacy\nHundred and fifty kilometers fat hour and then went into Andhra Pradesh remember these two states have a combined population of Ninety million people\nIn ... when you spend a lot of damage but no debt unfortunately that's not the case and I'm Glad for that\nA concern that at the moment many of them fishermen and that was one of the big problems with the authorities were facing they evacuating three hundred thousand people in a recession\nBut when it came time their possession sending a message to the fishing and not to go out to sea lost many heeded that warning some didn't and unfortunately it's cost them their life\nIs there a sense of the authority weren't prepared an awful will do people feel them enough was done maybe but it's just unfortunate that the storm was too strong\nI think that's a contrast between the two weeks in Indian states that were hit by the Irish that hadn't zero casualty policy\nAnd they evacuated three hundred thousand people\nAnd while the huge damage with trees falling down communication for many positive they stayed in the risk of flooding now with heavy rain blocking the area I spoke to a senior official last night and he was happy he said because nobody had died and I think ... not that I'm Glad for that I think questions have to be asked that\nThe efficiency of the planning because eight people have died we use a hurricane was coming we know that nature has comes with such a force but I think more of a debate and under production about whether the authority should've been doing more to ensure that no fisherman where I could see\nHow big of a toss because we're going to be now to write some of the rooms get rid of the problems of the destruction of the storm was caused\nLosses store may have passed um you know the heavy rain is going to cause a lot of problems with the potential of flooding in many different areas remember this is a rural really calling me India most people survive on the land and if the land is ... badly damaged\nThat is going to have serious long term consequences but this is a part of India that is used to side plans they have them every single year and they do manage to recover I suppose I mentioned older all the anguish of people losing their lives and they're losing their property there's always a ray of hope and there are a number of stories in the papers this morning about women\nWho fall through the cycle and to get to hospitals had baby girls and they've all cold and ... so that we go that route tendon joining us allies that thank you very much indeed\nTo Liberia now where questions being asked about how Americans on trying to teach set up to provide an education bill ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused instead\nThe more than me educational charity was founded by an American woman Katie May she raised millions of dollars how much he can give a building for free by then Liberia's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf by twenty fourteen however a number of pills came forward alleging that they had been raped by organizations main coordinator Macintosh jumps and\nWell he went to prison and they died of aids but the fact that the ... he was still able to operate and lays more phones despite the scandal also angered people in Liberia one man he took up the story and a year long investigation it's been young he's behind the film and optical released yesterday by pope public and time I can see\nThe organization that war but we step up by American under a market it's basically student girls sexual exploitation but in the background or come to our about in the garden was exploited by any of the girls that what we were the interview was like well what are the girls are widespread was ... when ... died\nIn twenty succeed but what was the sort of stuff that was what was it\nNot Macintosh that you speak called these the the money for all the pet trade to the man who actually exploited and abused these young women he was a Liberian himself\nAnd he was one of the people instrumental in that and she needs finding bills for the school wasn't tea which in itself was quite amazing\nBut like a ghost junk on you or to find these wonderful girl ... or ... or ...\nHe describes himself as a former child soldier well I think that in the in the context of West point with the highly vulnerable girls all of a sudden you have any power he had multiplied as a consequence of the international they found it scholarships that I'm publicly they the more than the academy which\nWhich was really something that but when the news all over over Liberia\nHe managed to get to the east coast to the school with and then it was found out that he had been abusing them in this and they sell these quite central to this whole story because how was it discovered the first\nGirl came forward um in January of ... for the ... and that was for the schools are and the nurse who was also aware of the closeness between a John spin on ... you had to formally either relationship or could have affected\nHer she was perceived but she came she came forward with this news as a consequence there was a five month late and which according to police report we've all girls were right but then in ... there is there is in Iraq\nAnd more girls we can come forward and an end in ten girls press charges but according to a charge you talk to them as many as therapy when they\nSaid the young girls but it happened under the auspices of the challenge he reaches the base to be looking off do these go the charity we raised mainly in the money saying they are saving these girls from sanction exploitation giving them an education\nMultiple grow older car the but if you solve with big quakes and good luck thing on the first day going forward but also reflection of the fact that in Liberia badly the resources are are often below\nThat if someone is able to access to resources like Milo was able to weather or through quite typical campaign but they sure are left are like more traditional bonus I think that when someone is able to accept the money and provide services there can be not shoot up well OK it might not be perfect but maybe it's the best we're going to get\nYou think the question some me I'll give him a on skis well why would they still allowed to operate by the government when this whole scandal came to light and he was found that dozens of dumbbells um\nAt least ten of them than he could be more ... to ... some actually um well it may take then by this man named ... by him and had to jump out to school why did they were still allowed to operate\nI think it's challenging I think that because anytime there's abuse there's always a community was always on a neighboring element from the people who either you or shooting on those who are benefiting and and then didn't take the steps to safeguard those who are more vulnerable but one of the girls to report on march ... story\nWhen ... when he spoke to her she had she probably should have been abandoned by the organization and this was a girl that at a very hard life\nOne of the girls who had gone through all of this must be brave enough to testify\nThat that she regretted testifying because she'd been told by the organization but she did everything would be fine by the end she felt she was little I think the key thing to remember an officer thought that was probably about ... ... more than the resources to West Point\nThat weren't coming otherwise they were an organization that respect I help over the period of it was all those who struggled but most ... even those who perhaps felt they were treated badly or they were white there's a there was a fear that well my story by telling my story\nI could lose what ... what looked like and given by this organization that I Would also comes up is going to step up\nAnd he was one of those behind the film who'd unprotected he did that change the more than ... nation is actually she just stayed in the nineties not sounds\nYeah they say more than me exist to support children with safety health and education we're horrified to the girls enjoyed this obesity ketamine\nGoes on in June of twenty fourteen ten brave girl named jumps and as they were abused both at the academy and in that community we believe that more than me posted an environment\nAs soon as the first case was reported to senior stuff we acted swiftly and decisively we cooperated with Liberian national police Liberian\nSexual gender base voters crime units the ministry of justice to collect evidence to complete the jumps in prison he was arrested just four days of the senior software notes as part of his criminal acts\nAnd it goes on to say or what would they don't yet know the full text of ProPublica ... video here's what we know so far we are deeply sorry when we started this what we believe that our energy and passion for improving goes lives was enough to create lasting change\nWe ambitious but also naive statements from ... says\nOne of the newspapers this morning in Liberia exclude from page ... page story a serial

so\nYou know from ... is a is an expression of almost trust that Switzerland might do something to help him find this money and you know Switzerland is not as bad as it used to be but let's face it it's not as good as it could be so if I were a wealthy Nigerian and not hit and you know a few hundred million dollars in Switzerland I wouldn't be worrying too much\nI mean they said and then in

the investigation and food will\nBasically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it and it was no one in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape\nBut but really no one has ever gone deep and to really find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened it was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nThat the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls the rents care\nSo when the rates came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their press statement\nThat this was a community issue according to our investigation and minimize the role of the men who had been a central ... who died an intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't powered by giving him the power to educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school\nAnd then when it came to light you had been ripping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations owned and operated and cultures and a challenging context may have contributed to his ability to access to abused young girl they mind ended up in\nThe trial ended in how Judy and what our investigation reveals is that when he died it it's\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there are many other students who had been named as also has a victim so while the organization took steps to make sure that the ten girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named essence victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate generally there'll be many changes at all to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought\nTo to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two girls were the first time according to their statements that the police so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in the six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak Liberia at that time and\nThe organizations founder and the organization of world where courted very strongly by international press subsequently gave him either who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six

are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American by nationality right now hurricane Michael

restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is both lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLawrence is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause death and equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase to the next to see the price of things that you can't another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no ... says what do we can face that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term law office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other is simple we also know that the fossil fuel industries\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a harder time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nUh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get the short\nTerm ... cases I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the terms of ... increase in the months of renewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar\nSupport for WPRI comes from you W credit union providing financial consultants who are dedicated to helping members plan for retirement with options like IRAs more at you WC you dot org your best interest always comes first\nAgreement incredibly effective used greens working on European policy so you know for example like with the sustainable finance area we can say the ... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with the one point five Paris target for example I can see that and I'm In the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they mentioned the world that is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how a manageable and how difficult it will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou you just want to us today is that when asking the question who is going to pay to for\nThis one really should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual project wants\nTo just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question was going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today\nThey're projected to boost increased significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far future does this um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed to adopt the shield the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie\nWants to come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and\nThanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he is making it easier reason to global carbon price for instance it's a great no but do is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient\nSolution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had\nIs domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's this investment changing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough\nAh as they say the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made also in the report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not heard it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons\nI guess only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYou know so when we talk about coffee is important but we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three big trends are going to happen\nRegardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty says to him down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double nine the Chilean will be invested in New in for\nGets sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant\nPlaces debate not productive or we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how

didn't actually except the science\nThat's hit from Myron evil he ... think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Mondays I PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would be swayed the administration that it needs to take this little seriously [noise]\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't as bad last\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they use the science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science would they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBubbled wants to come in and bring you in\nThe United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern to it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide gate and of course that is true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you go to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nAppeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've\nBeen having here it is appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people of our jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them forward or it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big because at sea level rise is a good chance the warmer than our fridge Walters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments that three\nThousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies\nAre are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... the he's a professor of environment and develop and in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo joy to I Want to about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also the country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly serious the just described to us some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda is much more to talk about renewables\nBut at the same time you just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to develop and so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but smuggling fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if it would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have he would savings in help\nAnd so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus will do and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost\nIndian governments have ... that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't paucity industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat in Nineteen Ninety\nI'm the developing countries are doing the milk must take action cyst not it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to save it going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to buy bonds\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the old tried to convince off ancient funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I found a very good idea shifting the problem is that great and so I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bite off that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic destruction do you think\nFor a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\nOf a democracy is of course is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to the physicians relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other\nHand I think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if you can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains starts to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd so I've consequences if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the postal sect in India they will really suffer and there's a strong reason to take their views into account and try to read visit our energy storyline ...\nSo there's a big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons for China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not democratic\n[noise] China's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time said ones but I think\nAny kind of well run and country any kind of country that has a government that cares about its population will in fact be pushed by that population if I population as well

they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charge he will still able to operate agrees more funds despite the scandal and the people in Liberia now one month took up the story you know your long investigation on his name is ...\nYoung he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by pro public and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier\nIt was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and he was the one who was on the ground and girls often and managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements that police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... again\n... girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts talk\nYou know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh on one of the interesting things about it is that it was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care or so when the rates came to light\nThe organization essentially said that this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mountain organization who doesn't intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had in ... and then they simply said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own\nOperating cultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access and abused young girl\nThe trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died at age\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named essence victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront them for weight\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate to generally there'll be many changes uh told to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and so to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually there it's been reported in which time\nTwo girls were the first time according to their statements that the police so definitely they organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the

G disappeared off during the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on an administrative era and\nNo one knows what happened to him Turkish officials voice lurid suspicions about murder or abduction which have been hotly denied in Riyadh\nWhat is clear is that the disturbing case of democracy ... has raised why are the questions about what is happening in Saudi Arabia to pay NBS the self proclaimed reform of the conservative kingdom\nHas turned to ruthless repression\nWhy well I'm joined by Saudi academic my ... Rashid and former senior U.S diplomat Nicholas Burns who is now a professor at the JFK school of government at Harvard University\nWe must begin with ... he hasn't been seen since he won't into that Saudi comes she lived in Istanbul more than a week ago we do not know what has happened to him but how disturbed are you by the details of this case\nI'm very distressed and also worried about the hundreds of how the dissidents and activists who have taken refuge in the west from Canada the United States Britain\nAnd many other countries especially attacking the situation has become extremely difficult for critics and peaceful protesters the feminist movement in Saudi Arabia\nAnd said November two thousand Seventeen almost one thousand five hundred people as well detained according to um have met the sandman himself\nBut this attack political crime I Would call it is ashes seen little warning and shocking\nIs typical the gold it a crime while we still truly do not know what has happened but Nick burns your inexperience diplomat you served as a\nAs a U.S ambassador to use a long years inside the state department I mean just how flagrant violation would it be if we went to pursue the line of speculation and believe the reports from Turkish sources but something something very bad happened to Mr ... G inside that comes Sheila building\nWealth David if if the reports are true and there's a lot of coming out of turkey this morning as you've seen 'em this would be murder it'd be murder by the government of Saudi Arabia against one of its citizens\nMr ... is also a permanent resident of the United states of the state of Virginia He's a columnist for one of our most prominent newspapers the Washington Post\nSo from an American perspective there's a direct interest of the United states government in trying to pressure the Saudi Government to tell the truth of what happened\nThat denials by the Saudi ambassador to the United states cannot be belief at this point and the Saudi Government has not offered any convincing evidence as to what happened and so I think that pressure from all world leaders including from the Turkish president has to continue on the Saudi Government\nLet's return Nick burns if we made to NBS himself and it is important again to think from Washington's point of view that for a long time indeed the years that you are a very senior figure in the state department there was deep concern\nAbout the degree to which Saudi Arabia was exporting or a ... hobby religious ideology which was\nEncouraging dangerous extremism and many other parts of the world where Saudi resources were being invested in mosques and ma dresses and what have you\nAnd NBS addressed all of this and he said to Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing and with continuous progress in old elements\nAnd he asked you said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to pay in that area\nIt's better than ... paying a very big debt\nTo make that move now surely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been in the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen Seventy to the Iranian Revolution\nThe Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but Israel now enjoys the best relationship\nPolitical foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had and so you're saying the substantial changes under Mohammed bin Salman but at the same time Steven I think that there's growing impatience and now outright anger in both of our political parties in Washington and inside the Trump Administration over what appears to be\nAn entirely reckless inhumane\nBased teal act by the Saudi Government to kill one of his own critics you couple that with the the problem with the Saudis have caused and the ... by prosecuting this ill considered very violent war against civilians in Yemen with American weapons I think in the United states we're on the verge of a major debate\nAt the Saudis can't develop a convincing narrative of what happened to Mr ... show he I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nAre interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the fingers in the last year to American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia where some a teen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more ... and vote for any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... balls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides but I Am skeptical as to whether your belief\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia is really going to happen\nOur relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment ever on\nBut I Do think two things may happen one is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from ... that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and I cannot be that's going to be a problem for mama been solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia about his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening\nA Saturday influence around the world or weaken it that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed\nBy the use of American weapons by the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas it's been a tremendous loss of life there have been cholera outbreaks it's a great humanitarian crisis\nAnd I don't know how long the Trump Administration is going to be able to justify\nThe transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia for that war which has been so destabilizing on the Arabian Peninsula my Dolly\nThe sheep we have talks at some length about the number of prisoners that MBA ice is locked up for this and I think you figure in the thousands\nIncluded in that number at least for a while with some very senior members of the family and close associates of the family some of whom were famously locked up in the rich Carlton and including a well he'd been to ... one of Saudi Arabia's biggest businessman Nicholas Burns\nOff and interesting questions about just how secure NBS his grip on power is what are you saying well\nSecure a crown prince who had already guaranteed that who get it'd be the future of king of Saudi Arabia would not actually behave in the way we have not been said man had behaved especially at towards his own cousins\nIn addition to the ... there was an important ... the head of the national guard in Saudi Arabia he had a military base and warm security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the art installations but if it hadn't been ten men as secure and his position he wouldn't a result to these kinds of erratic acts\nThe war in Yemen it's been going on for almost like four years and we have seen no end to the bombing using less than a ministry equipment\nAnd also expect tease let's not forget that are people from the United states and from the ministry in Britain on the ground in Saudi Arabia and we have heard that without us and you can support that this war in Yemen with not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame that war in the way the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between Saudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians\nA framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been shown that ground it has supported as growth and Lebanon and Iraq and Syria and elsewhere\nBut the argument that we can tolerate it added pressure regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister like the prime minister of Lebanon and puts him under house arrest for him to resign to destabilize yet another country in the Mid East\nAnd press if he takes probably another immigration and ... and a few genes crisis\nTo go that far without actually they us\nSupport for WPRI comes from the terrible university with the db Reinhardt Institute for ethics and leadership working to build communities up servant leaders who are dedicated to the common good more is that the turbo dot edu\nWell today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country I'm be actors just started three years old it controls pretty much all leave us a power as far as we can tell and Saudi Arabia remains a boss the wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other to the the strategic balance\nIn the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt instability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia state I think we're looking at\nAlmost a Shakespearian drama here\nYou can see the promise of reform\nAnd the acts of reform or by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side you see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other studies\nAnd and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turn\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those countries around the world that have close relations with the kingdom you've been hoping for some sort of change in Saudi Arabia for a long time do you see this is a watershed\nMoment not under the leadership of time I'd been settled on it I I've lost hope that there is hope for reform in Saudi Arabia simply because we have heard the story of reform for several decades and that the more it's reforms the more it stays the same and in fact we are food west scenarios\nBut we our sheet here in London and the buttons in California I think you both very much for

story ... is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the meat you in the most important institutions that go up the economy you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that plane leave the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was brought on us by the political and financial establishment and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people were left behind in those responsible was\nFinally start quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's in it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that\nIs behaving well anyway\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an on preparedness to believe actual empirical facts lots of that's possibly does come from the rise of social meat yet but there is\nA sense now that there's no particular reason to believe the established means you're over ... stood in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that somebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more to be trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience at the time didn't you when the moon brothers collapsed is actually that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the tea\nYes I have this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis I was two blocks away from the human side of it it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a lot of money just landed in ways to keep writing comics I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left him uninsured deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me wondering the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible protected by the governments and Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people and\nIt's not suits trying to a shovel their money around to protect it\nNow that looked like a bank run technically wasn't it was actually taking their money out at the right but it looks like a bank run\nAnd if we hits trying to publicizing this it would've been a very scary\nAll I was thinking was if we publicize an image like this than we are going to get into trouble because this is going to look irresponsible it's going to look for somewhere in fighting panic\nOn crumb basically inciting a bank run\nYes exactly which is one of the things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can gets into trouble if there's a lot of confidence in it you got to be really really sure of\nWhat you're doing before you say that there's a bank ... said just make it you didn't report it at the time I did not report that the time it didn't particularly series they picked me to say\nI'm ten years on because we've had the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting anecdote to talk about an ... by the sheer level of invective and the anger vis a rose the opinion against them as you know at least for two one five to one against\nVery powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nSo people saw it as you withholding crucial information that they should have had access to if you being in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media sources like the F T where I was ... times acting\nAs a responsible filter of being your reliable source that you can go to for information is out to face at this point I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taking a ... and it would have been out there on social media and that is most now regarded as ... as a baseline of acceptable behavior\nJust not just the two thousand eight financial crisis but it also social media that is created this lack of trust and\n... there was a loss of belief in the financial establishment combined with the loss of belief in conventional media these days information gathering is tribal people read the information they're interested in in the\nRegion so see if they don't care about and when you put the two together what you find is that if a great\nAnd wonderful traditional news source does a great piece of investigative reporting it can still cheerfully be dismissed because there is a sense that everything's through the financial world is corrupt anyway and you don't need to trust traditional media to tell you things are\nKind of makes you wonder what would it take to budge someone's opinion on President Trump I mean is something as big as a serious allegation in a big globally recognized needs to have a lot in New York Times saying a sitting president is effectively\nA tax cheats that's the implication of the newspaper whatever denials era\nIf that makes no impact what would\nI find it very hard to imagine there's I mean he made the famous comments about shooting somebody in Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him he was kind of right and yes\nIt's hard to see what's what's changed your opinion at this moment ... ... ... vets opinion is so polarized and people derive their information\nFrom particular associates I remember I sense out of tweets Donald Trump is delighted to tell everybody I wanted to play stock market performances so since that's sweet simply comparing how he had done compared to under Obama and Clinton and it's a done veteran drawing grammar and things and then under Trump [noise]\nAnd I go to a bunch of replies say where did you get that from was that from MSNBC\nWhich is the most liberal cable news channel here and see her and say I mean yes yes so you can send a basic straightforward factual information about how much a stock markets as resumes and it will still be treated as I ... you go that's from somebody liberal\nFactual ... but it also suggestive of a sort of new lives and\nIt's very difficult to talk about this in ways that are very very mixed it but it was a lack of trust\nTrust is very difficult for these functions very difficult for five minutes for folks and there was a lack of preparedness to believe anything that you don't already believe ultra trust others to work in all of U.S interests it's very dangerous\nJohn ... of Bloomberg of course the real test for President Trump will come in November when the U.S holds midterm elections\nBut wow there'd be no immediate political repercussions since the New York times published its allegations against him this month the New York state tax department has confirmed it is looking into the claims and New York city officials have said they've joined the investigation to ... is a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush\nThe big issue is that this is a state and local level investigation and the president has no power to pardon at state and local level it's the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan prosecutor her going after the Trump entities in New York\nAnd at that level he cannot do anything so if he really is facing a serious investigation there he's going to need cash\nAnd so that's why I think there is a very good chance that he won't run again because what he really needs and wants to do is to launch what they're calling T. N. N. which has the Trump voters network to take on C. N.

they've been coming up more bad news on antibiotic resistance commonly used herbicides weed killers\nRapidly speed up the process of bacterial resistance according to the latest research\nWhich we will hear a little later on before that will go straight to Istanbul to quote the is resuming the case of the American pasta Andrew Brunson mocked low and joins us from Istanbul or he's been in jail for two years on charges of supporting terrorism or what might happen today\nThere is an expectation cautious optimism I think from the Americans stand that a pastor Brunson might be released today there were reports late last night on NBC News ... that they had gotten\nA of a secret deal that had been struck between the American antitrust governments to release pasta Brunson by sentencing him to time already spent hit in\nDetention remember this is the case that has led us turkey relations to plummet\nI'm Donald Trump lost patience with the fact that he was still intention here over the summer two years after he was and she looked up at that led to sanctions on two Turkish ministers and um the White House announcing a trade tariffs ... ah on Pakistan I'm not a million would be doubled\nEncore reciprocated and so a U.S tech relations plummeted and with it\nThe Turkish lira that's lost forty percent of its value against the dollar this year so if he is a released there was an

well to update from London [noise]\n\n\nThis is Dan Damon with wild updates there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics and the other years of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of besides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them in from the University of cancer brand new Zealand after most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of this is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria\nBut the chemistry of these different kinds of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the time the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you'll get a sub lethal effect bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that removed\nSo do outside that pre adapts to bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so the herbicides in a sense are vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... thanks loans where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together and these places because for example you might use herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn what back into someone's house where there's stroked that puts herbal I'd an application levels on their hands and they may touched them out\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria in these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to some leads the levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us and to\nPossibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemicals\nCan you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\nProfessor jak kind them in more than a million people were killed during eight years of fighting between Iran and Iraq a war that
