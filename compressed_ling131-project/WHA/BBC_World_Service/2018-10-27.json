S. it's Christopher Blair he's been described as one of the most prolific writers effect and Belgium Martin shank fact checker who's made it his job to expose the fix\nThe ten fake news had the mainstream in a very political way which is something of a problem\nBecause now it's used as a weapon to bash not just completely false things made up by 'cause the ... the conspiracy theories misinformation spin mistakes opinion an even completely truthful reports that people just don't like\nSony so let's be very clear here we're taking the politics of it we're looking at the original meaning of fake news completely made up stuff the stories that Christopher Blair rights and Martin shrink to bunks they have absolutely no basis in fact\nRight but despite those being false ... maybe because of being false they have a huge pale they get people to click\nThat we had any uh how ... was making a substantial amounts of money from watching fake news so much so that he was able to give up his day job and do it for a living that's one side of fake news that we know is lucrative\nFor what I Want to find out if it was the same for the truth hunters just check his make the same kind of money\nSo about a half of my income right now comes from running through the lives of the lead story has left say are you able to have those in euros books or just the person because of that comes from a the advertising that I make only stories\nNeed stories it's a fact checking website that molten cofounded it's essentially a blog and he makes money the same way fate nice twice just make it by appetizing\n\nNow mine anyway I mentioned ...

Facebook page they won't make it to any of his website to see any of these disclaimer as many won't even click a link if they see it on their own Facebook feed\nWhat they'll do is they'll just share the headline and from this perspective histories don't look any different from any other fake stories that are out there\nAnd he is the second like CrossFit that justifies rushing often offensive fate nice he says he's actually a true Democrat liberal a holiday\nOn what's known as a liberal troll\nMy purpose online is to\nExpose the modern American conservative\nHe says he's staying as associates infiltration of right wing ... to make conservatives look stupid okay you better explain that I Know it sounds weird but he's very open about the fact that he writes isn't true precisely because Christopher says this demonstrates that people have taken Sherrod\nWho are by and large are right wing Republican Trump supporters\nYep sit plus just says this demonstrates that thing out Steve head or evil or malicious\n[noise]\n\nSo any say in the timeline of the story of fake news we've got to about two years ago right wrist for players making money writing fake stuff Martin shank is making considerably less money Dunkin' Donuts but after the U.S election is suddenly a huge outpouring of attention on so called fake news\nAnd it's not long before the business model of fake news comes crashing down\nOh I'm absolutely the bad guy on the boat in Maryland for many people are always will be I've accepted that the one thing that I enjoy about it now is it always says that I did it for the money there early Monday morning at six months go with my patients active I'm Still doing it I'm ...

to follow up for the me too era Hollywood needs no reminding of goes to the allegations faced by film producer Harvey Weinstein allegations he denies\nThe BBC's Moffat county has been discussing these issues with Jane Fonda she began by\nAsking how she first got the idea for the film nine to five which also start Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton\nOne of my friends was an organizer of women office workers she would tell me stories about the kinds of things that they were facing is that they had to put up with and finally one day I said I Want to make a movie about this and then was my idea to cast ...\nHow much convincing did they take a year\nConvince ... to be in a movie which is pretty amazing given that nobody ever had Dolly in a movie before looking back on the film do you think it stood the test of time absolutely the issue with me too movement which began just about a year ago is very much front and center and of course nine to five very much dealt with the issues of\nSexual abuse but not just that also the fact that uh the character played by Lily Tomlin would train young men and they would be promoted past her and\nOf material when it comes to making a seat for which you looking into it\nYeah well it's different now in a way it's worse the sexual harassment still exist\nThe men being promoted past women still exist but now many of the workers will be\nSubcontracted which means that where do they go when their wages stolen by their boss where did they go with their fired because they're pregnant so we need a new movie whether the script will turn out I don't know I hate to get my hopes up too much\nAnd when in the wake of Harvey Weinstein in the allegations that came out about him did that present personal dynamic is for you about whether to speak out on\nThose no I've never had too many difficulties speaking out\nWhat was important for me me too was the survivor is coming forward and telling their stories and being believed\nThe time's up movement is now what do we go to do about it like having more women on boards of directors having women and more positions of power but right at the beginning of time's up we in Hollywood received a\nA wonderful letter from seven hundred thousand women farm workers you know it was really dear sisters we understand what you were talking about and rising up about we deal with it every day in the fields\nAnd it was a transformative moment and a lot of us realize that if the time's up movement is going to be successful in the long run we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters that are less visible if it's even harder for them to speak up because they will definitely lose their jobs\nI had read that do you yourself have known some of the allegations about ... cat but haven't spoken out so\nWell no you can't it's the survivor that has to speak because this was before it became public that Rosanna told me her experience and\nThe experience of other women as well and but she was too scared to come forward but she knew that it had affected her career that she had rebuffed him\nBut I I couldn't override her and speak\nDo you think that the whole controversy around ... ... and his appointment as the Supreme Court justice do you think that that can be seen in the context of the me too movement in the sense that Christine Blasey Ford herself was willing to come forward and speak about it\nWell Anita Hill came forward and spoke about it before there was a me too movement in fact African American women have been coming forward and speaking about this long before white famous white women in Hollywood have been doing so but I think\nThe behavior of the old white men on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd how they were too scared to question her blessing for directly for fear of appearing away Joe Biden and others who questioned during the Clarence Thomas hearings so they hired a woman lawyer\nTo do it you know that's a cop out we're cowards\nThat is because of me too they knew they had to be a very very careful\nAnd so they were careful for a while and then of course Trump insulted her and ... told her and then people followed suit and what

it's it's a big problem the problem of course is that the every time a migrant successfully comes to the U.S it encourages others and there is of course are limited to to all the U.S could take the problem is that the Central American and southern American regions\nIs a suffered for decades she was the Cold War of instability or which was partly um induced a bike through crime and other means to counter I'm a Soviet intervention in that area\nAnd and now we have the the the outcome of decades old um destabilization policies will on people that want the best life um and I think there are

there's that fear is that in the on the horizon\nThat's become that that border that says but what happens there because everything is leading up to that has the crescendo of of people supporting each other right the way to the last moment what happens then I I I just like my heart sank when I heard\nThat the gentleman saying that that he expected to to be able to impact on Trump's heart and I do fear I really do fear of what's going to happen when they get there\nBecause of the timing do you think is it all about these midterm election\nI think that's certainly a win for churches to some regards but of course part of the problems and the other is that this is a very key political moment [laughter] but but it's also the fact that the rhetoric that that Trump and his administration have had this far\nReally does mean that this is not something that really they know is going to go away quietly so whenever I think this had occurred it would've been an issue for the administration but

I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to

of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts him dependence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity that demand

techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of the sciences and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things more sorry fly into things where you got these machines that looked like washing machines with fans in the midst of carbon out of the year\nThey shouldn't do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we thinking about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they've philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove come through why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaign has environmental is really worried about because people think there's gonna be a solution to used on the truck they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo what extent is common capture happening all ready and how can you make it

changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something that we can't break would be the bigger more technical industrial challenge of you know focusing on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few and practices and it's really a handful around the world and the big problem with that course all these big bits of kiss cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report that come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands Neal to see if you can protect those they're an amazing source of our sing for common they soak up more common than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton per common and that is really really cheap the bigger problem of course a lot of times we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the games are making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller think is happening and it's cheap and not just reporters things we do more than how to you\nIncentivize countries such as China countries such as India which would be an industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture yeah\nBoth China and India are taking all these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that also obviously building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief among the richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it then there will be able to either share that technology but Indian China\nNothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all the the big challenges with China and India they remain on
