World Service for Steven soccer Afghanistan just held its the parliamentary election since the Taliban regime was toppled in two thousand and one\nThe poll expires oil they recovering problems of insecurity the dome the country in the years since dozens of security personnel were killed hundreds were wounded and in some areas voting simply didn't happen as the Taliban attempted to ... Afghans away from polling stations\nNonetheless millions didn't turn out on results will be declared next month\nThe government of president Ashraf Ghani is likely to hail approach that says evidence of progress on the road to stability\nBut beyond the rhetoric want as reality look like the Taliban operate with impunity in waves of territory the national security forces are short haul numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my guest is President Ghani has recently appointed national security advisor how ... easy formally Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat with little previous security experience based the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country\nWell having a dilemma have joins me now on the line from Kabul\nHave to be here\nWe speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you a shame that the\nWay those elections works out with so many Afghans\nAre facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and the lack of government control of key parts of your territory they Bruce Lee exposed ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the Afghan people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end is F\nA I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle that bravery for one second but here's the reality of your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country\nDidn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar and the guy's name\nA that was no voting because of security concerns of course there may be some more voting next week we're not quite sure we know that your own a transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were are open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy's a plus the thousands killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling stations one has to conclude\nMe personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint and I'm dedicated me and the and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nI issued a statement to our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed death\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and ... that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful law mindful of something that I mean ... former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in may so particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he says the navy so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life\nAnd know gains because our country is not secure he says that of NATO's operation something called\nThe operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from Nathan forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold waltz because this is all you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see t._v. there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news\nA space for the fun it's fun and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is that transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war\nOur aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies or to help us along that way\nAnd know that your investments in this country has not gone to waste\nYes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a ... it takes more now than just\nUh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks tourism support who are being helping any quid painting painting our security right is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan ah let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand all them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing mood in America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we showed a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism a and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan and why is that on my ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks were taking place at the time we told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the piece in reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we also had the initiative on the ceasefire where\nWell until you start because we have now I don't think it'll stay straight down said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote\nFills that I had these meetings with\nUh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... ... talk he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one can formation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it it was a quick meeting a and a ... she didn't know he has to be very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then you I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban and it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided\nThat far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seem to be saying no we're\nOur selves no you you cannot um have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do\nOwn and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor a success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process why on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground and many pounds of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMissed the national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right towards stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell well the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats they participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then\nThey must come and content and see where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in a in a democratic process and let the African people\nChoose ... we have to end it there but I Do thank you very much for joining me on hotdog\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk may 'cause\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over

dissolves with repeat to use\n'em so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ban on plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's a welcome development and I'd also like to look not just a single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's been the oceans as well\nSo I was really struck by the high proportion of plastic and in the oceans that's due to fishing I think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is from that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um\nClean up as well as prevention\nMatthew and oh this is an issue close to your heart's it's a civil liberties issue I think is is won't stop boils down to the Peter Morici interview that people should be free to the environment if they want\n[noise] ... well ... and I guess every time we come from the supermarket Laden with a huge pile of plastic packaging we're making our own contribution to that so I think for those of us who are extremely concerned about this issue it's actually very refreshing to hear\nA political the politicians are an on any political institutions in Europe taking strong action on this\nUm but that seems sort of a ground breaking it will will quite yeah it is it's it's a directive it say she's not yet nor of course but hopefully it will lead to legislation which will force industry to change 'em but there's also things we can do as well I don't know if you've come across each her brakes\nThese incredible innovation that's being used plastic both yeah that's right it's it's they're being used in South Africa or in parts of Southeast Asia or\nEssentially you take a plastic ball for Rothman farming in a way you fill it up very you you you you pocket very densely with all the pieces of plastic\nUh ways that you would normally have just shocked and the pain and gradually you get a very solid piece of building material it if you can get it to the right place can be used to create a structure that's going to stand there for a thousand years so I was like we need to do a feature on [laughter] yeah that's an idea [laughter] that's a that's an idea but\nBut yeah I mean it's a way to sequester the plastic take it out of the environment

[noise]\nIt's kind of a fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like it or not we want to replicate our our genes Chitra [noise]\nYes I mean we've touched on this slightly ... I Want to explore more and we don't want to read about what sex robots would mean for human sexuality particularly given that that as we mentioned already designed by men woman says Gen did straight men\nWhat are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes around agency consent and lights\nAnd and also a link to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography they're up to kill the racial stereotypes um that uh a ... foot and pornography as well\nAnd I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I slept ... ideas Kate\nThat's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a male straight while I'm ...\nI'm a last word has her normative so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and um the church and in this case um it's a it's a month and a woman and it's it's a sex evils me to suffer China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today all tend to be in this um\nSalmon ice hyper sexual form and they all tend to be white as well um\nSkin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized\nUm this is problematic and and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these um just to check\nOut our we act the technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitates a ... not ... the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots with some of them is how sexy can they possibly be most people it's kind of being nice and I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time\nBut we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these they I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly there's also official intelligence as hyper realistic veal I mean the\n... or at least a robot can talk to you convince me not so they so they these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] and then throw\nThese robots have personalities that are being developed you can carry around just download an app on your phone or tablets you have a virtual girlfriend than your phone they're working on a meal version as well partly um so I think that that's probably a more realistic it convincing human than any rowboat\nWhat's being reception for your book case so sorry to interrupt quick point I was going to\nSay just hearing you Kate makes me I'm wonder why people need but she'll go for it\nAnd whether it is is this does it say something about but apparently he got boyfriends and girlfriends ... let me let's be honest it's not boyfriends at such a good friends that were talking about and does it say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll Gulf and who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and thought\nBecause I don't know how ... yeah I think that's there's probably less and I think ... sort of the talks looking at the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers those so we of course you know we're able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps\nMen have more problems without dabbling author of turned on south science six on Robles many thanks for coming on the program big thanks to August should turn I cannot garage in Lagos Matthew Green here in London Thanks to you for listening and joined the rest of your weekend by by for now\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
