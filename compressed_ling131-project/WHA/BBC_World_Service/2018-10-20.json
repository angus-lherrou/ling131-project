World Service number if you'd like the program and would like to hear some more of our recent shows they're available as podcasts wherever you get your podcasts from\nRussia and videos that according to a European Union website was in fact a piece of propaganda staged by the ...\nBetter now check one two Oh yes a lot better I lost your daughter that's just Russell you had that testing the

here right playing video games at night and if you don't have TV it's sort of what I usually do and uh at the current moment I'm into hunting down these Russian trolls\nAnd just to be clear he does each totally for free as far as we know he's not on the payroll full any security or intelligence agency that's Jesse ... he goes out of his way to identify social media accounts that are deliberately and openly staring arguments on line\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic work that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing\nA Josh has a background in programming and I T he understands social media and he knows the mind a patrol because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nA rumor or\nHaving followed dozens of Russian troll accounts having studied that behaves yet ... isn't a great position to tell us wanting to mission wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits it is almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again\nThey're going to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is\nThat Dr molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly\nHe's a big star wars fan [noise]\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices\nYou seat never before I had a star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse actors playing prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening at the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was\nMolten got curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Bryan Johnson\nSome of them except the behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\n... have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start caring free weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society sick the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... all rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating the spaces and setting up the volume as you well if those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it\nOkay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level\nFrom the moments to vie do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative it's only bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided if you're sympathetic to on this point uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that's a rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control on the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias\nThen divvied you will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of the senseless political correctness brigade inaction [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we conclusively say that ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggesting\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode suddenly fits into a broader pattern one very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's D.C information campaign\nIt this week for BBC trending I'm like ... and

my experience is\nThat the victims outside of it they are silenced by the term than they are silenced by history because the Palestinian story was never hurt because there was another story which was covering it\nAnd for the world which means Europe the other story was bigger because it was outta for made that story that does the articles was done by Europeans and so the whole book is a dialogue

think one of the things that he's trying to do it as he says he's trying to give voice to the victims that are written out of history and I think that that uh the world over the world after and I

line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it to open to be among the first customers of legal candidates in the country\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years\nAnd you know others said they never thought they'd be something like this in the lifetime so when the store opened a cat in the morning first customers walk in you know a big cheer corrupted and throughout the day as people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of of that day that legalization dang Canada\nCanada close is the second country all the euro glide to to legalize cannabis legalize why this decision well the reasoning by the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian youth miners teenagers and so on\nSo they said look we're going to try and bring in this new strict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective is the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce it some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a licensed producer\nAnd possess thirty grams\nOf the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork he said in some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example has most populous province you can use it essentially the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes he would use tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market to possess over thirty grams\nThere actually some new infractions around selling minors which carry a charge of up to fourteen years in prison now of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development all day\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there is a growing body of evidence that there was a risk of using the drug\nAbout the development of the fetus so again both organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we were hearing a lot about a green lush about the possible boon to the economy that this development could have water people thinking about that\nIn the months up to legalization here in Canada I mean one of the headlines you saw almost every day it was just talking about the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea Canada statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spent rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on candidates\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it said it's among supposed to do it all the countries will be watching very closely with they absolutely ... and\nAcross the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government is able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously\nOther countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out\nI was Jessica Buffy in Canada and
