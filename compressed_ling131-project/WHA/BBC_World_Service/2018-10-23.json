R. T. V.\nAnd that in addition to what we call multi drug resistant tuberculosis it's one of the top five countries in the world and so they had a difficult time in treating patients\nUsing Jacqueline they were able to find that these very very difficult patients that they were able to actually have an extremely good success rate of Ninety three percent is one of the two new drugs that we have for tuberculosis\nIn the last fifty years so um this is a ... is a big breakthrough but it points out the need for more\nKinds of drugs like this and it's important because with tuberculosis you cannot treat with just one drug you must have at least to effective drugs so just just developing one and and just giving that alone is going to cause resistance to that particular drug\n... since about the only way to beat the book you know it's just to have one drop and combined with the others who does that mean he was simply a case of mixing across south for getting the right way and then eventually you know get bingo you've done it\nRight now since we only have two new drugs that means that you do have to combine them with the drugs that we already know about and uh but that's not going to be good enough pretty soon you're going to need additional new medications in order to get to the to the bottom of treating tuberculosis in all its forms\nWhy is the book you know it's just so from each point of view so successful\nTuberculosis is successful it's it's an organism that can live in your body in a dorm at fashion you can live there for years maybe never even develop if your immune system is healthy you may never even actually develop the actual disease it'll just like dormant in your body\nAnd some ... and then other times if your immune system is weak for example when you had HIV when you have diabetes or in other conditions that where your immune system goes down certain cancers like kidney disease that can actually make the organism\nCome alive again to actually develop to actually develop the disease of tuberculosis\nAnd tuberculosis is spreading to the rich countries is correct\nI think that a tuberculosis is a disease of low and middle income countries in countries like the United states the the the numbers and the rates are very low but there is something very interesting that's going on in especially the middle income countries like South Africa China India\nNeeded the countries that have some of the highest burdens of tuberculosis\nThere now middle income countries they're rich country they're becoming richer and with that becomes better nutrition and in some cases a lot of obesity why is that important because obesity is linked to diabetes and diabetes is linked to tuberculosis because if you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher\nDid not know that sort of pulled up food you are from the international union against ... some lung disease saying that about new combination of drugs successfully treat them with them on to say ... percent of patients who have\nShe says [noise]\nFar just as much as ... film directors impulses critically acclaimed film sugar came all the rules for me\nIt's about a young boy ... a piece called five growing up on a sugar cane fields of but you make of it on to thirties or the film put the country in the wall of a ... as a leading female filmmaker about the movie has been digitized of using the largest military is being\nReleased for a new orders palsy blazed with many trails in a long career including\nBeing the false block female director of a Hollywood movie just been speaking to news days she'll be shocked\nI used to go to the theater or is it time but you know in ... but it was a dream and nobody believed you need that that was because he was because there was no was the scene maker in the in the island so I went to Paris\nI study Shannon's I asked to do you need to have shot someone uh I ...

professor ... blue ... who is ... with puff scientific advisor and in your own adjust\nThe essence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called automatic pilot\nIs defective people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it Dutch automatic ability is lost and people with Parkinson's but you can actually do the trick the brain by by policy that automatic pilot which is more or less just\nBart consciously recruiting the motor areas of the brain so what the losers basically do is offer an external visual trigger forcing or allowing to patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they ... they are defective ultra magic parted\nRight okay I think I get that for people that have Parkinson's the will to my way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way\nOr another really good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues will care style as\nDust because the styles going up woods acts as a visual cue or obstruction by ... to ... the sensory illusion of the lasers walks in the same way it tricks the brain by constantly placing a cue\nAnd from out who I was we had a bad idea has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets and Raul way stations this device is pretty useful\nIf I come down in the morning without she\nCan I can just says okay and then I get to the corner of the kitchen and I\nFind it really difficult to stand up and to get my feet moving so\nI Will have to pulling my leg some holding like putting it on the corner for dragging myself along the the unit and then I get to the capital and I can't stand up straight to say let's let the castles\nAnd I'm guessing from the capital to the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then to have to going to get in the milk when I've forgotten to take it with any it's all said the same with the shoes on it's still hard what\nBut it makes it possible to do those things instead of almost impossible [noise]\n\nSounds like in these issues and then have\nPeace of mind yeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that she can get out of a freezing I said if she knows it's going to happen\nHowever there are still occasions where episodes suddenly come on without warning\nSometimes on the cross quite badly and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be there's nothing I can do except wait for the medication to what the name and\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and by she called move call put them on and she says era of limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven stuff is like the golf so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surfaces flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that I imagine a calm the very easy to see the latest on a sunny day\nYeah mounted mentioned to me that when she goes in ... in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she ... she lasers on so that's one of the drawbacks and she felt an independent not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible out does\nSo it's not a perfect solution from out by the help so do we know how well this ... other people with Parkinson's\n... study was done and it showed that the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants off medication\nAnd when they were on medication the effect was still positive it was a decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent however that was a really small sample size earning Nineteen participants in our study\nThat small and I wonder how do these you know do they make it stand out to a lot of attention to yourself\n... someone in the ... on a train on a cruise to know the panic people food it was a weapon from what I understand what puff have rarely refined products and sent to address some of those concerns but it is who is going to generate tension ... she's in public\nAnd I chose attention to something people might otherwise wanted to be quite private [noise]\n\nSo these two ideas duck pool and lazy she both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old AK ... and they might be all sorts of ways we can treat the brain fall out of the ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area what's happening is wearable tech startups like ... she's\nA kind of tracking you're a scientist laps and that means that the solutions are reaching the real ... quick\nPreviously they would have been but a lot for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of style tops and you're a scientist and professors and you're a scientist so I've been speaking to set this very lucky we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nThis fascinating thank you and things to all

facts that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the Monterey spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections\nThey're spending far less on candidates that we would've expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. with spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its

of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that we looked at this ... this was a social decision for us not a political idea ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S in his formal politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moved like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the n._r._a. campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but professor Bob Spitzer doesn't think financial muscle is key to the n._r._a. influence anyway the key\nThing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money so much as it has been the cell is loyalty of its base\nGun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend a meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call attended demonstration when most Americans stay home in two thousand Seventeen for example\nThe n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities in the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nTo be an array is fine and swimming alone despite its claims of ...\nWell ... does have money problems they spent a whole lot of money in two thousand sixteen election cycle\nThat gave thirty one million dollars to Donald Trump they contributed over fifty million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reporting on in the American media in recent months and\nTheir difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older white male and that generation is frankly dying off\nBack in the Nineteen sixties one household and to have at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there even
