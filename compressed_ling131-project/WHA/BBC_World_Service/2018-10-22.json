World Service my guests today has become one of the world's leading public intellectuals who spoke as much attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and the others through the complex prism of race gender religion class on nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to dig deep into such questions comes from a very personal place\nThe is the child of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will connect ... politician in pre independence gone to\nHis mother was an English woman of artists the classic stall Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy on law at New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner of more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of so can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves undefined others often tends to be focused on division we use race religion on a class to separate us from then increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict an eight\nSo is there an antidote to this preoccupation with group tried well Kwame Anthony Appiah\nFit the beer you have to spend a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves so let's start with a simple question how do you label yourself\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half a gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that are that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of ... identity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals to go into lucky to er about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals from a faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much\nAs I think many people assume\nUh they they will so I I grew up and got on my father was going to end but that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I Know about ... minutes after that he is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if if at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in all of your work on race religion will create as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we're role so complex and so unique but almost any label we apply it in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take all any bill the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even toss in all of those there's so much diversity within them\nSo you know men are all ... men all the same man is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain different from one another people in London a different from one another and a million ways\nOf ... so you ...

I can ... I Believe that I was a long haul into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nThere's the question is where does self identity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm lurching between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on ... not so long ago we spoke to a woman called ritual dollars though who\n... but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and on and live a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black well I think she's a very good\nCase to think about because you ask what's the relationship between ... and and and others I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you can't simply declare the meaning of the euro and writes all on their own race as a social category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's put you you need to sway the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trick trans people have done what Rachel ... didn't do which is they created a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be in our system they've asked us to change the system I'm not I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I am asking then the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nA fragile they'll they'll have could have provided a could've made these arguments on the side of the people in the gum the thing and if you could have done it in the weight of a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important now she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about her but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments living it that way\nAs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other people just to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you would have been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society is simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I get that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as to how to overcome the line is that currently under paying our identity\nWell I think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat's the thing the ones that can fall for that I think some things can be said a but these are the things that are known to social psychologist one is so close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less than people did that so don't allow yourself to be channeled off\nInto a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among\n'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people live all the major kinds and do things with them that's not about race or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nI'm In a building something in the community together woods together with people because I think working together with people to divest identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly if you have folks ideas about them as long as the ... leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people that false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nFinal thought we have a a thing Kevin Rice or in the United kingdom called David good hot who said that these days the most important distinction and identity that that one can use\nThis between those equals anywhere as emotionally coals some ways now the anyways other highly educated usually metropolitan highly immobile people who are comfortable\nIn an open intellectual
