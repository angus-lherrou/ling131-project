United states plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said most go had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces Tracy while America had on a date Russia has denied us claims that it's broken the agreement\nSo what exactly was this particular treated designed to do Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that's a U.S based known punted on organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nI Know treaty was negotiated by president Ronald Reagan and\nSoviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was it was concluded Nineteen eighty seven and it requires that the United states and Russia eliminate and prominently for where all of their ground launched missiles with ranges between five hundred and five thousand five hundred kilometers\nSo that eliminate an entire class a nuclear armed missiles in Europe that were particularly destabilizing in bend a key fixture in the U.S Russian arms control architecture\nEver since and to the day I you know us NATO allies have made it clear that they see the IMF treaty or a\nPillar of European security the American view now is the Moscow had repeatedly violated while America had owners it [noise]\nWell the United states beginning in two thousand fourteen alleged in I Believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles\nProbably somewhere in central Russia off and on efforts through diplomacy to\nConfront Russia about the demand that they return to compliance were unsuccessful but I think the diplomatic options to deal with it so clearly not then exhausted there was only one needy\nIn the past year between us and Russian officials to discuss\nThe matter and so yes Russia has violated the treaty but the question is does us withdrawal makes sense from a security standpoint does it bring Russia back into compliance on think it does\nBut I was gonna say let me put the question back to you what are the implications of the U.S withdrawal in your view\n[noise] well one implication is that the existing constraints on us and Russian\nDeployment of these intermediate range systems could very soon be gone So Russia could expand the relatively small number of these non compliant missiles which are called the nine and seven to nine\nIn much greater numbers meanwhile the United states does not have any ground launched cruise missile four deployments at all so it may be morally satisfying for President Trump to pull out of this treaty because of frustration over Russia's failure to respond\nWe need to realize that uh you know Saudi Arabia is a very unusual place none of us have a lot of insight into who the next later might be if in fact NBS is not the leader so this was one of those things where none of us need to react with pure emotion\nWe need to think this through and make sure that whatever it is worth doing or doing in a coordinated way but look I Would think that uh he himself personally would be dealt with in a very severe way\nTo that extent do you think western

future generations or\nHis willingness to take on the the most fundamental while ha best in the country to do some progressive things and they happen both for human rights another reason so if you listen to those things he's very impressive\nBut then if you watch he's made a number of rookie mistakes I mean what he did and cut her and the way that it without communicating to other countries will no doubt a rookie mistake what he did in arresting the prime minister of Lebanon and bringing them back a Saudi Arabia no doubt was a rookie mistakes and\nHe may have done certainly this goes

that may not feel like that's a lot of all the people but you take that sort of I guess I describe it as a sort of the poisoning division the ... district in this country like nothing else I have seen in sociology is is a reporter ... as you say I'm really glad we had you on the sorry state universities\nAnd when you look at opinion polls do you see any significant shift in public opinion\nOn this well you know I'm not a pollster but I guess what has happened is this and that it's sort of settled down that the if you think about it to ... leave ... remain by almost ... percent yet the polls have settled into sugar pretty consistent lead of about seven percent of people do not think that it was the wrong decision\nTo vote to leave the European Union but here's the thing\nI think a lot of people in this much just they would understand this ... well I think that hasn't quite what has been yet as some massive decisive a public shift ... against ... said I mean it's true that the opinion polls consistently suggests\nThing making the most ... that they are in a shambles as a total with of chaos but I think what you clearly have on how to not be interesting to hear what Rosa men than dining say there's no evidence that sort of people who voted leave half on ... made a horrible mistake\nI Would open up a Rosenman thoughts on that maybe or anything else you wish you observed before I get back to ruled\nBy decree it that much that as well and rice and the assets and oversee the extraordinary passionate and it it was a jelly full price to pay and it was very positive have but you come away rethinking these are the true that the trust of the true believers are they actually come back\nAnd yet I mean did you come across anybody who had voted leave who's now change their mind sufficiently passionately to do something like\nWell I didn't even think they do exist but I just standing there is that is that that that many of them and you might have high\nUm but then again it's the ... challenge and it was somebody trying to direct people and getting to a guy and a different way to the task or not he got caught it difficult to change people's minds isn't that right it's not and I thought well that'd be a problem if you're a daddy\nLook I think the the my worry is that the sort of simplistic tools that we have to decide on on these massive questions referendum that simply involves a yes or no or even an opinion poll that says do you regret the decision isn't going to give us the sort of new ones and there's a fascinating piece of research commissioned by kings College London recently which\nTested various options and ask people to you know with all the nuances of the relationship with Europe to ask people to rank them and make trade offs\nAnd once you get to is the single largest group of ... in Britain one term relationship with Europe that resembles something like the European economic association now unfortunately none of that new one seems to have crept into public debate led learn policy making and so I went back to a very divisive simplistic yes no\nType model when it comes to the public posturing of many of our political leaders and\nAnd I think most people as having up to the fact that that's not how where they are and um they want to much more sophisticated discussion\nRobie last for their thoughts on what what are your thoughts as a result of hearing them\nNo I agree and has a set of changed my view that we are in an absolute whole I mean there's just no two ways about says I mean it's that is that sort of\nToxic combination of having all ready votes as all the way people just divided and such a powerful lay on the politicians I mean the key thing here\nIs that there is no consensus amongst British politicians to six hundred and fifty employees you said in palm as if you if you have to try and get them to unite behind a proposal well good luck\nAnd what about uh Theresa May's position because I notice for example Rosa but on the front of your paper today um suggestions that now more conservative members of parliament might be lining up to try and get rid of a a real how vulnerable to she looked to you this week compared with may be the last few weeks\nYou know I I have all sorts of sort of gossiping about a conservative MPs mumbling ... and with Theresa May but of course the reason she says today is the reason she was\nShe was hit last weekend the week before that\nIt is that the conservatives particularly those who are in favor of a hard Brexit notice a profound break with Europe the caught reading agree on a later it seems to me that they haven't yet go up particularly coherent plan of how the evolution of facts that would be a very passive than hers\nAnd time is running out now does that mean that she's safe I\nAbsolutely no I mean the the whole thing and and the newspapers the Sunday Times and others about ... cents on the conservative policy it's true it's it's not fake\nAnd the people that you were witnessing marching\nUltimately want another vote or are they are they ... I mean shocked me a course where by that could happen\nAll of a lot I think the calls for that is that the talks break down between ... of the European Union and the u._k. a parliament that rejects the idea of Britain just crashing out without to deal with the parliament's con agree on what should happen next in which case over to you people have written a\nQuick final assault cannot happen Denny to secure a kind of happened and of course one of the most interesting between us is is that if you look at the demographics of how Britain is changing pay to count on the pollsters estimated every day the remain vote in nets times grows biased thousand\nBecause all the people who tended to vote for Brexit have died off and young people have tended to remain um have voted in so just the demography as time goes on suggested there'll be more of it remains to build\nA fan of the camp which helped me on friday at one point five million people had died since the invasion died since they recommend ...

do\nWell working for a global civil society alliance um we do attend these sorts of global um discussions like that like the U.N General assembly and trying to I'm this you know get some of the views of civil society and and and citizens across in these very high level meetings and\nAnd also hold them to account because many of these politicians and and diplomats work behind closed doors and do all sorts of deals and part of our job is to expose what they do and and and push for more open and transparent system\nThere's a new project specifically isn't there are all things digital what does

in the digital era\nPeople who is a bit nervous about rules in that area around play because they wonder who's going to be making the ultimate decisions on how restrictive that that will become not only\nTo people seem nervous but there I mean I'm\nOf the tech leaders in in this in the sec to have a sense that rules dark matter and the you know in fact they're going to be better protecting
