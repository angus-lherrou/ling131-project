prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and

types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spells though to those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes that right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improve\nSense about those events\nOne event that will this be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\nSay well I\nLive\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season stunted his mobiles was suggesting we I think there's something wrong with a comma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event to the turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... rage with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nComes very interested in that the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which used as a great likelihood of this kind of event you these very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm and that makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... and you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nWe basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they've warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nTemperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and believe a particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... that's a frustrated wave greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the team we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can lead us look under the bonus of climate change so to speak the ... the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent the interest Michael mind\nParticularly in the light of Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nAs marginal changes to the Atlantic but potentially ... then rapid changes in the Arctic causing even greater along they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most summers and recovering more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaskan Siberia seemed kind of self the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up and I can't and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations and also we were trying to deploy ... and\nYou know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these beliefs and ice that may be a meter thick and you're hoping that it was still survive\nAnd locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through about ... centimeters of knelt since we had deployed than which gets worrying because if the ice gets too thin and ... out then we lose our data\nJudy in St Louis public research is directly related to the climate slash whether issues of this program\nThe present and future operation of Wisconsin Public radio\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

take this to the brain can ... really affects the the markets that really affects ... debt on over the years on\nWhat I think I think the best case for optimism scene from the European institutions perspective is that the markets will discipline the government can you've already talked about Italian public perceptions of law spread so the the the um it's a ...\nA rising of it as a Gemini and and at the same time you hear people that ... I mean I was astonished his thinking on your interview with him that he was saying for example you know\nThey have to send 'em there's no risk we fought for the findings refinancing ... that this is not a government living in the realm of of economic reality I'm afraid and\nAnd it doesn't seem like government you know especially with insurance if you just now leaving itself much room to back down as it is I added to that you have to include the but the fact that there is now there's competition within the government between the Laker now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so\nI I can see this becoming a set of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take in Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism was one phrase used um and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embraces penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit\nHas kinda macho politics isn't it absolutely ... does does cloud ... of the guy who could have a point I mean France and Germany they've gotten away with overspending and and you know exceeding their public debt limits that sets out buddy you why can't it and he just do the same it is one rule for them in one rule fits in isn't it\nIt's not a turkey and reasonable point and I think the the there was some in the commission particularly miss miss the most could reach the commissioner responsible for economic and financial effect\nWho were willing to give it to the government to bits of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate the conflict state they would actually denied the Italian government the chance to a theatrical ... this is disagreements with Brussels\nBut I I think the difference as opposed to keep people here in Brussels or in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France overstepped that um budget rules they were led by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules and we're willing to die that country's back onto a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and at the wildly unrealistic growth expectations in those and say that this is not a government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German Government at the time when they overstepped the debt deficit limit but\nThe European Union can't afford to ... this is this is the ultimately the big problem for actually\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this is also interact with of course the the ongoing debates about reforming the euro zone where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nA countries like Italy liked but also other other countries in southern Europe or who's the finances the weaker and you feel that there is no ... years and he'd been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and and on the other hand you have known European states uh one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is the so called new ... leaks of this new kind of\nA ... a Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who who are very skeptical about any further risk sharing within the Arizona not so going to come to a crunch in mid December to sum it here in Brussels and that may well now take place against the backdrop of escalating a sort of tit for tat between Rome and Brussels which of course we'll make compromise at the summit very difficult indeed\nJeremy ... the economist Columbus and correspondent in Brussels thanks very much for that\nHe brings us to the end of this edition of business day there's lots more business news online that BBC News dot com and remember that\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

two degrees a that was say Twenty years ago so yeah the most significant one name in the last Twenty years I Would say\nI Am glad to see the information in the report come from how they put this
