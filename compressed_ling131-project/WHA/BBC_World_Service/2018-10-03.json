received a large sum of money from his parents contradicting the image he had presented himself as a self made man\nPresident Trump's lawyer Charles how to has responded to the report saying the allegations of fraud of toxic vision of one hundred percent fold on highway ... the president's brother but Trump has issued a statement saying that all the taxes paid on the parents of states\nSo far the president has broken with the practice of past presidents and refused to release his tax returns\nThey'd Boston as one of the journalists involved in the report\nIt reveals to important or is it reveals the central narrative\nThat Donald Trump throughout life it especially as political campaign the president of felt like it started with a million dollars from his\nFather tried to this or that that narrative is actually at a record itself the earth of documents\nFrom any side of the show\nDonald Trump throughout his life he's deeply dependent upon his father's financial support starting from the age of three and let that support continued not just through his adolescence and into adulthood that actually\nKnow into his forties or fifties he was being paid anywhere from five six seven million dollars a year from his father's financial empire\nOne question would be wrong with that I gave my keeps money once in a while\nYeah notice there's absolutely nothing wrong with parents supporting their kid the part where there is something wrong is that the amount of money that Donald Trump received from his father was significantly increased by a series of tax cues very legally dubious ...\nSongs somebody does already talking about ...\nTalking about tax evasion tax avoidance\nTax evasion is illegal and what we discovered was the Trump family for example created a sham corporation\nCould describe large cash gifts from Fred Trump to his children is if they were a legitimate business transactions that in fact they were a\nLike honestly I should do shouldn't island line that dentist quite a bit of it going on here but I Do not unfortunately I the most exercise I get is a playing chess I Would have to say\nOh just like we did bill is joining us visitors used to have you on a David and one of the world's most valuable company just raising wages does this mark the start of a troubling\nAh yes just to bring up to speed with the details and I might add that I get out of breath playing chess\nAmazon has announced it's raising wages to a minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour for workers here that's an increase of four dollars on his current hourly minimum the increase applies to pump time seasonal and temporary workers as well as fulltime stuff\nAnd it comes into effect next month is doing a similar thing in the u._k. Amazon has also said that it will lobbied Congress to raise the national minimum wage yeah\nThe federally mandated minimum wage currently stands at seven dollars twenty five cents an\nHour ... so what prompted the change in direction I have lost\nThis comes in the wake of the fight full Fifteen movement that's a grassroots movement aimed at increasing pay and union representation in the retail and fast food industry is it also follows sustained attacks from politicians\nSuch as bunny sound as who last month introduced a bill called the stop these off act ... of course after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\nWho just happens to be the world's richest men the bill was designed to force large companies to raise wages by taxing them when the ... resorted to benefits such as food stamps for example\nBut cynics would say that the real reason that Amazon is taking this move is well perhaps just a little more self serving in the next few months the company needs to recruit around a hundred thousand additional stuff\nTo cope with the Christmas rush and faces a lot of competition at a time when unemployment talent is it a net two decade low here\nListening closely what you're saying if falls like Amazon has decided to raise the wages makes business sense would make sense\nIt has indeed ended this move is expected to cost Amazon around a billion dollars a year it will be offset though by increased sales and the rise and the cost of Amazon Prime membership is also expected to\nStem stuff to know about Amazon and apparently has hide tonight but writes when it comes to stuff and that means of course that is constantly spending money but quizzing them and training workers and so on higher pay should help the company retain more of those workers\nBear in mind as well the Amazon is expected to announce the location of its second headquarters is by the end of the yeah I don't want to be receiving a lucrative incentive from whichever city it chooses in exchange for bringing tens of thousands of jobs to that areas of the last thing needs\nIs but that announcement to be overshadowed by concerns about how it treats its low wage ...\nFrom the west coast from Los

after a week in which the emu announced it would set up a new financial mechanism\nTo allow companies to buy Iranian oil and do business with Iran in local currency is rather than the u._s. dollars and not of course is to avoid new U.S sanctions are chief international correspondent needs to set asked Mr Zarif how hard it was\nIt is going to be hard because the road of the u._s. dollar in the financial system is pervasive prevalent but the choice is also very clear whether the natural community is going to allow the United states\nTo execute room in the past it did but based on a set of laws but not based on the tests that change every other day\nPresident Trump had a very harsh warning anyone who doesn't isolate Iran will face extreme consequences at what about a country like Britain which wants more than anything else to maintain its trading and political relationship\nPrime minister may as well as president Macron and everybody has said that we are committed unreal committed\nTo see that Iran enjoys the economic divisions of the deep under Europeans\nProbably made better commitments than anybody expected then it was two times they those political commitments in two mechanisms and I believe those mechanisms are going to be in place now the next us\nWhich is the most difficult than important is is to see whether those mechanisms ... three all going to be and it's a bit more patient it doesn't mean that the patients would never run out but we all going to be a little bit more patient to see\nTheir recently out you could take President Trump's offer\nTo

being public enemy number one in the United states to being a leader that President Trump has said he's fallen in love with because it is beautiful letters\nInternational relations is not about falling in both international relations is about respect tank obligations denied to states negotiated at these you know what's happened in the United states from President Trump came to office was not ...\nIt was simply a change of administration\nAnd the nuclear deed is not a person on the line between myself and John Kennedy or President Obama and President Rouhani it's an international agreement

S. that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or a private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region\nYou would be um made to carry a message or the or more just yet where it would go off and they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this\nThey would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound but that would be told that this is a test of the system of the\nThe emergency broadcast system\nYes there was a required monthly test and some places they really tests as well but often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when they snoozing on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is a truck so that any Americans none of the people outside of America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness for people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that's really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um that wouldn't be confusing would ditch\nThe no I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taking a away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think that having that happen right the first one is that is legal they did set this up to say\nThere is a way to you this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically wouldn't be illegal now a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down to legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal as the country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House in Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least I don't think that it would be like his Twitter account were hit on constrained access at any\nTime right so it is slightly unfiltered by the emergency management um uh people presumably Yukon reply so this text\nRight and [laughter] I I Want to think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and send some message either in farce or in you know ... to the entire country\nIn the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through a at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble with an address to see any of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School or just to spoil your anticipation that message are we going to get says this\nThis is a test of the national while this emergency alert system\nNo action is needed coming from the you know are we going to get all caps luck for example well this is this is the thing I'm I'm ... in fact well what a hundred other people are interested in Aden is the kind of the fact that many people\nWho have a positive attitude to the current occupy as the White House will just come and go I don't want to Mr the president's going to ignore it\nEven when it could be quite important and likewise if somebody else we're in the White House\nThe other half of America would possibly avoid it as well as he was saying um it just fills is the president count really send a personal message a bear in mind that these false alarms to actually happen remember Hawaii that there was like a ... there was a a a false alarm the ballistic missile which went home and said he had minutes before\nThe puck was actually pulled the noise by the way from quite pleased we play it ...

seven a nationwide as an average they're raising the pension age to sixty five is that pretty significant leap\nA given that the life expectancy is it's a low still I'm particularly given that many

to many of the just around the world isn't he when\nHe is but you know it's interesting just to watch his ratings because if you look back to twenty fourteen or when Russia annexed Crimea that was a

seven I think at the moment I thought his back below those twenty fourteen levels so he he's not made of ... you know things do stick and it's not just the right thing what's been interesting in
