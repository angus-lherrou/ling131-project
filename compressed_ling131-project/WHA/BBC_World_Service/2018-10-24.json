to\nThe German magazine Der Spiegel discovered that Wolfgang ... have been to saving the Jewish community in pine bugs city for Fifteen Years and not only that but his relatives at fault for the Nazis and he stays James ... been speaking demolishing dairy and it's up to Spiegel\nWe have heard about rumors or concerning the chairman of the Jewish community in ... which is a small town close to a humble and this German pretended to be a Jew but\nHe is not and so we worked hard we made a big effort and research and are\nInvestigated the story of this man and and the end it came out but he's not a Jew is a Protestant his parents approach with students as grandparents were pro distance so this is a fake\nAnd actually that his ancestors had food for Nazi Germany wells and being victims of it\nYes that's the true story he said that his grandparents\nWere survivors of offshoots and his mother was a Jew in Ukraine and a ... and so on and we found out that his grandfather was a soldier on the knock the army and his father was a soldier under Nazi army so everything was wrong\nDo you have a tendency to feel sorry for him that's all\nI have to admit not really because um you offended so many people so many people especially of course the Jewish people in his community I think\nHe should feel sorry for them why have you done it\nWell it's difficult to explain we off to him and he told us that you wanted to be do you love to be a Jew and the so we invented the story to make the people believe that he's a Jew\nI can imagine an awful lot of people in that community across the wide a Jewish community in Germany being pretty outraged about a story\nThat's the case and um I think many people\nBut you know he's not the only man behaves like that there are many people pretending to be Jews and they are not so it's another example and I'm a big number of examples I have to say it's it's it's a problem in Germany\nIs a growing problem something that maybe wouldn't have happened Twenty years ago is now yes\nI think it is because um if you are a Jew us some benefits and um so the people think uh you have a better life even if it's not true\nGiven the obvious history this must have been a very difficult story to report to edit\nYes it was you need to find the right words because you don't want to offend anybody and so you have to be very very careful and writing a story

from rules of civility\nBecause of the uh the a couple of reasons one um uh the names so uh in Georgia a there are a or in America period that there are some common names that are among the ethnic minorities have\nAnd um you know it's for example say that there are five dollars and the river choke on dialysis and the state of Georgia and only one of them is an eligible to invoke a say because they are a U.S citizen or because they um because she is\nA you know currently incarcerated uh because of the exact system they don't match 'em all of the data information so\nI'm One person was ineligible ah we'll get flagged in a system and other people with that name could also be flag and I think the other reason is that\nUm people of color are more likely to be registered to vote via voter registration drive 'em and we tend to vote or register people to vote\nOn paper for 'em and but\nI didn't say other than that we do understand that they've been said incidents with say a busload of blacks Kenyans one table to to continue when they were about to ... to ... to ...\nThat so I'm a week ago a in a rural part of Georgia um there were about forty black senior citizens who were headed on a bus to go register to vote and they were all ordered off the bus\nA because there were complaints that I'm the boss was organized or the voting trick was organized by one of the political parties um and there's no law in Georgia that prevents seniors or people period\nFrom I'm participating and I'm a voter or a bus drive to go vote but um one person in front of took it upon themselves\nTo order the seniors off of the vote and and unfortunately um we have seen these type of suppression tactics\n'em all over the state of Georgia and we believe that it's the ... through the energy and enthusiasm that we've seen for people of color who are interested in participating in the mid term election\nWomen say thank you very much in telling us about ... new group the New Georgia project dune and see who forties beach that nicotine is that when I mentioned in Georgia\nYou keep you from someone on the BBC motives for two weeks to go into the midterms in the U.S next what went wrong we'd so Saddam the new country was born in twin to live with multiple amusement goodwill but just about two years later the country collapsing vicious civil war broke out\nIt's like the same as the author of a room from the sky the making and on making the world news stage it's a book about South Sudan struggles in speaking to James ... last name woman room\nTo get stoned many people both close observers and folks that were new to you for a guy that moment to to those sort of celebrate the world round and I think the problem was that people saw that as soon as one of the south Sudanese project this kind of experiment\nAnd international state building and moved on rather than it was the beginning of that project which took him out of the international community particularly so much the south Sudanese maybe you will both I think a big national\nAbout this but yeah I think South Sudan had an unprecedented coalition of support both among the Africans in the region but also among the wider world not least in the west among European countries in the United states\nIn the book he made the argument is that America sometimes described as the midwife a sassy dodge independence got too close to the south Sudanese to the people who go to 'bout freedom as the south Sudanese so why what was the problem\nYeah I Do think the United states in particular play to an absolutely critical role a huge role in in helping deliver that independence and that is a real achievement but I think\nUltimately overtime that on critical embrace an unqualified belief in righteousness of the cause ultimately blinded some of South Sudan's and the SPA lump supporters to the flaws of those chosen heroes and I think ultimately that both\nWarped to the political space in South Sudan and it reinforces dynamic in which the south Sudanese elites we're increasingly answer too and we're a derive their legitimacy from abroad rather than from their own people\nThat dynamic is really different now if you look at the way American politicians leaders talk about South Sudan there's little support now has America gone too far away but ... to disengage\nYeah I think we've swung too far at this stage there isn't a lot of concern there is a lot of interest about this in the Trump Administration and I think we\nSee that playing out on a day to day basis now where the United states is a two absent from the scene\nYou'll say critical says the south Sudanese leadership solving care was the accidental president uh and you'll woods or complementary thereby wrecked my shot the main rebel leader they signed a peace agreement now are they going to have to work together again it's failed Seventy times in the past ten they work together now\nThe million dollar question look I have my doubts and I had you know I was part of the mediation that helped broker the first peace agreement with alternately failed to produce the real political transition in South Sudan and I have some of the same doubts now that I did then I think this deal\nIs important if it can stop violence in the immediate term if it can allow humanitarian access if it provides an entry point for the international community the best peace deal in the world won't be implemented without the political will I think we need to think in five and ten and Fifteen year terms and for me that means partnering with youth in South Sudan and means partnering with\nThe thirty some things are a lot of politics should be ... locked out of the army\nTotally locked out of politics and have been for too long waiting generational change in their own country I Do have optimism about South Sudan and it's in many ways tied to that generation and so I think the Trump Administration I think western governments I think outsiders would generally do well those to address the immediate term but to start to invest and partner with a new generation and South Sudan\nItaly you'll dealings ways that governing elites who came from a rebellion you ended up as politicians despite themselves in some cases can you get much feeding that they wanted the best country that I prepared to go beyond their own interests and I'm looking at the national interest\nI Do think many of them some of them did have the best intentions of their country at heart but\nThey failed to seize this incredible opportunity they had both apple oil reserves oil reserves that many states would kill for and they had a remarkable reservoir of international goodwill and so they had a real opportunity and I think\nBecause of that history because of they were in many ways disconnected from their own population because institutions went there and there was opportunity for corruption sadly I think they failed in that in season that opportunity I think some of them are repented and some of them have seen what's happened as a result of those failures others I think or not and\nThat in many ways is why I think generational change is the\nFundamental ingredient in a long term transition to a piece in South Sudan\nFrom the sky to making and I'm making of the world's newest book about stuff to

the\nAnd that brings us into the second point which is they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade to international investment to state owned enterprises\nThat's code for China by the way um and the third thing is that they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute supplement system to right now it's really tedious\nLike a an inefficient tried to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started the summer and it's not great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members follow them\nAll these people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to in the United states not being invited to the world's two largest economies so how's it going to look\nIt sounds like a disaster and not have them there but at the same time I might be really inefficient to have them there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joining Canada for this today ... have ideas come up with some solutions and then present them to the to feuding parties says look\nThis is a nice basis for discussion what do you think what do you like and it really takes something on the disposition and personality and great and insurance\nOf the people who are committed to multilateral trade to keep doing that I mean

presidents\nA North American free trade agreement but she has recently done and he took that right to the wire he's pulled out of the Paris or he didn't want to sign up the United states the Paris climate accord he doesn't like international agreements and he says complaining that the United states spends too much on NATO for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that\nAnd to paint the United states has a victim\nChina similarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose\nAnything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate one\nOf the main functions of the WTO they have a lot of tunnels that said that looking at international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments to various different tunnels\nWell this is that so you got the United states and the one hand saying that you know\nWe're going to withdraw if the WTO to shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges who who do all of the education so that sounds inconsistent they would say that this is part of the way of forcing the issue\nForcing the negotiation and we saw the former head of the world Trade Organization amending ... let me say say what you like about Donald Trump\nBy him wanting the trade war with China and threatening to withdraw the United states he has done what many people said needs to be done which is to reform the WTO\nThat was independent research to Stephanie yeah quite an undertaking their Feldman thanks [noise]\n\nA nice day over the last few days you'll be familiar with the caravan of thousands of migrants heading from Central America towards the U.S they've reached Mexico now gaining numbers and attracting political controversy as they go\nThe size of the group is growing from around a thousand to more than seven thousand according to the United nations estimates President Trump has turned the caravan into a major domestic us political issue to accusing the migrants are being criminals among other things\nFor their part the migrants said many of them are parents with young children seeking a better life away from the violence and the lack of a community in their home countries one of those in the cabin is twenty nine year old has a gun as at Clinton yeah from Honduras he's been speaking to news day about why he's on the move\nOn your age\nI'm twenty nine years old on snow for me it's been three years but I was a job it's ... it's a sacrifice and sometimes I didn't have money to get tiny foods I'm truly scared if I'm honest I'm afraid because of this journey is not easy for me this is the first time leaving 'em ... fear\nBut one I remember the necessitate we have about just forces me to continue\nAnd even if I Would like to go back I don't\nKnow because of retaliation that the Honduran government has promised us sing with anyone who returns to Honduras risks jail for it up to four years no votes isn't my fear my fear to starving to death that's my fear\nThe only thing I Hope is that Mr Donald Trump opens the doors to us about such because it's been too much sacrifice to get there an end up with nothing we're not going to steal from we're not going to do anything that would be God's Grace but he can help us\nThat's a Jose gum as ... uh well I took him to Daniel ... a reporter for the political news site in the U.S and I asked him how he sold President Trump would react if he heard who's his story\nI guess I Would say that the president eh she makes the case then you can't be allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border and then you know why does it up and so I think you know Trump he was elected primarily\nAnti immigrant platform in twenty six days and so he's carrying out his voters promise to stop illegal immigration so uh he has said that we should have a heart with immigration policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of\nShowing that they were clearly clean desperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line his rhetoric and so on clearly plays very well to his base with the mid term elections approaching sauce do you think it works with the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nI think a lot of moderate voters they don't like when Trump uses false statements to back him self up when when he was talking about you know unknown middle Easterners\nIn a way in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans or moderates they don't want to use this type of\nYou know racially motivated\nFear mongering that is not even true I don't know\nI think it just doesn't appeal to his small sliver of his base which is still thirty percent of Americans but for Democrats for independence for even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan\nOr immigration policy in general they are do not approve them so they don't want immigration policy to run out of\nThe country by a Steven Miller who is very hard right anti immigrant\nA senior policy adviser to\nPresident Trump is also included said Democrat caravans tried to pin the blame as they were when the Democrats is is a topic that the Democrats than just simply trying to avoid in the run up to the midterms or conversely I wanted to kind of ... most possibly help them in the sense that it might motivate that base perhaps evening courage\nHispanic votes is to come out and vote for them that's a great\nPoint I think Democrats that don't want to be talking about this issue because no political party has a great answer to immigration policy and we've both presidents of\nDemocrats and Republicans they have tried to tackle immigration reform and they've been stopped a in various efforts and some Democrats want to be talking about health care and the economy and Trump's character a and investigating the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but\nYou know this effort to split the country and I Trump in terms of what this is a democratic caravan when are these types of care if it's been happening for the last couple of decades\nAs Daniel Lipman with the Politico a news sites\nAs quite a lot of coverage in this uh on the BBC Web sites or be nice don't come

basically commanded it and said that is what I think has to be established a as soon as possible\nYou're suggesting that some sort of mystery about it but there isn't really is the I mean we have seen

arithmetic is very tight and we got we have to pack up all the way to the point where I Hope and what will probably be the last minute we ended up with a deal which can determine our future relationship with the EU and make sure that we do not suffer the consequences that such a major described\nPoint of all this is the prime minister is being manipulated by the almost impossible pressures inside Iran policy if one if one looks at her positions on things like\nAn off the island backstop which the British Government had signed up to this notion that there will always be a safety net whatever the state's us of a future trade agreement between the u._k. and the you they will always be a safety net which ensures that Northern Ireland and the Irish republican will not have a hard border between them that\nGuarantee offered by the British as long as you'd always last December it now seems has been taken off the table because Theresa May ... get hit by the ... allies in the Democratic union his body\nThat are I think you'll room on this or I didn't think that um she's a day being ducking and waving I think a great quality is that's the reason is unstoppable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt\nThat every waking day the ... prime minister takes and the loss of incoming file for many angles uh mostly from those he won't have a ... ...\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing it she's saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom\nTogether and that the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by

think that will be a way and not stable to analyze it ... and they use various mobbed\nAnd I'm In a very fair minded\nEssentially has the same objective as we do which is that we don't want to\nUndermine the northern Irish peace prices we didn't want to hard boiled between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island of ... and ... sort of more or less is the ... but the ... the point about Canada plus as it doesn't address the ... and ... it's it's still a problem\nSo you know people can argue amongst themselves and an adult pollsters in positions that doesn't mean that the ones

being ripped from the be damaged\nBecause all these bitter arguments over ... brick shit that language has become toxic including talk of Brexit fears of killing his own for the prime minister carrying on new since we're meeting so she got to hang on a cell phone nice being turned in her body what on us is going on inside your party\nBut I I think briefings using disgusting language like that that just to be condemned to me I quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party given the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now over breakfast it cannot possibly deliver a cut hair in Britain ... deal\nActually I think it can because I think that in the next few weeks is the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal and I think\nWhen I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me it can get through the British Parliament but it won't have to support surely of some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off some members at least of the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll pay lawful lots of those who are making the noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the the the new deal that's on the\nTable and they will pay check as all of us so obviously I\nGuess a death is my belief and I think we should than supported\nDon't see how your policy can survive that your former boss well it's getting boring chorus Jones and\nHe says ... is akin to a suicide vest being wrapped around\nThe British nation you'll respond so that was it's one of the most disgusting things I put it in ... in politics you said this is the end of Boris Johnson if it isn't now I Will make sure it is late so I put it to you that if you and people like Boris Johnson who used to work for our war with each other even before\nParliament is the final deal with the Europe your policies finish that\nBecause that that policy as it was bigger than the events that has to cope with in the case of ... as much a journalist as a as a politician says sometimes he uses this Florida language and what was happening was that he was really intending to go into ... with a wish to undermine the prime minister\nOf unrest you regret that now as a finishing off and and that's all if you you\nCan fall rubbish a bar is back in ... in order to try and just get in to back off I had to come first in the end actually that is what happened and I think the prime minister or will be able to deliver this I think talk or by people challenging to a much exaggerated\nFinal four if you are wrong if parliament rejects the buildup threes and may brings back\nFor you want the best option then is it a change of during the ... on a different kind of bill is it a general election or is it A People's a so called people's for another referendum on Britain's relationship with Europe including the possibility we actually staying off the rule\nBut I think you know type of what they call the people say you need to act upon them to make it possible and that ain't going to happen at the moment but I think that if a deal will put to parliament and were were genuinely ... woods cools followed race around Seventy\nThan anything we've been discussing today so everybody should have no idea what would I mean does it would be we'd be getting it's a completely on that into energy\nOf that would have happened and that's why I don't want it to happen which is why as I as one of the older members of parliament appeal to my politics to stick together or to stop I'm having a guy with the prime minister all the time and to realize that you know if we get all this role and we might end up with the luckiest Brecht said oval pull off\nA Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn which is like having Fidel Castro in Downing Street\n... we have to wait and that

for corporations but he won't have any of their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate tax got him there and that kind of an appeal is\nVery compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help them when\nDoes this reflect than a cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think the facts because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWatch Beto O'Rourke and other candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government backed is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nIs being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just click and and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only parts of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them\nIn terms of boots on the streets that's exactly\nRight they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or work is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or worse campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are fish they run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawn facts are official intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system he's having his volunteers and his supporters\nCampaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly send a big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaigns very differently than anyone else has thought possible I think the true test of better works legacy will be\nHow different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on so far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google\nOn recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle federal\nGlucose his current he losing according to the opinion polls by on a percentage point also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment and ensues he asked them to think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls can you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that better work is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\nThough in terms\nOf ensuring our for president here of our country [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been best has stoked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over oil may end up being fairly even so how might this translate into success at the polls\nDoes the money even matter that much Donald Trump off rule under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one much academic research a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential and so just\nSo how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his ways Leon Media Project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lot of time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you were running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters\nAnd who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity\nBut at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you cannot advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much uh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend that last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're gonna you're gonna regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but ah votes as being absolutely bled with the TV's boats wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things but campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive\nDistricts in states and I should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next to the next ten days\nProfessor of government Mike friends separates to oh this also talks political advertising we've been discussing we do wait to see I'm not as\nMuch manipulation on line ... by trolls for example my line foreign actors\nMay have influenced the election that could be the subject for another business dating we shall see but regardless both parties according these midterms

listening to weld update from the BBC\nObsessive compulsive disorder is just sat a mental health condition which the patient has obsessive tools and compulsive behavior is one of the most common types of a CD affecting nearly fifty percent of patients is severe contamination fears and excessive washing\nBut psychiatrists have not developed a map to help those with a complaint to take some form of video which enables the patient to watch themselves washing their hands or touching fake contaminated surfaces above BBC's Tom Field and has been talking to use\nYou can say that's the ... bridge which said like when he was already\nJust comes out and depending on what's your mood and how do you ... just on to those questions so the first thing you you are asked to rate jewel mood now how how tense your feet so you have to wait you're so like how\nDiscussed so you feel right now how anxious you're an once you're done with the questions that would be able to do and this is targeted for you so it's a picture it it's a film of you washing your so smart so washing my own hands the way I wash every day [noise]\nI Do wash my hands quite often like for example if any for touch my mobile I feel like okay sure I wash my hands before I eat anything but I was just touched by more\nEven if I go to ... to make sure I wash my hands either by sign Kaiser or with a so so I keep on washing my hands a lot of times\nThe ... come up on the screen and just to ensure like you're watching the radio and how often radars uses it Oscar you how many ... came up on the screen and that brings you really weren't paying attention and you were actually engaged and it was oh exactly and then it also asks you how you feel after you've watched\nYourself wash your hands and now how disgusted whole anxious you for your\nShow but also the same sort of questions to measure like is it better to watch and ... it was after watching we do\nAll your washing your hands as much as you were to fall the trial or or do you think it's had some sort of lost\nEffect if our chief on watching videos of washing my own hunch all the time ... my mind I was like okay uh so do you think to wash a shot so I can see a little bit different like okay I don't need to wash my hands so\n[noise] well I've been talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developed goes all the brain training act punt who's findings wicked in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage that has some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they're worried that anything they touch\nWill you know a contaminate them\nUm walked treatments currently exist so there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention\nSo in that therapy they as psychologists would act she asked you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you I'm\nGoing wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there are All right there's nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety another treatment as the selective serotonin ... uptake inhibitors these drugs\nThat are used also in the treatment of depression the ss our eyes drugs like Prozac but again I'm about forty percent of patients are don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training app is more effective what's the thinking behind is well\nThe thinking behind it was the festival also when you have to do the C B te therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital\nI have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment and that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments and the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies for that at the world society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should ready to use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself\nSo there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you like on the behavior\nYes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know\nI I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the\nAnd I feel fine I'm not anxious a stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBP therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or used a cloth twice so used to have to throw it away if I was wiping accounted but now I realize that actually there's nothing\nNothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or\nWhen I catch up and I don't need to rush away and wash my hands so what sort of says has have you had with those using this some brain training and so we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive symptoms and they will reduce by about Twenty one to twenty five percent\nSo that was a good reduction because they've only use the F for one week stuff they used it for longer it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a\nCognitive ability so they're not so ... and the cognitive thinking anymore they're not so they ... they can sort of thinking more about goals that they want to achieve rather than these rituals and their obsessive thoughts\n[noise] that was a professor Barbara Sahakian [noise] not one very lucky person is reported to one of the largest luxury jak poked in American history in a drawer last night

overlapping claims with China with me in the studio ... a research fellow at the United services think tank where she focuses on the south China Sea and are we seeing here it's\nUm no I think that China's always actually in the past couple of years especially stress too on as the un member states and that is willing to host a an and conduct\nAnd military a maritime exercises in joint drills so I think this is just a an opportune time where they've all parties have seen that there is a necessity to have some sort of confidence building exercises measures and they're taking each other up of a up on that offer\nBut the countries involved um has not given up a territorial claims you know the south China Sea\nNo they have and so this is really I'm In a way it's it's putting that aside for now um that is a long term issue that that is not going to be solved in terms of deciding which features belong to whom\nI'm the hope is that at in the meantime at least these countries can come together learn from each other build some sort of trust a and make sure that if there's any sort of maritime emergency in the south China Sea they have a basis to worked with each other on us\nAnd is China's thinking that all these countries might come to look upon the United states has the common enemy [noise]\nUm I think China um is certainly worried about the position of the United states I'm In the south China Sea as one that is not going away as the one that will will continue to reinforce its bilateral multilateral relationships in that region\nUm but it is at the same time going to uh exercise it's its own efforts to try and build upon its own bilateral multilateral relationships there\nWe did we stand with some international jurisdiction international rulings on who wins walked in the south China Sea\nAnd we have no international ruling on who owns what in the south China Sea we have international ruling of course\nAs a result of the permanent court of arbitration finding and she doesn't sixteen which are ruled on the nature of the features in the south China Sea and what type of maritime territory they had around them but they made no ruling whatsoever on the sovereignty of those features\nSo um it's still up for grabs is what she was saying and whoever hangs on to water I have a a gets to keep\nWell um it's definitely going to be difficult to say that countries who occupy certain features at the moment will suddenly relinquish them um by ah like I said that sovereignty feature at sovereignty issue is going to be an issue that these countries are are going to be working on a in a very long timeframe\nSo China or the march it's staged do you do see the the potential for may come strict and has occurred in the south China Sea before\nBetween the United states and China on um I mean the the near collision that we saw recently uh between a Chinese and American ship\n'em was certainly worrying I'm On the United states that have been reports that have come out of the United states saying that um they will step up exercises\nUm in the south China Sea that is likely to aggravate China but I think it's important to note that that neither China nor the United states are looking for war are looking for conflict in that region that is hugely destabilizing\nUm and that is exactly what these types of of exercises and simulations are for a which is why we see
