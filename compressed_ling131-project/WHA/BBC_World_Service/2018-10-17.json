mess\nHe said we are not far from a deal so that's the top line coming from the news agencies but you can bet he means a deal that the AAU wants a he's probably expecting you to fold a let's talk about the issue in white is such a big stumbling block ... bottom out as a senior research fellow\nOf the nonpartisan research group UK changing Europe she is professor of a new law so very well qualified at Cambridge University here's a guide to why the Irish border issue is such a sticking point\nThere is a binary choice and I says you have a ... to in Northern Ireland\nBut that means that the u._k. is out to the customs union and can negotiate the free trade deals full we have no ... in ... and the so\nUm but that means we stay in some form of customs arrangement which means no trade deals because the facts all that this is a binary choice said the real question is the new facts that it's actually a shift in political position\nAnd that's the problem and at the moment to reason they has she know Rico room on any shift in his position and that's a real problem and they used to\nAnd if there is no deal done by the twenty ninth of months we will leave with no deal which most come and takes its believes will be pretty catastrophic for the u._k. economy ... great scientists or the you twenty seventh ...\nCan I ask a legal opinion of water border becomes on the twenty nine to ... because of the moment we say there's no border\nWell actually the ... because you've got different currency on one side of the board of the other different tax systems the different social services systems there is a kind of a border when people say no border they made the wrong checkpoints their own horrible business I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties seeing the militarization of the border um\n... is that legal concept of border which might help on the side tried to ... pounds of this this kind of double bind that you've described\nIs really tricky the the real problem what's what's going on here is um the physical infrastructure on the ... and that's the issue because the moment you have any form of physical infrastructure\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game for I'd I don't play but I've heard of it how is it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game it's done again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to social cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and waiting to buy that season pass and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\nSo yes it Brandon Lucas is accused of making these tax to the game and setting them\nAnd these are enable players to cheat basic cake so he's maybe ... ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you to magically\nSo he's been sending these molds to the game online\nAnd the upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yet and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software to afford night\nThat's right that basically accusing these papers copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have ... essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one that surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some ... he says or not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think ... haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fast food night related I vote yeah they they had some people\nAnd this is a different game actually play on line buffalo grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hiking the game um yeah and and historic tape's been going on for years there's always been cheating games and like many things he gets in the video games journalist joining a slight flu\nIs been shooting and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand a bit more now a twenty two minutes possibly out now Canada has just become a leap second country to fully legalize recreational marijuana consumption on site you regard was supposed to\nThe protests began a few hours ago it was midnight struck first Newfoundland and the eastern most parts of the country it's be moving\nAcross a two great celebrations Christmas Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was sending the first batch\nIt's a company called our calls canopy gross it's actually whiter a large multinational company and uh they set up shop in St john's so they will be selling it you know over the counter here um there are about three locations here in in St john's area that\nYou can walk in off the street by the candidates but for for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor\nAnd they brought in older roles of regulation companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there are about twenty two locations off in the in the country right now that in ... in the ... right now they can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government so\nWhile it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies have their eye on this already and we got in first that if the companies that already um\nThat had already set down the\nWith down Bruce and other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move a midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you're seeing the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city about a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight it's quite amazing though I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities millions of people some of them\nAre Canadians of wanted this for very long time and uh when Justin Trudeau ran to the prime minister of the country\nHe promised people he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers that and regulated in an attempt to\nTo grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now are looking at Canada to see what Canada is going to do because our way is the only other country in the world\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within states but Canada\nIs really a leader and a lot of people will be looking at houses\nOn hold it will not be without bomb that hiccup\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there's even enough marijuana that you know one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect the demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of suppliers are probably going to run out even within the first date\nRight is it because it's such a stampede the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but people will have to take it and bring it home or take it in and looked at it private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking that's\nChris O'Neal Yates in St Joe

this new project as well as the Jews are it's got six phases and\nWe'll take more than ten years to complete compete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power now that's about the

Arab uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that threatens\nWe're working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in Airbus Boeing that absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou know the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft some of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example\nSo they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or Paris\nIf you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus splits in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones with vertigo is developing hit the market first and then\nLong term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types then grows\nWe took about taxes I think the tax is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think of the most traffic choked cities in the well a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have ... regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city busy business people five to ten times a year\nWe all find ourselves in these cities where okay my flight was late getting in and I really need to get to a meeting in the city center\nAnd at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere it's really valuable to you to get up
