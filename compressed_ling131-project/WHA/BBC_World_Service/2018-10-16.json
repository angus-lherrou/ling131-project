athletes houses the policy notice affirmative action which many universities choose to adults to give disadvantaged groups a better chance of getting in\nThis means that they're not less in just on academic ability the Asian American students say they were good enough to get in with kept out because African Americans and Hispanics have that chance is boosted by some direction racial balancing it's cool\nThat we hear from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly ...\nI come from an Asian American background and a student at Harvard and I think I should have privileged tendency university and that's a kind of like say how many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case here as a feminist action\nWe shouldn't just be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but try to have affirmative action is impacting different communities and so the point of affirmative action has been any support\nCommunities that has historically the under represented are excluded it seems like it's found Asian Americans right now as it looks like Harvey\n... policies are discriminating against Asian Americans as systematic inland embrace Lauer it's hard to say what my personnel file looks like a set of how it affected me but I think the interesting thing\nIs to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in an ACA rapidly but the amount of Asian and Iraq and admitted to Harvard has been saying around the focus on that I hadn't yet\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard and who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kelly ...\nA ... a her stance\nMakes a lot of things and I I'm happy that she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action is supportive of affirmative action is not as she said to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of affirmative\nAction is to increase diversity increase the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been that's not been talked about how much in this\nLawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass\nHere harboring or many other colleges and universities are across the country there are a critical masses isn't quite frankly Asian students um don't have to walk on campus and feel like they're necessarily represent those are the group um or that they have to speak for every person from that background um is is particularly true of Chinese\nUm students are are students of Chinese backgrounds however for African\nAmericans for looking all Americans were insurgents Americans is is not this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even ways affirmative action as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but it was before you were ... you were UCLA I'm One of the complications to this fact is is that in California\nAffirmative action isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I presume that that's how you felt\nOh absolutely and it was the case um I entered into a class of about\nAnd I was one of twelve African Americans um this is\nAnd the state of California which is as much more than just style for or start a career or three or four percent African American and then she environment which I was you know in class thinks they're failing highly intellectual and highly\nSocial issues that involve things like raise 'em in history and I was one of two African American back in the room this huge effect on my ability to um\nTo judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without feeling like I was speaking on behalf of everyone\nI can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional and of course what you'll you'll have to study principles and argue about a sort of intellectual facts are without being muddied in that way [noise]\nI Wish that was the case yeah unfortunately it very rarely happens that way\nBut for example in your class was than not one or two Asian or a Chinese and Marilyn how did we should just find them all have failed Reggie managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support and critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that there are underrepresented sub groups are going in Asian Americans are among the ... as a Southeast Asia and Pacific Islanders students are absolutely underrepresented um an all facets of higher education\nOr if we're going to talk about Asian Americans as a as a general group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice affirmative action in I argue schools that do\nAnd why would that be\nI think it has a lot to do with the caliber students applying a number of students applying\nUm and we did they decide to activate their applications are obviously I I think it makes a lot since a lot of Asian Americans apply to harbor um one interesting fact about this entire lawsuit that is not discussed as much as that I'm\nTwenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year um roughly\nAs Asian American but also twenty two percent of the application pool is Asian every year well\nThey ... up affirmative action two sides of the student argument is an argument that uh is being taken to the court case or taking to coach a against Harvard University at the moment I should say is a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action but ... as a private institution\nOr because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and\nDo it and it's just it's a private institution that they can make that goes on you know less than it would it be you have to be in a state where you can have affirmative action uh and many people are interpreting this is really significant court cases\nOver the legality of affirmative action in many of the ... not just in the academic sphere and I'm a there's lots of accusations about who's on behalf of whom and who's wearing a tool divided along sort of community\nAh backgrounds no one talking about class in Britain that would be a class issue a rather than a a a race and\nThe ... election issue or a little more

County United Way dean county dot org\nAlso on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare Claritin Schiller or many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that I'm the same age as as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think are writing ... crosses mine could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute co form one another\nThis for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply arrive in the morality of the author or more likely\nA one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of cross as more humorous pieces are set up pieces as what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries manned by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of heart in excessively floor pros juxtaposed against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing as he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden duplicitous ... or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they [laughter] yeah and these obstacles off for the religions to classic works of Jim and ... and Shakespeare as you've said and he will say continued the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of the truth or principle you've heard a few of these already and ... started including them in difficult from about Nineteen oh six and lights it published than in book full several

something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows it's only Katrina why was say it's so important to him\nWhen I think I had to really ambivalent relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't work out and and he very much disliked modern development for instance um\nThey give back to max Reinhardt who've maybe famous said class this time in Germany especially\nOn a mental showy um productions\nAnd contrary to cause he kind of embrace that he actually 'cause blender\nBut what crossed imagined or was it ... ... for the spoken good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama\nUh itself and nothing else\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crafts than is before the first World War II is someone who is surrounded by lots of colleagues fun to watch his\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably other choice and pulling the others circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be full of and also because he was Jewish\nI think uh to kind of reiterate one of the month points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious\nPolitical um I think that he saw dangers in complete media you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it's assembly because crosses born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own or relationship maybe you'd better sectors own\nJewish identity um but just to give another example crosses thoroughly booth law\nBut his sympathies in his early life later with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so and sometimes never with the class to which he I'm officially belong Americans as one example of saying crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements cross was ... months and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that is great love ... not hung up about ... patron of the ... based in a small shot so about a hundred miles south across his birthplace in what is now the Czech Republic\nI'm the only country in the ... what was the relationship like\nA wild first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and ... Daniel CD as he called her she inspired class to write poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over thousands letters to hurt you and the closest of relationship the relationship lasted with interruptions until his death\nAnd maybe it's especially noteworthy that crust he had his hands full with a his work you just mentioned the nine hundred and twenty two issues of the fact that he didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case uh he really sat down and wrote like every other day a very long letter\nHers lettuce to him my loss um we don't have them\nBut do we know from his lead us that he shows are very different kinds of personality and in them he's really in love you I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not\nShe wanted to marry properly another aristocrat\nBut she's still kept having a relationship with crowd is continued to meet him to travel together and you can really call her one of the most important um women ...\nQuite a few so that he had this lonely image isn't true yet actually quite a full of life I think\nAnd incidentally herself she provided a quiet place to rest of the woods for him and she may have inspired some of the grounds his best a limit perjury here is the end of ... cool too\nWho tend to do well remembered mine praying a suit to rest muscle so that this final trace of godly grace may remain\nAnd even the crowd was usually suspicious of new technology an interesting fact is that he\nDid ... a calm fairly early on in Nineteen fourteen and soon when he was so taken by the pleasures of driving she became one of the first female holders of a driving license in Austria Hungary but the carefree days of muttering across Europe was soon titled by the outbreak\nOf the first World War and how crowds reacted to the war is the subject for the second part of this for them to maybe she will service will be back in a couple of them are [noise]\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
