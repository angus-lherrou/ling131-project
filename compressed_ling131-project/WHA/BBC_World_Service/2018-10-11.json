challenges of working with afterwards as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining we see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons\nSo with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and
