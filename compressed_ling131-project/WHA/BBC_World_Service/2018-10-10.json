I never worked with them I Know I ended up working with them I always ended up working with people who later became friends and then I kept repeating working with them\nSo up to be honest I avoided a direct golfing out problems\nAnd the way you deal with them is to avoid working with them to do where you vocal against these people that are passed these induced\nYes in the beginning I just said that okay no thank you I I look at some other people because I I I don't I I Know with a ... or something like this but it's you know the thing is it's never did act\nIt's always it comes in I'm In a

up working with people repeatedly working with people who became friends and who really meant professionalism and walk and uh there was no pressure on you know and that was the old ...\nAnd that was your way of dealing with it ... the editor of the news the minute told the BBC so many allegations have come a have come out now and something needs to be done about ... you've had the time and again

moms today it is still too many Muslims something very rare and and strange and before we started them off two years ago in Denmark\nThe majority of Muslims in Denmark didn't even know that scene in

about creating change on the ground and if we look at the ... at the changes that we have made so far let me give you an example then assess a team of interfaith marriages today\nMuscle and they cannot marry outside their faith unless the men converts to Islam unless you are cultural in Laughlin you do not\nReally practice um so this is actually an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even UK to get married and then my mosque because we are able to serve them and we are\nMaybe the Koran with a focus on gender equality allowing less than women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they change the law last year in December Seventeen so now it's also legally possible to marry outside Islam for a woman it has always been a possibility for the men because it's stated clearly in the Koran that a Muslim men can marry a Jew or Christian or non Muslim\nBut the the opposite is not stay the candy but he does that stayed either that a woman conned so we use that as already Timothy\nBut you've got another problem there are many people in Denmark a politicians of the rights in the far right secularists those who have a deep suspicion of Islam and

said that we have to understand we're living in a globalized world and if you're living in a globalized world you have to ask yourself what do you what do you want to have a dialogue with people and

to you and why freedom of speech is an essential value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd the sacredness of the Koran is also and the Central Valley in too many Muslims in the world so we we

yours he felt that you'll find for what you believed in was dangerous to your family and in the end it seems that ruined your marriage white with it\nYes it was worth it because I think that there are so many people they want the rather than ... they support the revolution and they want to change it\nBut they just don't want that all ... all that wife to be ahead of the rather the ship and somebody has to be a head of the show so to me it was not a matter of choice I'd ever make a choice\nBecause I place myself ahead of the revolution and it's impossible to withdraw when you're just started
