key senators despite an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations\nIn a public hearing last week professor Christine Blasey Ford said she'd been assaulted by judge Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers in Nineteen eighty to judge Kavanaugh denied the claim an allegations that he drank to the point of memory loss of the time this in a feisty confrontation with Senate says\nThe Republican Senator Susan Collins who is a key swing votes in the confirmation process that said she doesn't believe the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh of strong enough to stop he's confirmation as a Supreme Court justice\nThan that ... percent said do not me that her that's her for what's not sexually assaulted that night\nAt some other time but they do lead me to pay ... had the allegations

change of heart Brett Kavanaugh will take a seat on the Supreme Court bothers Republican Senator John Kennedy explained the struggle to get a judge elected has done real damage to the credibility of America's top cooled I\nUnfortunately was viewed by many Americans even before this is what\nWas saying there's politics practice in a different way and\nAnd the Supreme Court I don't think it really

hand we have ... and the Democrats who's going the other way and he says he will support judge Calvin up so it's things down that effectively leaves the Senate as it is within comes in each other a large so us us things done at the moment it will be fifty one vote sort of a hundred for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that means he is likely to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAre there any other figures who people are still wondering about in terms of their final decisions\nEverybody know his sort of get an indication of where they stand now there are still some people wondering about Jeff ... now he's given an indication that he will support Brett Kavanaugh but you may well remember the he was a senator who became concerned after he was approached and indeed cornered by a number of protesters\nIn a left in the Senate buildings at one stage and it was last week that he said he wanted an FBI investigation he wanted to take a pause\nThis pretty little doubt that most remains who do take part will vote yes to this question so they do want gay marriage effectively banned under the constitution the big question is the turnout one I mentioned\nIn the introduction phase of hatred being stood up of an increase discrimination is that already evidence of that happening\nThere is I mean I'm\nUnder the remaining civil code a gay marriage is already not possible so basically there's a contradiction here with the constitution which the draft is\nUm and backers of this referendum tried to iron out but already gay people in Romania as in many countries in Eastern Europe field and not welcome they're ostracized\nI'm there have been cases of uh graffiti being painted on ... and and just in general it's not very comfortable to be a gay person in Romania\nAnd gay people feel that this referendum is actually sort of whipping up a campaign against them and that whatever the results of the referendum it'll be more difficult to live as a guy posting in future in Romania\nAnd handed it to somebody to go but within parliament within the political circles what's the view\nThat view is pretty much solidly an interest in this is happening on the other time of the the government being led by a U.S the Social Democrats so effectively the left which tends to be more liberal in other countries but they've backed this referendum initiative complete the as\nHave most

that time traveling between different vocation is that we're about to explode\nAnd the difficulty is also is that I think in this case it was evident that the monitoring systems went whacking\nBut the difficulty also is when do they cool when did when they made the cool because if you evacuate people too early and then nothing happens as invoking people some people believe it last next time and that's when dangerous things can happen and when people can move back into the home to the base of Kenya for example and then when they expect\nAnd so I was struck by by basically you know how how how difficult it is to get around to the major and how they were spending my time doing that\nBut also how they have to sort of balance that the that that is monitoring systems but also with the human the

the previous winner Maria Gifford mile\nIt's great times are changing\nI cited it gave it my my and I read about her and realize that you know she didn't even get to be a scientist while she was doing the research and I've always been treated like an equal my career show things change\nWell somewhat ironically at the beginning of this week for European organization for nuclear research son suspended\nShe said physics being invented and build by men he also claimed males scientists were being discriminated against because of political ideology rather the marriage\nDon't carry Brenner was a senior physicist at the science and technology facilities councils central laser facility where she works with some of the most powerful lasers in the world I also for her reaction when she heard the dome Strickland won\nI stood up and did a bit of a fist bump and just yelled out that yeah it's a high powered laser as advised Dona ... has been recognized it's just fantastic\nWhy does it matter so much to you\nKnow first of all it's fantastic that our field of physics is being recognized it's important area of physics it's great to get that powerful but secondly the right people have been recognized for the joke that they did\nUnfortunately in the past that have been instances of discoveries and big breakthroughs on certain people get recognized that or the other is this time around donors Strickland on she arrived Murray had both been recognized for this prize equally answer that that there aren't that\nMany women in physics compared to men at present and that there are so few women that have been recognized by the Nobel physics prize committee it's a nice bonus to that situation we now have three women that are recognized in the physics hall of fame of making contributions to science and innovation as we know that\nYeah I'm so proud to be in the same field as Dona Strickland and that the physics she's enabled the technology and now the innovation and the impacts were making with these discoveries\nHelp those of us who are not experts in laser technology to get a sense of what she's actually dumb and why she has one moves\nIn the Nineteen eighties when people were building lasers and I'm trying to make them more powerful\nThat became they reach stay a threshold set point which they couldn't increase the pilot anymore because the pilot and intensity and the team would break the equipment the optics and the marriage that you're trying to build with so they needed a technique that could boost the energy while keeping it below what we call the damage threshold\nOn the application of this I was rooting for example laser therapy targeting cancer corrective laser surgery it comes into those kinds of world's doesn't\nIt pays the way for building pulses of light which could have a power or intensity that is high enough to change the says they said things about that stuff is is it a pack of someone's up by ... and material for dating lays the cussing owners ice fields of ice and up\nAnd I'll feel what I end up with the ability to see the heat and transform us to the full state of my ... plasma\nSay other than the last Twenty years I'll say we've actually increased the power so much so that we cannot suit the heat material to millions of degrees in ... second I'm currently using that to build a next generation\nOf accelerators that can be made to produce pulses of X rays neutrons of particles that are used for advanced imaging in health care and medicine but also the moment in nuclear and airspace inspection so the area and the threats of applications and impact of high powered lays it is huge\nYou Harlow to the ... she is only the third female winner of this prize and your fellow female physicist I Wonder what it means to use specifically on my level\nFor me it provides a role model the more the merrier in terms of you know women being recognized for the way that they do and the contributions they make and yet it adds another level of diversity in this field which is good for showing people that women and physics do exist we all leaders and we make a difference to the field\nBuilt by men well I think today that he wasn't in the past women's contributions have not been recognized ... play that times are changing it's important to change an update culture associated with science and technology\n[noise] talk to carry Brenna on the success of donors Strickland the timing of which Patricia ... somewhat ironic in lots of those remarks we refer to remember to date\nI have to say as as somebody who works with guards and this may be fighting for the antique again\nTo say that physics was built by men the discipline up in this study of may have been defined by man I think the laws of physics operate generosity\nIs you know what I mean I think it belongs to all of us so once you understand it as a discipline that's been built into particular way and you understand the structures of society then

I Would call them ditch the bread crumbs but also some physical evidence that would then\nUh they think they need to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the uh these as spies ... in April and the only had about ...\nYesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of ah\nCoordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm\nJust on a purely practical level um it seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives\nOr a Twitter been infiltrated we've seen really what looked like clumsy attempts that that have been really quite effective and\nTo me what on setting as a storyteller it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean is there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's mind you think\nWell I think of course like you know a ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective\nHaving all these governments coming together right and accusing Russia that also puts Russia and the and the way in a good place like you know that manage to get like the guy that all these governments and to have all these like press conferences ago across the globe I guess we see like that does them any good days\nAt the end of the day or you know when you are a you know I caught\nYou know ... you know seven times a then it's kind of a you know like with what we saw yesterday was that can help to them in a way I kind of like put things into perspective and probably you know what they've been trying so eager to lead to prove that they're so great at these kind of like starts in people's minds actually you're not that great\nI mean you used the word embarrassed when you look at the main figures in the ... and when you look at ... ... for example he doesn't look very embarrassed\n[laughter] yeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know it was I was behind\nThe scenes there may be people looking at a red faced\nI'm sure they didn't receive than use our like happy faces I'm sure that was like something that caused a you know international bathrooms especially that you are you know when you try to show off your at your skills and then you get called ... at a time that's not really a great day for you [noise] ah\nBut that's also like you know just like the the Russian an additive old ways you know whenever they're called whenever there's an accusation is oldest denial it's always like you know ah they look at the uh the investigations they always say there's no blue ... all of your city although we did see you know the ... pictures and all of these things\nSo that's that's not really surprising thing\nFor you when it's not just as soon as I said I Do find it I'm finished that it it it just creeping into our everyday lives and the things that you think we could practically due to to to push back not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives that allows to push back against this than\nI think that's a very good question and I think you know a one of the things that we could do as citizens and our daily life it's back to something called digital and hygiene\nSo very small things such as like you know\nA changing your passwords often backing up your data being a little bit kind of like vigilant and careful how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right you wouldn't leave your ... open\nAnd I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like back this nice minimal things that would I mean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of ended up getting back to this um a digital and hygiene you could limit up to eighty percent of the size of the crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex the geopolitical level is that the choir\nLike this sophisticated level of sophistication\nAnd I'm a geopolitical level do you see any sign of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level so late to this this month Russia is lining on submitting to drafted as it use and\nTo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for how states should behave as a to get a you know each other into cyberspace\nBoth one or two adjusting and use cybercrime convention to the place one that has been a um implemented by the concept of Europe so obviously there's a lot going on on the international scene that has not been linked in the media to what happened\nOn Saturday Russian activity and like you know age they wanted to step in the but also they want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that the upper paying something and the information we now that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals safeguard that on on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against these additives yourself they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries you know that are no you know Russia or China or like with the states that are in the middle of the ... the undecided kind of like you

Hong Fincher has been following this story and the story of the other women in China who are fighting for quality a new book is called betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China and she's joining us to do in Brazil in West in England at least welcome good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for having me\n... described the feminist five fish will tell us a bit more about the\nUm well in twenty fifth Cain there are a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China and wanted to celebrate International Women's\nHarassment stickers at subways and bus stations but before they were even able to to carry out that activity\nThe Chinese police carried out a really sweeping round of arrests in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women to Beijing where they put them in detention and the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually provoked at an enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... so the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as him preview unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular a\nMuch more broadly defined clearly are the ones who've made headlines for the reasons you just described but how much would the representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise]\nWell this is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected a by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism\nUm but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger and um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women in China who have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiterally to bring my guess would do as well I'm Emma may be a question too\nClose kind is it am I wanted to use it as green today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect of me to currently on the ground [noise]\nYeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally when me two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles\nThere's very very heavy Internet censorship there is no press freedoms so unlike in the U.S where on the news about Harvey Weinstein in you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations\nBut there is um but news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse and China have virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles\nAnd and today you still see young women are emerging up all across China\nUm across sectors even across class\nComing out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse\nFor me to post to being sun to come on [noise] well\nThey a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the meat to hush tax so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when uh me to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively\nHim oh jeez I'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie image eat meat tool to get around and at at work for a while but then the ... right Patricia\nI'm I just wondered whether this movement to begin to manage it by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese farmers have changed so much with the sort of one child policy on that because there were probably a few a woman but in more than ... than that then they might have been a generation of but whether this played into its at all\n[noise] well I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThen she doesn't have to compete with a brother for parental investment and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently so troubled by this I mean when you look at ... ideology that doesn't necessarily say to you that you should be what rate of of women complaining for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written in to the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of ... famous sayings is got women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... uh for several decades in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of\nPay well everybody was poor but but there wasn't just a huge and growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown and financially and that's one of the grievances that the main grave and said these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home ... just on me to say
