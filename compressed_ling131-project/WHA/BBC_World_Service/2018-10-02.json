a year is considered to be a normal figure here we have\nMore than sixty I've been speaking to on through brown low director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is so different to what we would normally see in in what a cold ... usual mortality events because I'm the conferences that are coming at a ... ... credibly decomposed so\nUm we we actually had an investigating this last month pathology point of view and more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed up and then they die that that when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at ... uh the causes mortality of of mammals uh stations sales et cetera\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold must running events where we turned up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the last uh some of them on the beach some of them alive some of them that\nI'm I'm way investigators try and work out why they're strong thing happened in this case it's it's a very different picture of what we've seen is over the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidents of I'm a very unusual species that's being washing up right from the sort of the the\nGo away by an island all the rights of the top of Scotland\nUm so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at say I'm butts\nAny of these animals coming on TALK shows how many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year\n[noise] so in a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she by ... by these these class substitutions\nI'm On this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals that have been washed up on the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ...\n[noise] they live very deep and the water they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible to speculate might be happening [noise]\nWell this is what makes this quite tricky because they um that they as you say that the species that live well off the shelf age so they they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal um they're being ... to just a\nUnder three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down the\nThe reason they go into the that they such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for the species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash your shoulders by limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because they've been such a expensive state should take 'em position\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species\nIs particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... underwater noise in an in specific the effects of mid range segment on that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf age\nI'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bottom\nAnd the ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time but something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nUm indeed it does I mean we we've we've made the oceans vide noisy place in a ... of the general problem in this specific case\nFor them we have is is that they ... out of the people that all the lights they made right inside and all of the military and loving information from than can be quite challenging\nUm the reason that the military ... a an a sudden all this frequencies is that it's used for um communication on the association for locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive at a national security level so they're trying to get the information as to whether they'd be an operation can be challenging however what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not there is\nA noise is a plausible reason that these animals taunted so we want to let all the other things that could potentially have caused them to strengthen such as toxins infectious disease\nI'm I'm trying to establish what what is the most likely reason for this this large mortality\nSo many questions Andrew Brown do director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme on those sixty

scandals around the\nFederal company and the buying of votes how excited are Brazilians about voting for any politician\nI'm not sure that that excited that there's a lot of trepidation about this on
