you there\nI'm here Chris I'm half of why from here I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing with good stories of our fellow Americans this week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York autumn is I rolled into New York city there's something magical about falling\nBetween the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone [noise]\nThe streets worse colorful as always and Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nAs a hat [noise] I have\nI walked into Washington Square park who sat on a bench near a dog run there's nothing crazier than a New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are pets that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to be on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their minds\nI sat next to one of the dog owners musician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike the collar and an upper lip and permanence ...\nDavis lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now is a studio musician he was lamenting about how the city's changed\nThere's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos or too strange to live in their hometowns but now there's nothing left that the weirdos can afford\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park\nRocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pug a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with her nose\nList as New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on a normal night's this area's hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous\nThe bars were in full force than people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costumes or the scariest part of Halloween\nAt least when a child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise]\nAs I headed down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty ... murder\nHis face paint was smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused he grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where\nI felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends was looking for where they smart sue did they live in a magical land should I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree\n[laughter] I felt bad for them so I took his big white hand in mine and walking down the street have you ever gotten looks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the summer for lovers [noise]\n\nTry to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view the postal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes\nOf climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dress like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side frozen like a very ... [noise]\nWell I've never heard alive Kuala bearing couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin runs the broke my heart\nJust as I was about to help three others marks came running up and grabbed\nLong lost brothers hug them and knock them to the ground in a pile of blue and white for I felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away\nHave you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer so stuffed animals [noise]\nThey insisted that come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train as a bank you we went to Joe is on ... street sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window most people just by through the crowd and take their slice outside\nI was worried about causing is seen by walking in with these murders\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy devil a hotdog a Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\nDavid rocker was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weirdos they have a happy Halloween everybody and until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\n[noise]\nFirst Jeff Tweedy how you've been man I'm great yeah it's great\nYou are going to want to vote for me I\nJust remember if you
