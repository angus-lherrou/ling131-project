decision making their studies memorize of inmates from Wisconsin prisons have led to a new evidence that the physical base is very psychopathic behavior\nWelcome to University of the year thanks thanks for having to be here there was a psychopath those of the quotation implied\nHave to do damage to others or couldn't be just sort of a form of compulsive behavior I mean I think of you know build a Marcos going out and buy three thousand pairs of shoes that are really harming anybody but it was definitely abnormal\nSelf driven behavior\nYeah I think that's a good question the ah I think the answer is no it doesn't have to harm someone and in fact one of the most overlooked facts in this whole field is that the behavior psychopathic individuals'\nIs as personally costly as it is socially costly I'm really they're the number one victim of their own behavior they lack inside they do things without thinking and the consequences are a terrible that can cause them to lose their freedom that can cause them to be hurt seriously and accidents and ultimately culminating death\nIs a just a matter of losing track of the connection between cause and effect faction in reaction\nI think in terms of the way they evaluate their own behavior is the question you're asking I think again that's a good question um\nIt's probably the hallmark of the disorder\nThat they don't automatically realized the consequences of their action so people often say they act without thinking that's true but even for the rest of us when we contemplate some action we automatically\nUnderstand the implications of that action and where it's leading and people competing seemed to have a disconnect that causes them to be oblivious to those consequences or where those actions might be leading\nWell let's get a good definition because there's a lot of other sort of disorders like antisocial behavior or other mental illnesses what do you have to do to earn a label is like a path\nYeah I mean you began with a quote by Robert hair and I think there's no doubt that he's been the leader in the field now for decades and has written some of the most authoritative work and also developed a hair psychology checklist which is considered the gold standard for measuring psychopathology um\nYou're going to give us a check list so sort of put it on our kitchen wall [laughter] I don't\nFear the self rating and rate your spouse or your friends but you know I think when you know today we benefit it's so much from having this very good operational definition psychopathology that comes from the checklist that you know the way we define it as predicated on that so within the checklist they're inter personal symptoms which means\nThat when you act or you do so I'm really to your own benefit and without really considering the needs and rights of others are there's an aspect of component to the definition of psychopathology which means that\nYou don't feel things as deeply or it's more of a shallow aspect that your experience there is a behavioral impulsivity component which is that your impulsive and your irresponsible you act without thinking you don't follow through on commitments that you've made\nAnd then there's an anti social lifestyle component which is that\nYou're never really um get on track in terms of planning and doing what's socially expected so those would be the four major components of psychopathology I think with regard to definition I'd like to elaborate further you mentioned anti social personality disorder\nThat is the official DSM diagnostic and Statistical Manual I'm category here there is no formal a diagnostic category for psychopathology\nThe difference between anti social personality disorder and ... the thing\nIs that anti social personality disorders much more generic if you have a problem of 'em are engaging in anti social behavior we call it conduct disorder in children and then that persists into adulthood where you don't have a normal job and you start fights and you um are arrested\nA use in the in the not too distant future as opposed to you know diagnostic where you are you are to psychopathy\nSo once of promote immediately practical standpoint once these individuals are in prison anyway what would the prison do differently if they had done a fide by brain type and behavior a psychopath but on the inclination toward psychopathology would they be more likely to put\nThe segregate them in terms of the prison treatment of lows of various prisoners\nWell immediately nothing and this gets to a point of rights and welfare of the participants so one condition of the research now is that the results of their study of our studies that we do well in in any way affect\nThe inmates standing in the department of corrections so it's entirely isolated from how they're treated now in June and says yeah I\nThink one of the things that might be important is that people that psychopathology I think the evidence is not that strong but they're often thought to be anti social for different reasons and that those reasons make them somehow untreatable and in certain places around the world they may be denied treatment\nAnd you know one of the uses of this kind of diagnostic information as Mike said you can't clearly are perfectly identify individual but if you have an idea that probabilistic Lee this person has is behaving in an anti social way because they're psychopathic\nAnd this person's behaving that way because of their environment or because they're emotionally reactive\nThey may have very different treatment needs and I think that instead of denying people treatment because they score high and psychopathology scale if we realize that their brains really are wired up differently\nThat the reasons for their antisocial behavior or different that we might be able to develop more customized interventions that are effective for people who have this type of brain\nThe sort of the population of the Wisconsin prison system that you're working with you know mentioned you mentioned that it was in many ways well rhyme you know kind of compared to some other places in the country but it also has a record as having an incredibly bad record for\nDisproportionately locking up African American men for example and ... got a lot of situations where the people who end up with long\nPrison sentences or those with out the money to pay for a fancy lawyers so what do you do in terms of than the uniqueness of the population that you're looking at and have you as you're working on this kind of as sort of seen evidence of injustice behind who is behind bars\nI've published a few papers on this and then sensitive to it I'd like to\nSee if we're on the same page in terms of your opening statement which is that I think you're right that in as I understand it in Wisconsin prison system I think about forty percent of the population is African American whereas only about eight percent of our population is and so that makes that sort of support your point that it's disproportionate\nBut they don't see that as the prison issue I don't know what's leading up to that incarceration\nUh once they're in prison as far as I Know they're treated very similarly\nNow the question that I think flows from your premise is that you know are we finding the same kinds of problems and African Americans are that we're finding in the European American offenders and I think the answer's no and let me clarify that\nWhen we do work on ... and I have been doing this now for decades and there are certain very key differences that are associated behavioral differences that are associated with competing in terms of how they perform a motion tasks or inhibition tasks\nAnd we find these differences very clearly in the European American offenders but when we look at sub samples of African American or offenders we don't replicate those findings we don't find the same powerful statistical relationships that we find\nIn the European Americans and we've published these failures to replicate I think that's very important because it even if people have done crimes that are incarcerated for that reason and even if they are in high ... scores because they satisfy on that particular items on the checklist\nThe meaning of those high psychopathology scores might be different in the African American in the European American samples\nFor me that also means that we certainly would want to take that information into account in terms of what the treatment needs are or in terms of how amenable people might be to treatment because it seems like the process these underlying their self regulation problems are different\nAnd maybe I can just add to that and Joe correct me if I go off the rails here but just by the way of a\nA more sort of specific or concrete anecdote related to what Joe was talking about how\nA particular kind of inmates in like an African American in made from um\nYou know a slum kind of neighborhood for anyone from Islam kind a neighbor that example could get scored in a way\nThat is not consistent with how people from other backgrounds might be scored so imagine someone who are young men are on the age of Thirteen or fourteen starts you know leaving home and running the streets in primarily you know making income from drugs and not being at school and and not being at home I'm\nThat person would score on the on the top of the checklist they would score for what irresponsible behaviors are impulsive behavior [noise] um so if that happens in the context of a\nStable you know middle class neighborhood that's pathological behavior but if that happens in the context of the slum where at home\nYou know maybe mom's a prostitute in her boyfriend's beat her up and beat you up and there's not really food it's not a safe environment um you know have your basic needs supported well I don't know that it's pathological that you would seek refuge from that and you know find ways to hustle and make money however you could but yet those good scores\nAnd so the tide of two points to go to the one that I made and Mike followed up on given that those environments may sort of\nFor the scores it seems meaningful that we don't see the same cycle biological correlates when we look at them in the laboratory\nSo so in other words if you're looking at the way the brain reaction was psychopath you'll see that or whatever you want to call it in ... in that part of the brain whereas if you look at somebody who was simply has been through the school of hard knocks\nMay have behaved much the same way but it wouldn't have that development that's that's a that's a critical question one that we're actually in the process of trying to figure out right now and I would\nThink it would have some implications for the legal world as well and for for treatment and we'll talk more about that when we continue in a moment where the University of the air\nWisconsin Public radio is the surface of the Wisconsin educational communications board and the University of Wisconsin Madison with

radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nAnd manly our back back with Norman Gillum land our two guests today are Joseph Newman and Michael Caine\nAches and we're talking about psychopaths [noise] one thing that I forgot to ask is how common is like apathy in other words if you take a hundred people or you know thousand people or something how many are going to get the label of psychopaths as opposed to just some people who have some emotional problems\nActually it's interesting that there because of the difficulty defining psychopathology rigorously which I Would say is you need to do something like you use a hairs like apathy checklist but you can only use that within the prison system or\nOr else using information then that lets you gauge a lot of important things about their antisocial behavior so there's never really been a community wide survey like there aren't so many other areas\nBut using a variety of information Bob hair has estimated that about one percent of the general population\nWould satisfy that criteria for psychopathology\nUm and then it's a pretty agreed upon estimate if you enter a prison system it's going to be more like Fifteen to twenty twenty five percent of the uh male population will qualify for a diagnosis of psychopathology in the female population\nMore like a six to Fifteen Percent six to ... percent of of love emails female ... thanks a lower there\nIs there call morbidity or you likely to find that if somebody um meets the criteria for like half of the they also may have one or more other mental illnesses be that schizophrenia or bipolar or Israeli nation or\nThere's nice research on that and the answer is I'm no they're not likely to have those other disorders the one the one true exception would be a substance use disorders\nWhere they are more likely to have them and the other one is the obvious or anti social personality disorders highly correlated with competing but no they're not more likely that schizophrenia depression anxiety and some people have argued they're less likely to have them\nOr their substances that are likely to bring up a psychopathic behavior\nEarly on people thought that alcohol was on a very good manager will suspect but yeah I'm In a hurry collectively who probably wrote the book the mask of Saturday which was kind of a viable in terms of the description of psychopathology I he argued that\nThat they're ... the behavior becomes fantastic and uninviting when they've had alcohol with you because it was already takes their very weak inhibitions and weakens them further\nWell can you give us some kind of basic sense says the brain differences that you're finding I realize that it's not clear cut and that there it's sort of more of a spectrum and selling that if\nNow a case that was really clear more so than usual what is it that you would see that would be different in terms of the way the brain is functioning\nWell the most some of the most pronounced differences that we've seen is in a circuit between the prefrontal cortex which is the area of the brain just behind your forehead that controls planning and rational thought and executive function\nYou and I just chime in on what we were talking about it I think I think whenever you talk about biological in brain things there's a tendency to always think this primary because biology comes before behavior but I think that one has to be careful here I think that\nYou know when Mike says what we're looking at is a lack of kind of activity in the adult psychopathic brand or one possibility is that we I think there's I think there's some evidence here is not that strong but there's some evidence that a very terrible environment can cause people to shut out\nThe way they process information actually just to be become better at ignoring things for and perhaps as a function of that acquired strategy of information processing\nThose connections become less developed or atrophy and if the if the person was a cop if he has some other problem which I personally think they too which is an attention related problem it can also lead to reduced kind of activity throughout the brain so one of the things that we might see that would be surprising\nA but I think there's also some budding evidence in this direction is if we looked at the child we wouldn't necessarily be looking for the child who has this lack of kind of activity what we might see is\nThat the the budding psychopath as there is ...\nHas the kind of activity at that point in time but then uh shows at\nLess so over to the sort of the words of it becomes sort of shut out as this person becomes heart and somehow right mhm oh yeah that's kind of use or lose it sort of\nYes or they can be sensitized if you have so much horror and your environment ... stopped responding as accurately as someone who isn't constantly around trauma\nAnd yeah and I just want to mention too there was another\nBody of narrow biological work that we can bring to bear on the sort of chicken and the egg question here and that is the study of\nNeurological patients with focal brain damage and that's in fact how I got to be involved in this at all\nSo it's part of my graduate work I Would study patients who had prefrontal brain damage\nAnd what we noticed about these patients is following their injuries they would become irresponsible with respect to their you know financial decision making and their social behavior become detached in a strange from spouses and family and friends exhibit very little guilt or empathy very little insight to any of this um [noise]\nThe word that behavioral neurologist ascribed to serve and kept slate that kind of personality changes pseudo psychopathology in other words a in a choir dysfunction to particular part of the brain seem to give rise to something in the direction of psychopathology and so that's\nI think an interesting angle that we should keep in mind when we're seeing these abnormalities is that in some cases it very much fits\nWith this neurological literature on personality change and I think it lends some credence to the idea of of what we are observing in this at least in the in the case of prefrontal dysfunction could be something that's contributing to the disorder as a as a underlying biological\nCause more likely be than like a a blow to the forehead that would affect the ... frontal ability to ah to function\nYeah you could get it through a blow to the forehead and ... and a lot of cases that results in more sort of diffuse injury I mean the the brains that are ... and the skull when you get sort of sharing of of axons and things but um [noise]\nYou see it even in cases of um like if there's a tumor that grows in that area of the brain that has to be surgically respected sometimes to stroke or hemorrhage can affect\nThat area of the brain as well and in fact that's how joined I initially got together so my research\nWas that are exploiting up [laughter] so [laughter] and um\nSo I I started working here at the university it was really um to explore and more basic questions about the neural substrate underlying emotion regulation social behavior and I studied that through these\nBrain damage patients I I was describing but they're like I said had been this connection made in the literature although there was never really any direct research you know between those two clinical populations and so upon\nYou know starting my work here you know I was aware of Joe's reputation as as you know world leader and psychopathology research I think I just sent them an email or something so do you want to\nGet together for a beer and like you know you can tell me what the psychopathic inmates are really like and I'm just through those you know really informal conversations we said well there's enough here that let's start with just some basic decision making studies and see if some of the deficits\nThat I've been observing in front of low lesion patients that Joe has been observing in psychopathic in mid sort of match up and the extent to which they correspond and we did see enough similarity that we thought well that's you know if we really want to know what's going on in the brain disease individual is when you have a good guess or where to look let's get that data let's figure out how to get that\nYou mentioned detention Joe and there's something also that the different about the response to attention\nYeah I mean maybe it'll help to bring in a personal case\nIs um such an important person in the field and he began one of his books with a a little example of this person who had participated in his study\nBut then escaped prison and a needed to support himself after he escaped and he came up with this charity scheme he was seeking money for this particular cause and he was terrifically charismatic and very intelligent and very successful at doing that\nAnd he got to make a lot of connections among wealthy people and community leaders and finally they entice them to go on television\nTo promote this charity when she gladly did and he got on and did a great job money just started pouring in following his TV appearance but so that the\nReason that the hardy and coming up and bring him back to prison and you're a it's a funny story but it it shows I think this paradox in psychopathology that\nThey seemed to have they have this mask sanity they they seem completely normal completely confident in some ways they seem super normal and devoid of the kind of a social inhibitions that make some of his awkward but\nOn top of that is this terrific oblivious in is how is it that somebody so smart\nCan go ahead and think about going on television and not put two and two together and not what the consequences are going to be but that really captures what you see in psychopathology and my approach to the field I'm throughout the entire time I've been here is to try to measure\nThat attention problem in psychopathology um and we see it quite clearly in the laboratory\nSo we can do things like have them begin a gambling games where you know you see cards on the screen and you can choose to play them and in the beginning\nYou know almost every time you respond you win but the game is rigged so that the longer you play you start to lose more than wind and you can quit the game whenever you want and a non psychopathic fender just about optimally at the optimal moment decides you know enough of this game it's going bad\nThat people would say that the they don't pay attention to changes you know they have a positive expectation about this task they've mastered it they're winning a lot and even though they're getting bombarded with negative feedback they just keep playing and in fact they lose all their money\nBut he's an attention or or just being delusional with it I mean because they're paying attention to the family\nThey're paying attention to the gambling and they're seeing the feedback and then the feedback to not having such an influence there saying maybe that's delusional and in fact back in a a Nineteen Seventy eight when an experiment like that was the first time they called it magical thinking on the part a psychopath so I think that was very perceptive on your part\nLet me give you another example though that that my view of the what appears to be magical thinking is due to some sort of attention related limitation this experiment's a little bit more complicated but it's one of the more recent things that we've done and I think it provides very powerful evidence\nUsing a very low level electric shock which we thought about very long and hard before we could do an experiment like that but we thought it was crucial to be able to to study the fear process since everybody thinks that's a\nCore deficit in psychology we did an experiment involving this electric shock that you know just feels like tingling on your finger but it's a verse of\nAnd uh we arranged the situation so that we we tell people right at the beginning of the experiment when you see a green letter you're safe you're never going to be shocked but if you see a red letter it means there's some significant chance that you will receive an electric shock\nAnd then we conducted the experiment under a let me just talk about two different conditions in one condition we really focused on the color of the stimulus we told them press one button if it's red shocked press another one if it's screens safe\nAnd then we had another condition where we said well you notice the letters can either be upper case or lower case press one letter if it's upper case press another one of its lower case so they know and in both cases reddish shocked green is safe what we found using this measure of fear protests\nUh in the condition where they're focused on the letter case\nPeople would say ... showed no fear\nThey just showed the classic fear deficit and they were significantly different than the non psychopathic offenders\nBut in the condition where we focus their attention on the red color or the green color they showed as much or more fear potential to start off as the non psychopathic subjects we've replicated that now three times and we followed it up with an imaging study\nWhere we looked at the middle of the structure that Mike was talking about earlier where people have said that's a cop and he has really due to a fundamental and make the la deficit suggesting that somehow there's a deficiency there that makes them incapable of having true emotion or fear related response is\nWhat we found in this experiment is when they saw that when they were focused on the red they showed him ... activation that was greater greater than the non psychopathic subjects but again when we focused among the letter case the amygdala activation deficit ... you know appears and you see a significantly lower and middle activation", "show_name": "University of the Air", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "28"}
