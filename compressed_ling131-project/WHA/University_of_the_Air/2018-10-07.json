W. medicine and ethics scholar up the mortgages to for research and welcome\nUniversity of the air thank you it's great to be here I'm guessing that when you speak on topics like race and genetics\nA room where people are going to find a controversial\nYes um although it's interesting because usually I'm speaking to medical and scientific audiences and it's not so much that they find it controversial as that they find it something they would prefer not to have to talk about [laughter] so we sometimes say okay now we're going to talk about the R word [laughter]\nReally but those are pretty quickly break down into something much more complex will know\nYes definitely definitely and I mean I think that's one of the the problems if you will is that people are in the scientific community you use these concepts including race and ethnicity concepts when they work and you use them in ways that work for you\nThe problem is that those are also concepts in the broader community um you know in our larger society\nSo there may not be complete overlap the ... between the way the scientists are using them and the the popular notions of\nRacial categories for instance and another problem is sometimes there is overlap and the scientists don't realize it so sometimes people start out with a kind of more formal operational definition\nBut they quickly they slide back and forth between a more formal definition that was designed for specific research project or specific medical intervention and they kind of slide back and forth into the more popular notions without always realizing that that's happening\nWell even when you're filling out forms where you have to check a certain box for race it could be problematic I have I'm a student in my class right now who is a quarter African American a quarter Cuban quarterly ocean and a quarter black with Indian\nAnd there's no space you know I mean ... what what does ... mean for student like\nThat oh yeah and I mean even you know that's that's an incredibly interesting combination and I'm sure I have a lot of friends who would love to DNA sequence that person [laughter]\nBut um yeah many people who consider themselves Hispanic that as a category that I'm officially administratively on forms um and according to the office of management and budget that puts forth these racial categories that are used on US government foreign\nHispanic is considered and ethnicity but not a race and yet in parts of this country I think we could say that Hispanic or Latino is racialized category and people who identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino\nDon't necessarily think of themselves as some other race and there's actually there are some funny stories of people um in designing census forms one of the things they discovered is that people who check the box other for race\nSomething like over Ninety percent of those people are also identify themselves us Hispanic and so they try to design those Florence to sort of push people into choosing race as well as ethnicity but still people who consider themselves are ourselves Hispanic often just check other\n... but I wondered about that and certainly ... for example to President Obama if somebody has a white mother and a blog fathers are considered black mhm they're not considered white water as well [noise]\nYou know it's a historical artifact and it's true in this country but not necessarily true everywhere so one of the things about race as sociologists and re scholars understand it is that it's\nUm it's a very valuable concept and I have a good friend who was born and raised in the Bahamas and he grew up as a white man he went to schools that were\nRight because they're very hard to cross once people have gotten across it they're just they were for a long time or for you know enough generations somewhat separated and so you can see small just continuity in terms of the amount of genetic variation that\nWhen you read in the children to use you before you between North Dakota and South Africans were closer to her friends\nAnd what if you did a comparison of you mentioned the south African and a Norwegian ... and they'll throw in an Ashkenazi Jew and a Native American from the Navajo Nation if you did a genetic comparison\nHow significant is what on the surface to us over our his our history has has made a lot of difference you know we we tend in history do have persecuted and you're treated people very differently according to what we perceived\nWas there a difference how much is that difference reflected in the actual genetics\nUm oh well you know I I'm not even sure how to answer that question I I could answer it by saying well I'm the amount of difference is much\nLess than you would see between two different groups of birds that scientists\nWho you know population biologist who look at non human organisms how the definition of races that has to do with certain amount of genetic distance between two populations at the same species so that might be two populations of birds fishes or whatever\nThe amount of difference between um a group of people a population from somewhere in Africa on a Native American population or ice\nNot so much that by the sort of traditional population biology definitions it's not enough to be called different races right so\nYou know but that's just the population biology definition I mean I guess significance depends on what you're looking at and what you care about\nRight um and so of course people who\nSeem to be genetically very closely related to each other might still find cultural differences or physical differences that to them are very meaningful and cause them to\nUm you know how long standing or groups of people might find small differences or caused them to have long standing um animosity between those groups so\nWe make meaning out of very small differences sometimes so it's you know I can sort of answer the significance question and an abstract way and and interestingly\nSo this is one of the things for geneticists for instance if they're trying to find a medically important a DNA variance sometimes\nTiny tiny tiny differences in the overall genetic backgrounds of the people they're studying my really screw up some of the contemporary\nMethods of trying to identify medically important DNA variant so if they have studied populations from gathered from one city in Sweden one city in Finland\nThey will use genetic techniques to try and find out group those people by their genetic some overall genetic similarity\nRight and they do that and they and you can do that right and you can find tiny little genetic this continuity if you will or or\nWays in which those two groups of people have slight amounts of genetic overall genetic difference that you can capture using contemporary computational methods right and that can matter for\nScientists who are doing on these sort of\nGenetic marker hunting expeditions and so they do that um and they might also do that in a way that would separate out a group of people who you know would statistically cluster a group of people who um come from\nSomewhere in Nigeria and from a group of people who come from somewhere in Italy I you\nCan also do that to separate out people in Iceland whose ancestors come from different counties in Iceland so genetically you can find teeny tiny overall differences in a little frequencies in groups and you can\nCategorize or cluster people based on those differences does that have significance anywhere else besides gene hunting maybe maybe not\nThe the technology that's been developed just recently is changing how we see raised my thinking in particular of how oh Henry Louis Gates and others have been part of this whole tracing your roots match genetically and discovering to what extent are you black and white and how how has technology changing our view the phrase\nYeah that's really very clear to me right now and so I I have to say that I have a certain amount of skepticism of some of the uh\nAncestry tracing that gets done first of all a lot of it doesn't look over whole genomes it looks it only looks at y chromosomes and what's called mitochondrial DNA\nSo what you're tracing is a lineage of the father's father's father's father if you're a male looking at the Y chromosome and a lineage of the mother's mother's mother's mother's mother going back\nSo you're not finding out nearly as much as they age you know scientists typically find out when they're doing a study um you're only finding out at tiny sliver of your ancestry and so when people do these genetic ancestry tracing\nKinds of ah activities they they need to know sort of how much of their ancestry they're really finding out about it or they might get a very skewed idea I'm\nGoing to go back and say two generations are talking about what two hundred and six team great great ... grandfather's equal number of grandmothers right you trace one of them\nOnly fighting one and eats you only finding one person than at each generation right if you go to the mother's mother's mother mother right you're only finding one percent and you're only seeing\nWhat you can see with genetics which is not evidence of every single one of them necessarily right and so this is one of the things it's genetic ancestry tracing\nThat's related to but not the same as genealogy ancestry tracing for a lot of reasons so for instance um for a while in the early two thousand one of the people who started one of these companies she had put his kids ancestry is up there\nAnd part of why he did that was to show that um genetically his two biological children didn't look\nAlike I mean they look somewhat awake right but um their PR portions of different of ancestry to different continents varied by like twelve to Fifteen Percent\nUm and that's just because it's because of a lot of things it's partly because we don't have may be the ideal references to make the kinds of claims about where your ancestors came from\nUm but it's also because of just the accents of genetics right at every\nReproduction you only inherit half of your mother's genes and half of your father's genes and I and my sister or I and my brother we don't inherit exactly the same half from the mother the same half from the father so even though we have all and exactly the same ancestors were not our genetic ancestry is not exactly like\nSo that's incest interesting but it can also be somewhat confusing and how that may or may not affect those kinds of things may or may not affect our understanding\nOf racial categories not clear how they can sometimes really\nSort of influence somebody's own understanding of themselves and who they are and where they fit in the world so people who grew up I'm being told that they were\nNative American sometimes get back results saying actually we don't see any Native American ancestry here we feel some other ancestry is here right\nUm and that doesn't really change people's ideas of the racial categories but it may change their idea of where they fit within those racial categories or it may not you know I think\nYou know some proportion of white people in this country are going to come back with a certain proportion of relatively recent African ancestry is that going to change who they think they are if in the world they've grown up way and everybody sees them as white and you know that's been the identity that they have forged over their lifetime\nI don't know that it would change them that much you know in terms of their own self conception of their position any racial classifications game\nWell it's complicated issue and we're going to look further out of the race ... justice when we return

Jim Crow laws how to do with\nExcluding blacks in the western United States there were Greece or laws and other laws that excluded um Hispanics from various schools in social services and so forth\nSo those laws did have definitions of race they vary from state to state so for instance\nIn Alabama in the early in my twentieth century Alabama in Arkansas had the infamous one drop rule\nUm but other states like Florida of rubble blood voter though one drop of black blood makes you black yes and you know that kind of viewpoint is still it's still influences are racial thinking today and that's why my friend from the Bahamas who in the Bahamas is white\nAnd the United states is light skinned black and still treated and fit as a black person in this country at least on the east coast of\nFlorida another a version of the charter soon as a country club books for bad and the woman who had black\nA black ancestor for the last five hundred years would not be admitted to the clubs\nYeah yes exactly how they'll let us let her write it off in his private discrimination um and and then people can have any set of rules that they want to and as you said how they would figure that out you know is is a whole separate question [laughter]\nUm yeah you know so at any you know at at\nSomebody might be black in one state and not black in the next state over right so you have Florida had the one eighth negro ancestry defines you as black Georgia had a law that referred to any ascertain nibble non white blood defined you as black\nRat [laughter] um and and I actually don't know I haven't done the legal research should determine what ascertain it meant ... right or who got to do the ascertain ...\nIn Maryland the law was that a person of negro descent to the third generation so looking three generations black if you had anybody black and your ancestry\nThan you are considered black right so in different states defined race different ways um and perhaps defined it different ways even for different purposes\nAnd there were interesting cases for instance California had some law having to do with access to schools at a certain point on that just excluded black people and so\nAsian and Mexican people want it to go to white schools basically and the question was under the law where they\nSince ... categories of black or what what were they well it turned out anybody not what counts as black\nFor purposes of certain laws at that time in California fried food clue where when Clinton Japanese yep anybody not wait was black for purposes of that particular law\nYeah and so I mean one of the it's one of the fascinating things when you know as a race color you talk about the contingency of race how race is very fluid and it changes\nPartly it changes on where you are and partly that's because of the laws where you are\nUm and so it is the case that somebody could have been way in Ohio and black in California or weight in Ohio and black in Alabama for instance you know an interesting thing is you know some people would say yeah but that's not really race right and that\nYou know that sort of an eBay phenomenon that's just socially it doesn't really you know get to the core of that person but of course\nIt influenced your whole identity rated influence what kind of education you got what kind of health care you get what neighborhood you get to live in you know we for you know many many years in this country and well into the twentieth century there were\nCovenants if you sold properties you were you know by contract\nHanded down with the heat of the property basically you are not allowed to sell it to people of certain races so yeah those legal designation shaped your life and materially\nSignificant ways that could shape your health shape the whole trajectory of you're earning potential in your wealth and you're off springs wealth and all of those kinds of things were going to look at health and other issues\nThat overlap with race when we continue in a moment with the University of the year\nSo before we have too much for sharing a meal together to performance but you're trying to get more than ... ... lives would go to some listening

Osorio and we are talking about race science and justice well turned to the topic of health and medicine raise sometimes gets to be a factor if we're talking about certain\nWe're Tay Sachs disease or diabetes\nHow important is it for race to be discussed when publishing a scientific study or for a physician meeting with a patient first of all I just love that question because that's the second time that so when you say Tay Sachs disease what race are you thinking about\nIs more of an ethnicity but my understanding would be the Jews were more predisposed to that genetic disease okay so now you said she thinks that I think are really fast thanks so one thing as\nYou said it's more of an ethnicity well there is evidence of some restricted you know sort of mating historically where people who identified as Ashkenazi Jewish or northern European Jewish um we're more likely to have children with each other than people who didn't identify that way\nAnd so there are some um genetic variants that are more common in people who have ancestry going back to", "show_name": "University of the Air", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "07"}
