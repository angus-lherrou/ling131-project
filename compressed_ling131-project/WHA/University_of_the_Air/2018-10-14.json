P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nOh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year you were writing\nCounting up there weren't many days till you're that you didn't even stay in the human World War one for forty years maintaining the household beer hands now that you died it will be hard to be like the past two white haired ... any part in forever and I expect my life will not last oh\nFrom the poem cycle hundred sorrows from Nineteen century Chinese poet you us I'm Emily Auerbach and this is the University of the year\nThrough a fascinating study of five generations of a famous Chinese family ranging from imperial to modern China my guests this hour sheds light on a history and culture many of us know virtually nothing about\nWhat Chinese family sometimes write poems about the dead and then bury those poems why the Chinese women sometimes burn their writings and leave men in charge of recovering their stories\nMy guests this hour as Rania Huntington professor of Chinese and the department of Asian languages and cultures at the University of Wisconsin Madison and the author most recently of ink and tears memory morning and writing in the EU family welcome to you\nI'm always interested to find out what draws someone to a particular field or topic tell me about what drew you you're from Wisconsin [laughter] not Chinese lead you to the study of\nChinese literature I'm from another time I'm is something that's very distant from Wisconsin who grew up in well I think the distance was a lot of what attracted me a\nSo yes I grew up in ... and I was fascinated by foreign languages from a very young age and I took a German and high school because it was the\nOnly foreign language offered by Wisconsin heights high school at that particular time\nAnd I loved it but it sometimes didn't feel very foreign to me [noise] so with you there's somebody ... meets with English so I was determined to try to learn a language that felt really foreign and like many people who\nDon't study Chinese I was fascinated by Chinese characters a\nAnd there was a pivotal moment in deciding to study Chinese which makes a good story a my father was at a professional conference in Oxford ah\n[noise] and while he was that his professional conference I just try and figure out I went with him on his trip and he needed to figure out something for me to do and I\nA research project that I was doing that I had went beyond what certainly the library at my high school could offer and there was a particular book that even the University of Wisconsin Madison library didn't have an English translation\nAnd I and so I said so normally a high school student\nYou wouldn't be allowed in the ... the library of Oxford nuts you don't have the status for that but when we went to the office and explain that I had an actual research task there was a book I needed that isn't available at my local libraries\nThey granted me a day's readers pass so I'm sixteen years old and I'm standing in the and the oriental studies reading room of the broadly in library of Oxford\nAnd I I've looked it up in the catalog and I have the information for the book I Need and I'm standing very timid Lee in front of the librarian who I remember as a as a stern and formidable looking middle age Chinese woman\nSaying you know this is the book I Need you know it wasn't open stacks of the book I Need and I need the English translation and she looked at me and said you don't read Chinese\nAnd I was struck of overcome was first with shame and had to say oh no no I don't read Chinese but then I thought I'm a sixteen year old white girl from ... Wisconsin\nAnd she asked it as a question she thinks maybe I could and that's the moment I decide yeah\nI'm going to Chinese someday\nSo I started trying to teach myself from a book um but I didn't really start studying till college um\nAnd then the same period I also started reading a lot of translated novels outlaw it was riding the school bus worlds concentrate along circuitous routes to school uh so I and when I had my heart set on Chinese literature\nThat's that's amazing and with your attempt to learn Chinese was it harder than you expected and was that a journey that [laughter]\nAnd how did it change you because there's always that struck me that when you learn a language you also open up different parts of your mind and think about the world and in New ways\nBut in my fatigue in my depression\nI could and I couldn't do it anymore and this was an ... pumps you waited old style edition of his work I could not punctuate the sentences so I Would read the same passage which made no sense because I couldn't break the sentences over and over and\nOver and I had it without stopping 'cause they couldn't break the sentences and it felt like you the absolute low point it's like you know I worked so hard to learn Chinese to learn classical Chinese to learn to read classical change and I can't do it anymore I Can't do it I Can't and\nYou know but that's depression right to the story depression tells you is this is the way it's always going to be\n[noise] but you know one you know\nLong story short I you know I did the depression you know the depression did break with the help of medication and some really supportive friends and family\nAnd I got back to work and I got and I and I discovered later to that oh I read that and\nSentences again why was this ever hard this is clear\nAnd I had just read his book as one collection of we're tales among many I never really thought about him what the context was for him writing it says\nBut when he I I don't even remember why I decided I'd read his press and he starts out saying oh the yuletide transcendence about\nIt's this is the little house he built for himself the cottage she built for himself next to his wife's grace and he said well after she died I couldn't do serious work because you call him a poet in the introduction and he wrote a lot of poets\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin stout offering online undergraduate and graduate degrees and professional education that certificate options for adult learners you W stout dot edu slashed WPRI\nSo I decided but it's such a habit of my life to write I still wanted to write so I started to collect these weird stories from all my friends and family and I realized\nOh oh\nYou know this book that kept me company when I was at my lowest moment she really when he was ...\nI guess that's pretty remarkable that that sense of connection then yeah and I wonder I Wonder if he wrote anything else about his wife you know or if this is the only place and then I looked and discovered oh he wrote so much\nFor her for his daughter and some of the customs that you write about in the book in terms of burying um poems or actually burning them more than bearing berries is he buried his books at one point but that\nBut that's like all of his books it's burning things that is more important knows ... odd\nThat I like his dad was viewed as a way to send than something over into the next world\nWell let me have you back it up before I I Know we've got five generations of the youth family and and so on but can you just place this the first one you and you pronounce the second and you want your way yeah you you you're\nI'm so he's born in in what year and what was the China he was born into like Ulysses born in Eighteen twenty\nOne and the Chinese and he was born into 'em\nWell people simplifying the story of Chinese history will call the Eighteenth century so the world before he was born in China is\nLack a traditional imperial China's last raised golden age yet it it ah it was the height of imperial expansion or China viewed itself as the center of its political and economic world ah it was a point of\nGreat cultural flowering\nBut toward the end of the Eighteen century there's already\nRumblings [noise] and you know the world into which he was born was one where those rumblings are getting much closer um he was a young man at the time of the opium where uh where you know China's ... where\nThere's a realization on China is part of having to deal with the western powers\nOr he was a he was a ... he was in his thirties when typing rebellion the civil war I mentioned breaks out at a restaurant or is it apart and remind me of the the circumstances of the typing rebellion well the rebellion was big it was the guy\nIn a in the southern part of China by a group of rebels who actually um had some ideas loosely\nAre derived from Christianity or in some parts are they you know they believed I'm In a say a single guy or a single God but their leader was mad at the age a younger brother of Jesus Christ\nUm and that the men choose who were ruling China's a non Han Chinese ethnic minority who conquered China or in the middle of the ... century were demons or that needed to be driven out an all of the gods\nShips were demons and their temples should be destroyed [noise] um their idea of how to get ... aspects to um opposing the foot binding a binding of women's feed 'em\nAnd you know that\nThey're they ah through you're\nGiving voice to a lot of people's ah economic discontent\nAnd some brilliant strategy you and they managed to rise from a small band of rebels to take over a large part of China and turn it in ... including\nA prosperous cities of the answer river valley I said and the changing the civil war goes on for ten years uh and the chain government does finally succeeding questioning the rebels partially in part\nBecause of infighting on the part of the rebels\nBut the loss of life is\nIn vast as fast\nAnd would you have been considered a confusion of Buddhist and he was well that's okay well that's it's all it's any confusion first and foremost a you know he is of [noise]\nSo if you wish to become part of China's ruling elite you did that by spending your life studying to pass a series of highly competitive exams that were based\nOn your knowledge of the Confucian classics and\nChina had had a great growth in the population overall enough illiterate population without a great expansion and the number of government positions that were available so it was incredibly competitive tried to pass all these levels of the exam\nAnd ... is one of the talented and lucky few who made it all the way to the top he passed the highest level of the civil service exam and it was\nAll set up for what one would presume would be a ... a prospering ... career in government\nBut then he was dismissed from office for some irregularities in the exam questions he produced when he was an examiner for one of these exams business from office till he can never serve again\nAnd so he reinvent himself instead as a teacher of the Confucian classics so he would've done it for himself as a confusion first and foremost however\nThese are not mutually exclusive data is in the China and well in China and anytime but in China of his world [noise] so he also you know confusion first and foremost but he also has an interest in both Dallas in Buddhist texts a\nAnd you know writes notes about them I mean this is what sets him apart as a scholar is he really would read\nAnything and would it would do you look at it and some of the unlikely of places for correlations to figure out things that were going on in the classics but he would put the Confucian classics at the heart is the most important part of his life and work and belief system\nYou open your book with him burying I'm One of his teeth along\nWith the use of his wife were going to talk about that when we continue in a moment when the University of the year ...\nThank you to the business sponsors who help support WPRI programs businesses like the ...

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nI'm Emily our backs\nFive generations of a Chinese family and their beliefs about writing about memory about loss you open your book ink and ... years\nWith an introduction entitled a grave for teeth a grave for books can you talk about first of all why you started the book this way and\nStrongly if we go um if we go a couple of generations forward if we go to ... grandson [noise]\nAh so I had written an article about you yeah and his wife and I thought I was done with writing about their family I thought oh you know that was very absorbing but I'm done with that um I think I I you know I can go and work on other things and I was in the library and not gene\nAnd ... is a very hot and humid city in the summer and I had to\nAnother unrelated research project on seventeenth century literature going on an add some books that I wanted to read books I wanted to see for that project\nAnd the librarians declared that you know when it's above a certain temperature and humidity level you are not allowed to look at any books that are earlier than I think Seventeen eighty you know because of the sweat off of the\nPreservation because of the humidity of the air or they you know the the the climate control sweat on your fingers that's like no you can't see the older things and then I was like oh\nWell there goes my research plan what am I going to do here in the library and I thought well\nYou know the you family they've they're always reading something what I just\nLook and see if there's anything else and I found this little book by ... ...\nMy name is first person lives second a\nAnd this was also written for his wife now one of the things that men can do morning for a woman is if that woman was a poet even for work was never published in her lifetime he could collect all of our poetry published it um you you had done this for one of his daughters\nBut ... problem was that his wife hadn't been a ... she had been a click refer a very skilled color for\nAnd so he starts collecting every scrap of paper that she wrote that no matter what it was you know reminders to do something shopping is a draft of letters\nAll of these scraps he collects\nAnd then he writes a poem about each one of the scraps has a little introduction saying this is what the scrap was an opponent by each of the scraps\nAnd then puts knocked the scraps of her writing but his poems about the scraps together into the in this small collection of poetry so they're the income cheers was very literally he was looking for any traces of her handwriting and her Inc [noise]\nAlso I think some of the descriptions make it clear that they they feel the presence of the person still that there is something a little bit oh sacred in the ink itself that yes something remains well the\nTerm or the other term as and there there's a term a\nShoulder which is like the moisture from the hammer so there's an idea that\nThat the that in the writing of the deceased people it's like the touch with their hands in the west or of their hands is still there so there is still a presence and so that was what ... was trying to capture as he collected out all the scraps that his that his wife had written [noise]\nCan you say something about the position of women in general I'm first back when the grandfather and his time with the the wife that he lost but then just in general you know you had mentioned with the rebellion kind of a rebellion against the bound feet\nYou know to what extent were women and they use family allowed to express themselves in freeways\nWell I mean they were a very traditional family uh in terms of gender roles it would have to be said ah so they you know so the traditional a division as that women are on the inside of the house men are on the outside [noise]\nAnd the women are so\nThe women of the family are highly educated and that had become a\nIn elite families particularly in their region of China that had become fairly common to that the way that the women also be educated um the\nInitial reasoning for this was the educated mothers would raise educated sons and so that's still the emphasis was on the sons and their careers\nI've but also you know educated women could\nBe parts of the intellectual lives of their very bookish husbands and sons and fathers particularly when it comes to poetry a Chinese poetry was is very social art I did it you many homes are written on occasions for particular people\nAnd you answer back by writing another poem and exchange so\nIt all the women of the family ah [noise]\nSo if you use wife yeah when you ah if she had written\nAnd had written poems back and forth to you yeah commenting on very important things in his ... when he when he passed the exam commenting when he was dismissed from office but you know for a while she had kept her home together in a collection I\nThen she burned well that that surprises me the burning of of writing especially if there's no copy or where it was a copy left behind [noise]\nShe uh well she had burned them once and then while she was alive and you managed to reconstruct them and produced a night at a nice little copy that she looked she brings them again and there doesn't there was not a copy\nSo this is one the burning of writing um you his wife does this and later his favorite daughter does this before she dies and they're older women and the family's history ... ...\nAnd this ... this is one of the the the axis of the central question in this tax why are they burning the writing\nThere is a literary model of the heroine of the the great Eighteen century Chinese novel\nOr the dream of the red chamber when she knows that her life is about the and burns the manuscript on her palms [noise] ah\nFor the motives of the individual women um some of it is seen again\nNone of them left anything in writing saying this is why I bring my homes because that in some ways is contradictory they either seems ... to be an element of run on the Asian ... one of the world you know goodbye to all of that\nThere could be some modesty because you know the women\nYou it's striking in this family that um until one of the woman who's quite late in the story\nNone of these women have their poetry published while they're alive now there are other and this is not necessarily the case for women in their society there are and soldiers of women's poets the women who've become famous poets while they're alive\nBut there's still a lot of people also like to use that the poems don't get published until after the women are dead as an act of memory by husbands sons are grandson is\nIt is so there could be as some reluctance in the woman's part that these poems were part of a living social exchange and their families not meant for publication\nAnd to bring them to avoid that a sense of modesty to keep themselves sequestered in the women's quarters to deny the men the chance to publish them I didn't fit it'd be sort of like was Emily Dickinson where she discovered publication meant\nEditors that changed punctuation at entitles you didn't choose change words could there has been a sense of control if you burn your writing no one's going to alter it or I think certainly there's a sense of control um I don't know if it was directly the fear of editors messing with it\nBut ... if it's published in circulates you don't have control over who reads it and who gets it and what they do with it and I think there was a sense um\nThere was that there was more at stake with your reputation for a woman than a man if you're writing was going around at anyone can do anything with it but in the end of it is we don't really know like what I mean once his wife's does it then will maybe his daughter is doing it\nIt's hard but it raises a difficult question about complicity on the men's part because\nYou know the men and this season starts a generation earlier this starts you know with the generation of ... a father who only appears in the prologue who has a wife who is only marriage you for a very brief time before she dies and he knows she was a poet\nAnd after she died she goes looking for a poetry and there's none of it she's she's eliminated all of it\nYou it especially in the case of his daughter ah\nYou know why did you yeah not think there's a risk of this I should keep it clean copy of her work right why ...", "show_name": "University of the Air", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
