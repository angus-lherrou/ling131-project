Madison\nWelcome to university the air thanks for having me here\nLet's start with a definition of miracle what does it have to have in it can be a miracle\nI think I've miracles is requiring two properties the first is that\nThey have to be extremely improbable\nIf something were to happen over and over again day after day I don't think people would regard this as a miracle secondly I think that miracles have to be caused in a certain way so lots of events are extremely improbable\nBut it's only when they're so improbable that we think that they have to have a supernatural caused typically divine cause that we think of the event is a miracle\nAnd what brought you as a philosophy professor to write about miracles even talk about miracles\nAs a philosopher I'm I'm trained to reason and it pains me to see people reasoning poorly just as a nutritionist might not like to see people eating fatty foods or an environmental conservationist might not like to see people leaving lights on in their house\nIt really hurts me to see people reasoning poorly especially about something that's so central to so many people's lives\nSome people you know do have these justified beliefs and one thing or another and how do you distinguish between that and the miracle\n[noise] the issue of justified belief is is really important what I'm arguing and this and this book I'm writing is not that there have been no miracles I I don't take a stand on that is that people aren't justified and believing that there have been miracles\nWill hold on let me get the distinction they you're saying it's OK to believe in them or they may have that you don't know if there's been miracles that we we can't believe in them\nI unofficially have a view on whether there have been married for ... ... of my book it's fine with me if if miracles have happened my claim it's just about whether we can believe that they happen so [noise]\nI don't know whether there's extra terrestrial life there may be there may not be than a separate question is whether we're justified and believing in such things as as extraterrestrials\nThat's kind of an interesting one that you begin with Larry because\nI mean rationally if you're just looked at those statistics there has to be extraterrestrial life you know as Carl Sagan would say their billions and billions of planets out there are similar to earth that could you know create life where where life would spontaneously created self\nEven though we may never have actually seen that are logic tells us that it must be there that's almost the opposite of a miracle is new\n[noise] well I'm I was interested in drawing a distinction between\nWhat might really exist and what we are justified and bleeding really exists I I agree with you that um I think there's good reason to think that there has extraterrestrial life but they're quite a few people who believe in is what's called a fine tuning argument that suggests that uh\nThe likelihood of life evolving anywhere starting anywhere but on earth is so small that we can't be justified and believing it but we can change the example and I can talk about questions about\nWhether a there's a\nPiece of gold silver buried in the earth that weighs four times a ... ton nugget of gold I have no idea whether there is and uh if I wanted to be justified and believing that there is I should find some evidence for ... I Believe\nWhat about the argument that life itself on this universe is miraculous that if he just contemplate this sort of incredible vastness of the galaxy or the intricacy as bacteria in many different kinds of species\nWhat a miracle be applied when that doesn't work out so well and the and that's very unlikely that it would not work out phosphorous and theologians\nDiffer about whether there can be bad miracles so does that shunned by the devil is certainly not unusual occurrence [laughter] and uh it's caused by something supernatural but I don't think anyone would regard possession by the devil is a miracle lots of people who believe in miracles thing that they have to be\nSigns of of God in God's another once I'm partying of the red sea it worked out well for the humor is but not so well for the Egyptian right well yes a little bit depends on your point of view does ... ... and if you when you get to write the history yeah\nSome miracle is pretty much all as positive as ordinary ah Christians and Jews think miracles they tend to be good for them\nWhat are some of the earliest examples of people referring to miracles I think for as long as we have recorded history if people were talking about miracles so\nCertainly the ancient Greeks believes in miracles or divine interventions and uh about the time that that a Christ Jesus Christ was walking the earth people believed in all sorts of miracles a that Jesus did fantastic things was\nSort of not unexpected given all the sorts of fantastic things that others were doing at the same time which is I think a reason to be skeptical about the kind of testimony that um the New Testament presents on behalf of miracles\nAre there any religion that don't have miracles because I was just trying to think of any of the major religions that don't have some kind of divine intervention or something that you would count as as a miracle\nA not very confident about this but I think I read that Islamic\nAre we one of collectively speaking here has humans less likely to believe in miracles today and if so is this how to do with just a greater emphasis on science [noise]\nI Would have hoped that is true but it turns out that that's not true there is a recent Pew poll surveying people on their beliefs about about miracles and about religion and\nFour out of five Americans believe in miracles is is across the board at doesn't divide people Democrat Republican and it doesn't divide them north south it doesn't provide them by an educated\nNon educated it's across the board that same poll getting back to the point I made about I'm believing things simply because you want to believe them the St Paul asked the question whether people believed in heaven and about Seventy five or eighty percent people said yes\nBut did they believe in hell and now it's about fifty percent now well that those like human nature is on me [laughter] yeah I mean what can explain the difference the evidence for one ought to be about as good as the evidence for the other so it sounds to me like they believe in having me as they want there to be one\nRight but that's no reason to believe but you must get a lot of flak when talking about this subject from pretty much anyone who had has been deeply held religious belief\nOr is it tied into discussions in the Bible um how would you argue as to why it's important from your point of view that they not believe in miracles\n[noise]\nUm I mean in ... in other words mhm well you know just the way we've we've got Santa Claus around and and you have to sort of have this at at what point do you kind of\nPull the curtain in saying there is no Santa Claus and and with miracles what is it that you see as a danger for people who for the four out of five uh-huh Americans who\nBelieve in miracles why does the danger\nI don't know that there's a danger I think we owe it to ourselves as rational agents to ah try to support the things that we believe and we're making we're failing in some way if if we don't do that but also think about\nThings that really matter to you so you're sick and you go to see a doctor and doctor gives you a diagnosis which isn't a happy one\nAnd now you might wonder should I trust this doctor or you want because the diagnosis is so important to your life you want to be sure that the diagnosis is correct and so\nThe more important this diagnosis is the more you should want justification for believing that the doctor has identified a disease correctly [noise]\nWell I think that for many people religion is very important that's a very important feature of their lives they structure their lives around it they educate their children and the and they and the beliefs of their religion they pass legislation that\nMight prevent women from having abortions because of their religious they might think that gay marriage should be forbidden because they're religious so these this is her beliefs that have affects not just for them but for others\nSo you'd think that's something so central in the lives of these people would be at least as worthy of justifying as a diagnosis from a doctor\nWho gives some sense as to how necessary miracles are to a religious belief when we return of the moment because as University of the air\nThank you to the business sponsors who help support WPRI programs businesses like pine valley

by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n... back with Emily Auerbach and our guest Larry Shapiro who is raising the question are there are miracles\nWhen I think of Christians in particular and Darwin coming along at Eighteen fifty nine and increasingly the evidence after Darwin convincing people Christians included\nThat to God did not create the universe and man in the course of a week but that this was a long continuous process and what I think about how a religious people\nAdjusted their thinking to accommodate the new discoveries I have to wonder in the long run how necessary as a belief in miracles of all for a Judeo Christian\nFaith miracles say really happen\nGreat evidence for God that remove the miracles and on what basis do you believe in God well there are a number of arguments for God's existence that don't depend on the existence of miracles but [noise]\nOf Earth Day thousands of years of scrutinizing these arguments they haven't held up too well so miracles might be sort of the most accessible and best kind of evidence for God's existence so I think if you don't believe in these things you're going to have trouble holding your belief well however\nAre in in Christian religion and I'm sure others to\nThe emphasis is not on that which has demonstrated buddy and faith and belief in jumping that gap you can't see it\nBut we're asking you to believe that and if you start with the premise that well you exist in the first place obviously something happened other than you to make that happen and if you're just say well I think there's more of an Eighteenth century concept it exists you're part of it\nAnd it doesn't mean that God's gonna come in and help you to win the lottery or anything but if you have this kind of sense of who you are where you fit in the scheme of things you can\nYou can survive in this world and you get that sense of who you are by developing some kind of a relationship with whatever you want to call it creator large see little sea\nAnd the universe and then your whole place and so I mean you really have to believe that God is going to come in and help you win the lottery or even ... child in order to have that kind of belief\nNo I don't think so I think um if you want to believe in God and are satisfied believing in God without the evidence of miracles than welcome to it it's not it's not a kind of practice that\nI can come into being a philosopher who's looking for reasons to believe but if people want to do that they can do it I mean one one thing to say about\nYour question do we need to need miracles to believe in God we might also ask do we need God to live their lives I mean what what if it happened to be that a a Jesus was not really resurrected that Jesus was crucified is buried in a town\nThree days later people went looking for him and they opened the wrong tomb and it was empty or the body has been stolen or the body of insulin and suppose that it happened\nWould that mean that all he had taught that this report in the gospels it's false or doesn't prescribe a good form of life that doesn't seem to matter whether he was divine are not\nWell right I mean I've heard people say over the years you know I read the Bible not because I Believe it's literally true but because I Believe the parts of it at least give me a good\nAs you say I mean you couldn't believe the precepts without believing that they are somehow divinely given\nThat's right and uh would that we all live better lives [laughter]\nWhat about the phrase that you hear a lot and that is the miracle of creation\nSometimes people use is just to refer to the ordinary consequences of unprotected sex [laughter] other times they use this expression to talk about the origins of life\nFact that sometimes people\nAre pronounced dead and then it turns out they're not or you know that that line between life and death is not is finite and as clear as we'd like to think it is um I mean do you think that some of that gets factored into when you have all these accounts of someone who returned from the dead or\nWho would either now yeah I just did this sort of feeling I Can't believe she survived what a miracle because it does happen where it seems like someone's had gone and then they're back yeah\nWe refer to these things as miracles I think what we really mean as\nWe're really happy that something really rare just happened so we hear about people recovering from stage for cancer\nNow stage for cancer is of course terrible and I'm the prognosis for recovering from stage for cancer is very small but it's very small it's not impossible and so sometimes\nA lucky few will recover from stage for cancer someone will always win the lottery yeah how'd you may not ... but [laughter] but there will be a winner somebody will win and it will be a very very long shot that they do\nWater marathon yeah they will but they won't have in mind what I have\nA line for an miracles and we continue in a moment with the University of the year\n...\nYou're listening to home is where the hardest by Peter Paul and to me she was she cleans this week I simply folk will enjoy a conversation with no pulse spooky alone with plenty of sounds for the beauty of bottom tonight at five pm he had was public radio\nAnd I named my in\nWisconsin Public radio is a place for great stories news from around the state and so much more there's always something new to discover and membership support helps make it all possible you can see our program schedules at WNPR dot org\nMentally our back back with Norman ... our guest is Larry Shapiro we're talking about wonder of wonders if the last guy to thinking about miracles that's the title of your luck in progress tell us about that title lender of lenders [noise]\nWell I grew up loving fiddler on the roof or self though the wonder of wanders was easy to come by of course that's that's referring to miracles and the phosphorus guy to thinking about miracles to the subtitle I Hope would would catch the interest of people who\nWonder what these phosphorus are all are all about what is that we spend our time doing and how might a philosopher or put a perspective on thinking about miracles\nEither categories of miracles any have you sort of look at all these different miracles that have been reported and you know are the ones that involve health ones that didn't involve appearances of the I mean do they fall into kind of recurring themes\nYeah there are there they're raising of the dead there are healing Z there are things like stigmata and a crying statues\nAppearances appearances visions I'm\nSo there are sort of classifications and I I think you know the Vatican has a team prepared to\nTo to fly off in an instant to investigate a miracle and I think they've had they've actually only officially approved of one crying Mary statue is miraculous\nHappened in Japan and the Nineteen seventies recent\nKennedy ... the preamble to sainthood miracles required at a recent ones come to mind other than weeping statues all others that one up in Green Bay right now that involve the presence of of Mary\nAnd I'm yeah this is very famous famous uh like they learn slower feeling yeah exactly and then I mean how does visions qualify as miracles obviously you have to have more than one person experiencing division\nMhm but is there are\nSome kind of a an inference valid in for instance says oh it's got to be marry when you see when you read about what are these visions not a valid and friends there people make the in France but\nThe thing to say about I think visions and uh other settings like this we want to know why is that people are reporting these things if they didn't really happen I think\nI think that's a really maybe quest shot they happened yeah they certainly thought that they happen and then we can ask well why do they think that these things happen and that's the crux\nOver matter I mean is it that if you think something\nI'm In mind is a very creative but we're talking about a collective thing no I've heard instances where\nMiners in cave in\nSort of had collective visions mhm but\nI've never heard of explained psychologically unless unless somebody says oh I see this and that somebody else oh yeah I think I see a too but uh if this was going to be the Green Bay or the words are really well we're going to be somehow verified by the Vatican which has an interest in the ... things that aren't\nMiracles sure how\nAre they going to set up criteria that are going to say clearly you saw you saw you saw\nI think that um they can't and I think that's for a reason that the foster David him spelled out a few hundred years ago cameras considering these reports about miracles and he asked\nUs to really interesting question it's kind of obvious on reflection but that's a big impact on on the literature and how people think about miracles so\nImagine you have someone testifying to the uh occurrence of a miracle someone says that they had a vision or number of people had a vision you now have to waste some probability so\nAnd the one hand it would be strange if what this person said was false because people generally don't tell faucets people will try to tell the truth so it's kind of unusual that someone would say something falls\nBut um we also have to ask about the likelihood that this miraculous event really occurred\nSo and the one hand we have this unusual circumstance of someone saying something pause and the other hand we have this unusual circumstance of a miracle happening and then we have to do a kind of balancing act what's what's less likely is it that a miracle happened or is it that\nThis person said something false and it seems like it's the person says something false would you still done I'm Sorry that it's more likely that someone say something falls then that America will actually explain what they sat\nThrough of more than one person claiming to experience ... was a little bit about it\nYou've got a dozen miners trapped in a mine they all report a vision what's the division of well maybe they all see Mary something like that and now we have to ask ourselves what's the chance that Mary actually appeared to these miners I'd say it's really small\nSay there was no way to know whatsoever [laughter] really small though right you can agree with me on that doesn't happen too often so doesn't ... doesn't happen often really really small\nNow you got twelve miners trapped in a mine being oxygen deprived starved\nPerhaps praying together sensory deprivation to mhm perhaps praying singing chanting together whatever now what's the chance that these miners are reporting having a vision won some vision didn't really happen\nWell it's I think bigger than the chance that Mary actually appeared [laughter]\nWell William Blake said I'll deities reside in the human grass and if you have these miners all coming from the same religious background and having images in their head and if it's ... and then and everything they could have a picture that comes to mind well\nYeah so that would be another way of explaining the phenomenon which I think is more likely explanation then thinking that Mary actually presented herself\nIn the town says just pure\nWho set out to say come look at this miracle and and it's it's just a hoax it's just that you know cheap trick\nWell there was this profit instead of going yeah yeah yeah of course there there have been a tricks involving crying statues and things like that sometimes there's condensation that explains these these sorts of uh appearances but sometimes people just liked to pull on over there [noise]\nOver on someone else but I'm related to this argument I was just making about the miners and Mary's an important point that\nThe more improbable the event that you're considering the better your evidence has to be for believing it explodes so let me let me give you an example which I think it's pretty startling suppose that you went to your doctor and your doctor told you that um you had a rare disease\nAnd he knows this because he had given you a test which is Ninety nine point nine percent reliable meaning that I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "University of the Air", "city": "Madison", "day": "21"}
