national coming out this past Thursday October eleventh\nWe're looking at some big moment in coming out history and here it's coming out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas just talk me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that history without talking about this one big moment\nYeah it was a big deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll her a lot that's Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on her ABC sitcoms [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThat's right\nI remember this year I was like\nThirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch wow that make them ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show or a therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter]\nOh God I ever had old remember\nExactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special\nSomebody you know that I I click with and obviously you didn't click with Richard has there ever that anyone you felt you click with\n\nAnd what was his name is [noise]\nThey both for younger [laughter]\nAnd and I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen\nNo normal I mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house and picket fence you know Don cat Sunday barbecues and when I Love someone who loves me and I can build a life with just I just want to be happy\nAnd you think you can't have these things with a woman\nWell as I had a pretty big problem with it you know there there are a lot of people out there who think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades and run the backlash that she face was pretty hectic last a show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show and we see actually\nPut an adult content warning on episodes of Ellen that showed a woman kissing a woman [noise]\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and I'm so in April in Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just gotta here\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people of course a lot of gay people are like that\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best to present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids or you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue\nOr the only right thing to do was embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible bigger\n[noise] it's so funny she says there's an agenda your to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah there was a part of\nThe whole he hate kids it's okay you can try to uh it was fascinating to hear because of course what they were terrified about that it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um [noise]\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly\nAnd can I jump to a ... and I know we're going decade by decade I'll go ahead but you know a ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it I'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs wind up here um and he sets off of brain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says\nDon't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out\nIn the ... gone from Nineteen Ninety seven Ellen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do it academic they don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay\nSo for one and this is debatable\nAmerica is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nYou know I'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it they don't whereas like heterosexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out or no one should\nMaybe heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now\nYou know and you think of the R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never use the word gay right you know you think about Jodie Foster mostly kind of came out a Globes we actually have paper that\nYou know I'm just getting out there right loud crowd right so I'm I'm In Egypt support on [noise]\nI Am a\nI already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the\nOpen up the trust of friends and family co workers and then gradually proudly to everyone who knew her everyone she actually\nNow apparently I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life without press conference a fragrance at a friend's I'm\nGoing to go to have a point should we be forced should anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out\nYeah and see this is where we go back to it being both a personal any political choice\nAnd I think the personal has to come first and I think that you don't you and I know the the list is celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know amount\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with it much like for us to did um and then for whatever reasons whether it's familiar will\nUm whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know they decide not to where they don't yet or they wait\nSupport for WPRI comes from the Green Bay Packers hall of fame

than just this past Thursday October eleventh was already at national coming out day mark that day we are exploring coming out I Would never just one day\nAnd how it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with e Patrick Johnson you the head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people brown people and there's people whoever\nWhere you live a gay life\nBut you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day where you tell everyone hopes no and and and my other folks don't [laughter]\nThis feels to me to be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white am I right than a yes yeah and yeah and if you are already\nHailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your rights or a black person I like the next person Asian person\nAnd that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have any choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it and I especially feel that way I'm for African Americans in particular because of the connection to the church mhm you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and not\nFind a gay man ... a whole ... of them yes um\nAnd it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my own and out of work I mean like I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of\nCorrect but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm there was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there yeah I mean the church is where I was encouraged to um\nExpress myself which I was a big clean love 'em and and the choirs than\nA singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos section and I'm sure that ended up I'm sure they loved it they should be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell and God gave you age because you're saying yeah well not in my church that I got that right [laughter]\nBut many charges were doing but many are absolute and still do and ... and so yeah it's a really a\nConcert [laughter] life yeah no but that's that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low yeah phenomena and also we should stop to define what the downloads for those who might not know\nYes so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men who do not attend a fight as gay and they're usually black and only ... yell for men other than black men yes I'm even though that's not true [laughter]\nWell I mean like ... for like white men but they were living in a life that lead a double life yeah\nWhat does it say about\nWhat coming out has become where you move from Harvey Milk in the seventies coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time this subset of the community black man\nIs still being labeled with this term deal so at the same time that yes there was a ...\nOpen there was another part that was actually being\nVery open Jay in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of of black in Latin next lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that we are pushing back against the second wave feminist movement\nWas white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lowered a surreal Morocco Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these black lesbian yeah and legitimate lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history has not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision [laughter] but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people\nTake on ... rye is there another listener who share to coming out story with us on a as twenty five from Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago and he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but he has a second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my classes on my professor had brought in a trench she was a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story that guy as like raise to be only strong and like you know soft and\nUm and I always felt like something was wrong but like compensated by eating like in the military and I got a wife and kids like all this stuff and I never gave myself face to really like\nAsk myself and really like think\nAbout who I Am [noise]\nI was like back in my chair that my oh is that in class and I'm just kinda mulling over another like giving yourself space\nOr something [noise] I've never done that before interesting and sort of put his myself that question I was like okay well I Am I on and and I like unless fell out of my chair [laughter] because unlike the answer was no [noise]\n\nNot even recently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy on his parents got really hung up on that\nThey kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an aesthetic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't like it was not my body and everybody like things about their body reached oh like make our way through life and we just have to learn to love ourselves and it was like well\nThere's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body part and like I don't know like something feels like\nGenuinely wrong and so I\nKind of made it clear that like\nIt doesn't matter if you understand her and I felt like it does matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and that was something that\n[noise] yeah the other day they were like that are good night and then as the going off to that and my dad called out after me and say like well again tonight and thanks for being yourself\nI mean maybe\nBut\nI'm Still there and um yeah I mean on each other\n\nThat was on a writing limit Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Elon did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to\nLike Janelle Monet a as an example because she didn't come out as gay or it was something much more fluid and I think we're in a moment of trans news\nAnd gender non conforming aid that is really influencing how people announced their sexuality and so it's much more ... than a\nI'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like well", "show_name": "On Your Money", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "13"}
