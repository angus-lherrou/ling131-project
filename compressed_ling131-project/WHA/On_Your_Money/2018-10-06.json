I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nI work all hiding in a corner or near an all [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys night where did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school in shirts for it to you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond fond\nFont thoughts of my days he's hiding in the corner at\n... at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah [laughter] deserted in story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\n... opportunity when together or we didn't have to get together but\nWe did it so you want it to run on the homecoming court as a cane but at the school administration told her that only boys can be teens and only girls can be queens\nCivilian and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day\nThey decided to have no gender the titles in the homecoming contests no canes know queens everyone on the homecoming court would just be known as quote royals but\nThat didn't make the soda and story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just the day and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting tricks you regard I got to churches whether or not they were now that the king\nOr queen or anything on the train and it\nWas up to that it was in school and we're going to take out come on circuit check out check in one couple I'm sure I'm gather\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as el GB teach you plus since the change the sodium story happened dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much ... than ... ... we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it it ... what home coming to post about 'em outside Austin order hearing about it the comment I Am not very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat I'm actually a chick ... saying that we're that we're not we're snowflakes rational or special treat ball and that that is exactly what they would have expected to electing a same sex couple is that they are and how come back with yeah\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming\n... and it up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well like is there are going to be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next\nHi yes actually that one of the teachers that has been talking joy throughout this whole issue mentioned like off ... she was but and I can't wait till we get to ... ...\n... and how that turned out my goodness so there may be more drama ahead before the years done [laughter] please [noise]\nThese two young women Sicilian stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support them others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made\nMe think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be\nConfusing for some people I I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the the\nThat I'm getting older and I'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and I mean we could have been having the same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like\nThey're trying to be
