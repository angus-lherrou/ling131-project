in fact I Know both\nThe candy it's for that and in New York is there a sour patches and so is Massachusetts yeah basically you know they let me you know the ... well I don't know if it was a ... or something but there was one that had Idaho have a Ninety light as the favorite candles\n[laughter] daddy like\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy or movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer or there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up each other\nMiserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girl private love letters from mysteriously males to Oliver crush it I think it's really cool that you think I have a cold and spent my eyes\nTo let us around\nAnd there was this other one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her strange father\nGot credibly drunk that night and I must them blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what I mean the\nFun thing about all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved before and like father have you ever watch any of those movies very okay which took I\nWatched um television before of course so good and set it up yes letter I used to love lovely I feel retro about them I feel I feel like it stokes a particular part of by heart\nSame same so these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get the scribe has to watch romantic comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love\nKnife or and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that tens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of love very closely\nHer name is Gwen I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me to bricks and yet I haven't been ... out for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly\nThis summer I Know you didn't even now [noise]\nUm they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love with like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even\nNumber of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching his rom coms my big question and first question about all of this was like what led Netflix snow or think\nThat rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take to rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in the editors so knowing that trend line what may Netflix they will just might work for us\nI think they just spied a completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book critic shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them\nYeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters why they left rom coms\nWrit large I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars back\nChannel with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put ground with anybody like this one was on dribble up next why not [laughter] but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon and Vince vaughan and for Christmases and it tanked yeah and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband than to go on to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms honor and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars and see a lovely couple ended up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going out to\nUm should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms an actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about\nCrazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see either and in the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nAnd because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like more depressed were were stressed out we want escapism\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned operated and argued over since Nineteen eighty proud supporter of independent fault whether that's

and wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids\nWe've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show\nMe too and politics me too in Hollywood be two in journalism and NPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports and the dozens of stories you've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people they should be able to trust\nReality is causing a great deal\nSupport for WPRI comes from west gone some credit union offering express loans personal loans for ATVs snowmobiles and other recreational vehicles we belong to you information is at ... dot org\nWords doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university ... Nassar was originally sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job for less than a week ago today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater Brady barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and\nSo he helps drive my teammate and I to and from practice which both of our families really appreciated and so anti would almost pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to the rink and scape but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rink and skate than\nThere was molestation that happened before and after I mean and the rink parking lots of high school parking lot\nReady was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year olds Olympic medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThen I mean I can picture clear as day back out of our driveway go down the street stops I take a right and you go to my house and it was like that every time and then one time at that same stop sign he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end\nWhich in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took office he found he turned to me and he said can I guess you would have had that moment I said nothing I just sat there and\nUm I Will sit here and honestly say I did not say no and out into art and not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's free and that's what happened and I remember\nAfter that when we put our seatbelts out and turn the car out and I remember just being like five or a\nI mean now now we have an especially I was like W ATF yeah you know and like shocked Robert Tonner present\nAnd only him how would I tell\nAnyone who would believe me what proved to have why would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just um and it wasn't violet\nIn what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan you know all that\nThat we pretend to make these people will be so yeah that I mean honest to God that is a day of my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in in the ... the the contact become more intense\nAs yeah so so people will say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on\nAny I never had sex and the\nTraditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was he wrecked um [noise] and you are touched\nAnd I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy just taking advantage of you\nDo see also like getting close to your family at the same time I'm very much so so ah\nHe [noise] he had um a growing issue skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom\nOh my goodness yeah so have you and your house for now wasn't from their mother you knew what he was doing to you she did not\nKnow how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of confusion and\nI was so dedicated to wanting to skate that\nI didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have any\nAnything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em anything the only thing that he wanted\nFor me was my ... and fly body um and um I thought it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me and he took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming\nAmir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something there not straight they're bent to go left and the offset\nAnd so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement Curtis is pretty steep as a kid and so I'm\nAs you're getting better that all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight or ... trials surgical winner club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training programs sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a fulltime job\nAnd a family um he and he took care of my blades and I mean our coach Andy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to a skating\nFind a ride to the rank\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else it could be your\nUm because he was kind to me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean so things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second\nI I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns in the summer that's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute it's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids yeah right but\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long\n... two things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I wanted to go with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away and um he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm\nSo long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go on after party I can go to anything I had to come directly home\nAnd so I told the group of friends I was going with than my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing and I go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured that it fine\nBut it was because he was controlling yeah\nWhen I told my parents mom we pick me up you know the station ... station wagon a role in my school parking lot to pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those memories in my brain", "show_name": "On Your Money", "year": "2018", "city":
