here with two gas at NPR West Karen Grigsby Bates correspondent for NPR's Code switch team hey Karen hey Sam\nAnd Kelly McEvers host of NPR's embedded podcast hello Hi quick question for both of you before we get back to the news\nUm have either have you ever been to Nebraska for fun kind of\nWhere I'm I drove the length of the state and\nUm I remember it being the parts that with two very beautiful Kelly yeah see I already grew up in the cornfields and the ... so I'm now [laughter]\nSo I bring this up because the state of Nebraska is out with a new ad campaign to boost tourism to Nebraska but their whole sticking point is that the state is boring and that's why you should come\nAt it this year right yeah you know are you worn out by the chaos that you see it right now that I'm gonna rat's ass literally underground and\nTheir slogan in one ad is lucky for you there's nothing to do here\nI think that's genius [laughter] I think they should tell people to take that take a drive through the ... you know like yeah they like the Internet turned off as soon as you could ask as we ain't got no I've I Know a lot of it yeah social media like coming up yeah\nJohn Rick's runs Nebraska's tourism commission and he talked to NPR on Thursday unexplained with this campaign is all about\nNebraska is a place where on his perspectives and life simple pleasures help you realize what matters most\nYou know I never had any desire to go to Nebraska now I'm going\n[laughter] I'll do it in ... and somebody's front porch and I want a vet that person first [laughter] yeah that I I don't care about the conversations that tie\nYeah All right in other wacky news I Want us to talk about a story in academia and the strange fight happening in that world over the last year or so\nThese really crazy studies have started to show up in some peer reviewed journals one was a study about rape culture at Portland dog parks among dogs\nAnother study argue that professional bodybuilding is bigoted because it doesn't include a category for quote fat body building\nAnd then another study replaced anti Semitic phrases in Hitler's mine comes with feminist buzzwords yeah so all these studies are part of a big hoax fake studies placed in real journals to show that a certain type of scholarship is corrupting academic research\nThese ... call it grievance studies they associated with fields that are focused on identity like gender studies are clear studies are critical race theory\nI had to get to the bottom of this so I called up one of the three ... hello Jens Lindsey hello he's a mathematician\nMy background is in what's called ... which sounds already [laughter] hard it's it's basically solving puzzles\nAnd I had a lot of questions for him but first I had to understand what he means by the phrase grievance studies\nStudies is this is a little bit of a complicated term because people think we're talking about particular fields or subjects and that's not correct grievance studies is something that double method that is an approach to studying certain things to be really\nMission would be the definition for what is formerly known as critical constructive ism which is this idea that\nSociety is built out of power dynamics that are regulated in language\nAnd so the studies come from a position of not just say social marginalization or pressuring or search for equality but rather one of actual grievance where they believe that the system is rigged against them and they're frustrated with that\nSo James and two colleagues of his Helen plug grows and Peter but go Asian they got seven out of twenty of these hoax studies published now we should note here all of these hoaxes or self described liberals and James says all of this reveal something wrong with left wing academia\nWe care about how these topics are covered and were sick and tired of looking at this political circus that's dominating our political landscape right now okay we figure we feel like the left has looms the right has ... and we're on the left we need to clean up the left and we hope the rights to do it too\nYeah and just to narrow down on that when you say these topics and things like gender studies square studies ray studies that kind of area\nYes exactly a gender studies that say race gender sexuality um anything to do with identity really needs to be done right and needs to be done carefully and he's been rigorously\nAnd it needs to not leave a vacuum into which I'm said the right wing pundits can can fill the space and and gain traction gotcha\nSo I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this and want to kind of make it digestible I hear you saying that some Wayne because in the fields of gender studies course studies ray studies have gone too far and that you wanted these hoax studies to prove that\nYeah ... ... in a sense what we wanted to prove was that they are relying upon broken methodologies that allow them to launder ideas through the scholarly process so they can start with some opinion or even a prejudice and push it through the scholarly process because there seem to be flaws and how that materials being evaluated by the peer review system\nAnd then it comes out looking like knowledge on the other side\nGotcha so then what did you want these hoaxes to accomplish it do you want to diminish these fields of study do you want certain scholars to go away do you want certain journals to go away what did you want to tangibly happened as a result of these studies I\nWould like to see the scholarship on these these topics which is incredibly important being done better I'd like to see rigorous work done where where criticism that comes from the outside and outside and says hey you know this methodology doesn't work or this blatantly disagrees with with what we know about biology\nI Would like to see it to where these fields which do this camp reply oh you're just speaking from a sexist or racist perspective whenever you try to challenge her ideas yeah so I'm looking for reform not destruction how many hours a week or were you working on this\nI personally put in between Thanksgiving and when it came public in October this year I personally put in about Ninety hours a week\nProbably on average where you're not working out doing this and if so how are you making money [laughter]\nFor the first half of the project I kept my day job and it became increasingly difficult to keep up with both and the stress was enormous and it was very difficult uh over the course of the study we actually had a number of anonymous donors reach out to us how they find you\nUm well we aren't completely disconnected from the world and Peter and I had done a previous hoax attempt called the conceptual peanuts it was a social construct and various people had been aware of this they've asked to be to remain anonymous obviously\nThe nature of how controversial stuff can be ... if it matters more money came from left donors then right donors\nNoted what is it or something like well\nWe figured that there would be a lot of pushback and there's actually been a lot more encouragement you kind of see some scholars are pushing back against it and saying that we were mean which that's irrelevant even if we're not but even if we were but it wouldn't mean anything they're saying we're tools of the right which is also falls\nWhile she was in prison [noise] with all us how did it in his sister would tell us how she got out\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR

minute from NPR I'm Sam Sanders we're going to have a conversation now about a movie I cannot stop talking about it's an HBO documentary called the ... the sentence is about Cindy shape a mom who had three kids husband home are pretty\nNormal life but it all changed one morning when the feds came knocking the arrest him Cindy for something she was involved in years before an\nEx boyfriend had been a drug dealer and because she knew what he was doing and didn't report it she was committing a crime\nMandatory minimum sentencing laws for certain drug offenses meant that Cindy was sentenced to Fifteen Years in prison\nThis movie is about Cindy struggle to get out and to struggle to keep being a mother to her three young daughters while she was in prison and the whole movie is directed by Cindy whose brother Rudy vile death he actually began filming the day Cindy went to prison\nAnd found a life of my daughters um I was given a sentence of Fifteen Years in two thousand and eight and my daughters were for two and six weeks old and Rudy starts to film their lives and if it films what actually happens to families that are left behind on these um\nLong sentences in what happens what truly happens to families\nYeah ... ... ... and these long sentences like there is a name for this kind of sentence the mandatory minimums we should explain briefly what the idea of these minimum is and how some folks say it has hurt families like yours yeah I\nMean they're all you know products with this war on drugs that started in the late seventies early eighties where the sentences which would have been posed based on weights and based on different criteria when you're facing a drug sense especially on the federal level\nAnd I'm a lotta people refer to what happened to my sister as the girlfriend problem yeah which is basically you know she was knowledgeable about what was happening in you know the household she was living in but she didn't go to the police and you know ... she was sentences if she were the person actually buying and selling the drug to\nWhat exactly had your ... your um your ex boyfriend been doing lay out the case for us\nWell um he had he was a drug dealer and he had started selling drugs in when after we started our relationship and he was actually murdered and that is when the federal government came across everything that he was doing\nAnd they initially indicted me in two thousand and two and dismiss my case why did to dismiss it they you know the feds picked up they dropped it state picked it up state dropped it and I got a letter from my attorney saying that my case had been dismissed\nUm it was really trying time at that time 'cause the birds you know it was quite a world one with the murder and then be in charge initially and then you know I moved out with my life and\nBut my life back up put my pieces back together and then only to have them come back later and\nTake me away cheers later and and so what did they actually convict you up I Know it was some kind of conspiracy charges like what was the the formal sentence\nI was actually given um for felonies or we'll charge 'em with possession within tend to distribute a cocaine crack marijuana and also conspiracy I was charged with all of his current\nWhen they came to you years after\nAfter you moved on to start a new life with a new husband children of your own [noise] when they said we're going to lock you up did you think that any sentence would be fair or do you think this and then you to prison at all was wrong\nYou know I I've gotten asked this question quite a bit and it's hard for me to say 'cause it's me out and you know I don't want to go to ... you know I understand that you know people make a choice and you know I I knew what he was doing so yes I I I think that some sentence would have been fair you know on some level\nBut you have to also understand the prosecutor asked for eighty nine years for me oh my goodness I I was given the mandatory minimum the judgment as low as he could go is hands were tied that was the lowest yeah that was the lowest go he couldn't go no lower because of mandatory minimum laws um\nI just feel you know hey maybe I'd never I never even had a speeding ticket you know so like two years three years maybe and maybe you know probation for ten years I have no problem you know checking in doing what I have to do and you know following the letter of the line\nSo not to interrupt but I think like the whole the whole thing with the sentence with her getting Fifteen Years is that it is such an arbitrary number you know what I mean I think that as sensing goes we should\nYou know a lot of judges to do what we haven't trusted them to do taken the factors of the case taking the history of the case taken the the situation of the individual and decide what can I hand down that is going to be fair\nYou know there is this moment in the movie that just\nBroke my heart I'm Cindy your dad is ... he can't afford to go out to see you in prison but he wants to make sure you have enough money to use the phone to call your girls and two years at one point collecting scrap metal to do that I Want to play some tape here [noise]\nBut you have a real leader regularly reviewed extra rather got enough here for sending other forty dollars for the ... that's what I Try to wherever they just don't have enough money for those are never missed a rich for\nMoney I can afford to go up there all the way right no fear you know ... or ... ... troops every every week or [noise]\nBut I don't miss a lot but I don't know what else [noise] you know\nHearing that scene back and watching it in the theater I thought of my own dad and if if he were ever that tender and speaking about his love for me\nI don't think you would want a camera did you have any moment where you said Cindy don't put the family out there like that\nI never have I guess I I never thought that no nobody should see this what if anything I'm proud of my father and the man that he is and how loving his towards science absolutely and\nWho wouldn't want to share that what a good man he is what a good dad he is of course I wouldn't want to share his love for me to the world\nIt was beautiful you're listening to it's been a minute from NPR I'm Sam Sanders we're talking about a new HBO documentary called the sentence it's about a woman who was sentenced to Fifteen Years in prison because of mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws\nThis film was actually inspire politicians from both sides of the aisle to try to change those mandatory minimums\nThis seems like an issue that might transcend either party you have people in Congress Republicans and Democrats who will agree\nThat there are too many Americans in prison and that some of these sentences particularly for non violent offenders are too long there is agreement there you've got folks running the gamut from Rand Paul to combine the Harris right why has there been no movement on this issue knowing that there's\nAnd every one thinking misses the thing that needs to change so let me tell you this so two days after we permitted at Sundance\nI was contacted by a senator a Republican senator from Utah Senator Mike Lee he said thank you for making the so one of the dollars that seemed some dance and he said I Believe in this I Believe in this issue and I believe in sentence reform so with Senator Mike Lee\nSenator Cory Booker a Democrat from New Jersey together in a bipartisan effort brought the film to Capitol Hill\nTo show to staffers to show the legislature to show to the house to say this is how we need to approach this it can no longer be me versus you it's an odd thing so it's an a political film that makes it more political\nCindy\nOne of the most striking features of the film was watching your children grow up onscreen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Your Money", "city": "Madison", "day": "20"}
