P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nI'm Ira Flatow and you're listening to science friday we're talking with Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twenty team Nobel Prize in chemistry um [noise] hey you know a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the differences\nWell I Love to build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you [noise]\n[laughter] yes it's really amazing it's changed so much in the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou're saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write new DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edit it but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology\nMolecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules in codes to ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nSo what you mean then and what what do people mean and then when you say uh the directed evolution of something what is that process me\nIt's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs race horses lab rats corn\nFor thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube I can go direct to the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct mutations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product out of that what's the next step [noise]\nYou put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own and a day and they then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes\nThan I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\n[laughter] I Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty and dogs are so many interesting behaviors\nThat can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details that are as we sequence more things and under and measure their properties will be using in Portland in powerful tools like machine learning to peace out in to try to pull out what is the genetic basis\nWhile you weren't you intend to pay that my my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see any I give you while he's got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have\nA powerful enough tools to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use a and machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that want to be a great ambition just to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards be you know we broadcast the eggs every year the day after Thanksgiving and we know mark Abrams pretty good so I think we can put in yeah you know might be able to put in a good word for you know\nWell I was actually hoping to win the Ig Nobel prize before but that would be fun to great that would be marvel at I\nThink it might be a little easier for you now too I think a doctor for taking time to be with us today\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious dues indivisible political races Ken we have better conversations about the issues they get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those the vines or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and um [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are phoning in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey along a neighbor [noise]\nHi there Hi there go ahead I fell off\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic with that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide you systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so\nI'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing I Am and that's\nUm and identifying myself in such a way it really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nHe's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we others see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spend two don't trying to defend our end points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is\nAnd one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences so in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly\nUsing emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience [laughter]\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions don't require man he requires empathy empathy is carrying enough to respect another view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way politics math and these things have poor as boundaries I mean we've been stuck to the north of us official boundaries between subjects up your classic\nSupport for WPRI comes from you W credit union providing investment options like IRAs along with financial consultants who are dedicated to listening to members needs more at you WC you dot org your best interests always comes first\nThat's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not we'll talk about some from the current events or let's turn out to the artist topic and current events and then as voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault against a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process as at plagues tell me what you mean by that\nThere's a whole other on a whole lot of different parts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence and the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocent until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the mind I'm the woman both innocence at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and Salafi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes\nBy shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time it it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at not wild and go what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen and does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we kept that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't for you to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWith prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to\nThe next problem is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments that the momentum divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between I'm so there is a an argument's around saying\nSomething like um you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but said on his blog that that we are ... just spin the both will crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are\nAs bad as rape and there are other things that are bad\nBut perhaps not as bad as rape which comes takes us to\nThe issue of false equivalence is and stroll puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence\nAnd then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying or your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\n'em to finally um that's the question of knowledge and ... ton hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a little while you have to decide what you'll default position is and then to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very sure that they deserve to be punished whereas\nIn the case of a Supreme Court appointment than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important and\nSo we should be very sure that they deserve that very good and important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\nThe we should nuke we should not punish somebody if there is some doubts about whether they should be punished which means if there is something something good to offset the are showing us about the fact that they all about\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the

[noise]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large man how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the theory scratching their heads a little\nBit yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect anyone I Know the theory but pat detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far is using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing\nIf you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well\nIn addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet and so that makes the planet ... around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so\nSometimes I planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also\nA something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey says that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about it you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they yeah well\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes Stordahl claiming is ah one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job or trying to rule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA good question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planet in the system and that's that's pulling on this planet and making and walk around\nA those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible is not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm\nIt was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this natural very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about\nMeasure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and are obvious\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nThe poison squad one camera single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn that the the clock back\nTo that time period ... or you have an entire chapter on catcher\n[laughter] well it was so and they do that ... while you're devoted when I read it I Know why or why the vote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is it gets up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea during the ... century idea of catch up which is you know of a sick tomato base conned about but\nIn the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of thin nasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways in it people would put pumpkin runs people would put tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called our guys and then because the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preservatives is in a like sodium ...\nWhich that she's still with us today and so this ... pick this kind of battle ground of food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair and in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz food man you\nHim self to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato an acid that kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we may or not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food they're afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nI Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nPlus you know there was a major combat over the preservatives and get to her and that was pretty fascinated\nUs let's talk about a ... Harvey Washington where early in the morning the focus of your book in the partisan squad um he actually started where people volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out food safety ever tell us about that the what is one of the ... you had some it was amazing\nIt's just crazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really sense for about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know at\nCompletely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things into human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees a mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time\nHad to be adding capsules of the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very high\nAnd so during the poison ... squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at ... which is a cleaning product he looked at Salo silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you are food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety [noise]\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller ... he and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also in like ten or a preacher on the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war and he had interviewed his kids\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin stout offering online undergraduate and graduate degrees and professional education that certificate options were adult learners you W stout dot edu slashed WPRI\nStarts feeling at a party spilling the layers of it apart and the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government\n[noise] hang on travel golf [laughter] they can take a drink of water that aren't there you go um [noise]\nHe has this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare and this is kind of how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person\nWho drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation at our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually more and more of their laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that get angry I Am\nSo after you know he's like battling always stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed and one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug act of Nineteen oh six past somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was ... and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection low ever passed by the federal government\nAnd so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nBut and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died\nBefore it was created or you know you were said though that you disagree with some of his of his tactics [noise]\nKnow he was as I say kind of a holy roller yeah and he became very rigid I think some of that was that he was under attack constant attack both in government and out of it for Thirty years and he kind of odd sulfide to some extent in a perpetual defensive position\nBut also he he just\nHe couldn't bend on even the little details so he would like spend his political capital this is my personal opinion\n[laughter] as I second guess them a hundred years later [laughter] you would like obsessed about you've made of vinegar and it's a fake vinegar and you should not be allowed to even put",
