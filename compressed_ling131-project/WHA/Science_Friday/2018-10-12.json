P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nThere is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference well it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems how does all of this affect voting behavior\nAnd our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call a number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nLife to be here and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I ... I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do their\n[noise] I'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do for first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nAttacks on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers eat whole books was attacked but I think\nUm we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case there was something different\nKnow know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still are not have confirmed whether or not they're they're certainly wasn't an attempt to hack them\nI'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you kind of what argues they're often or a tablets or or ... or or computers that are used to check people in 'em and uh uh as I said a last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breached but at least in\nThere was some dinner and it sounded like them uh that was actually\nBreached Charles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine compromise [noise]\nWell um [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial question ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I and malaria really helped 'em um and making the distinctions among the Russians\nUm what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think\nUm if we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems\nUm in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states um they got attacked those are voter registration systems\nUm and then there's the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several\nStates um or potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and\nIf we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to\nThe DEF CON um activities and so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerability that are well known\nThat um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all\nI'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly um that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access\nThat in order to have a actually and effective attack on them um you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and would be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing because it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nBut I I don't have any right\nUm well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking hum hum are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election\nBeing there in that position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing\nThat um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think they're\nBut wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines were monkey with and there were mistakes in the program and so um yeah I I tend I tend to fall on the side I think that the machines white now twenty eight key well\n\n\n\n\n\nGood afternoon you are listening to the ideas network we're at the present moment experiencing some impairment with the science friday program today we will return to science friday as soon as possible thank you for your patience\n\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio we are currently experiencing difficulty in presenting our normally scheduled program we are working to return as soon as possible and we appreciate your patience\nOnce again we are experiencing program

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement to ask\nCountries to limit the temperature increase to just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C. this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report\nAnd tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much great to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners being ah with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh your worries are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us ... fry 'em so Dr living the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even a one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that um how's it going to actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing kill a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and a half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nIn ... for example [noise]\nExcept for example on what they found is they look to class and number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we\nGrave warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects I'm almost forty percent worse uh under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reef with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nYou know it doesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the river to orange or a degree\nSo what the report finds is that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible um there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happen on right now\nA emissions are roughly fifty to get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent they're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount\nAnd go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide\nPer year by twenty thirty\nAnd then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century so this is a tremendous transformation and department edition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices um a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least who commissioned to what they do they use [noise]\nShow or a show on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case\nSupport for WPRI comes from people's food co ops offering co-op basics with purple signs in store grocery staples pantry items vegetables and more committed to getting any budget more at P. F. C. dot co-op\nOn about a week ago and that all of the government's signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policymakers show in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] [noise] ... where a lot of people want to talk about it I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice [noise]\nYes hello so\nSo I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up confusing\nBut when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts us in our culture is the high temperature is a record high so for example in the mid West is corn\nGets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night and kills the pollen and greatly reduced to jail or in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperature and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American force grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the ... atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more of the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...\nOther things like that that will instill Vegas grow more plants\nAnd we can have them for food feed and feel I oh you are you a farmer [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy super which makes food for food feeding fuel all of the same maker and it uses little water and I just you know everybody thinks we're going to have some\nYou know puts the will to an atmosphere where all the plants will take it up if we switched to the renewable using plants\nAren't let me get a comment thing thanks for your call what about can we saw some of the CEO to reverse some of this\nThanks um ... some really good points here I think first on as um as you mentioned the one point five degree goal is for global average temperature increase temperatures increase at any one location especially on any one particular moment in time\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I said spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls I'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not\n... and there you can you recognize their own\nUm I didn't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver so um but when there's you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food\nItem you know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that's the sad that we hear is that right is that this usually this is those are squirrel monkeys and we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because we're monkeys sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of score monkeys instead of\nBird how hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference and to study this sounds\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and he knows everything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing it for a little longer he started with\nWith uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes sometimes he does he like he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about human language for evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nSo um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis and um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans\nStarted living in social groups that we're increasingly large\nAnd so manual grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes andme attacks\nBecame less less feasible really and so the ideas that humans would have invented an\nAlternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact in social bonds with their their friends\nUm and that would leave the hands also free for other tasks um and the idea that that eventually would have evolved into human language now square monkeys for living in groups so groups so large they're actually\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

the wild wild oceans they must swim back to the coast to one very particular river mouth\nAnd then reach ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just a compass is just telling you wearing north is also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north isn't more north east east and south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what if they had long food suspected that Pacific salmon can detect the magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about there in Lansing dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked blinds you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said about but salmon living impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles to their journeys tech\nThat is pretty impressive and their journeys can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\nAnd and they usually hedging these are these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back\nThat's correct and they don't just have to\nRight stream to go how does he do this ... don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS from some stories in\nThe ... the same and have a diverse\nArray of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they'd generally would use their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something\nMore broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\nNow I Know the year researchers looking at a different group of Sam be lapped exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\n\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\nAnd ... and yet you round but they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed at the ...\nThat's correct and and\nHow were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for a map\nAnd so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as Meg field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict or favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they formed a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nSo\nThey're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but it's one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species have tiny chains of magnets height and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells\nAnd the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nThough these structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nNow why why is it important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nWell it's a rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it lent examine also ...\nThat does ethnic maps of diverse and not know amounts of these days\nBut we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic environments one can they even detect the magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm so how did you go about testing research so\nThe eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were retired and subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coils and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire and when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nIs a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that it allows us to alter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nMhm so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school though if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf that were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of NATO tight right that right somehow connect with an herself\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fishing event by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific guy and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scaled ...\nSo what so speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look I made magnetic resolution of this map\nSo having a series of points moving them closer and closer together and to see how fine or core scale their responses actually are mhm\nSo uh could you save endangered salmon man by knowing some more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve 'em knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and probably a tool and Sam and conservation but certainly not the only thing\nThat we can go right to serve them yeah well good luck to you and your future experiments All right", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "12"}
