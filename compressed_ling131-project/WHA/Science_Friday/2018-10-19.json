P. R. dot org and\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of the sections happening all over the world listen to this to worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is up to what are the effects on mothers and babies\nAnd what interventions can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally\nAlso what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number a four four seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you uh tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world [noise] well\nIt does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overuse C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with on women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first is area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough access probably are under using it about Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... and it's All right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having um has this area and we're way over\nLast talking about over by us there's it's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but that you write women who are wealthier who had insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm is part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise]\nAnd again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater\nMarion and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... is his area and is not a low risk a surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the score and still birth and preterm birth later with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nWhy the not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and in countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to to stay at at the outside there are women\nWho and babies at that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why C sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ... thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the do the do you have to approach this do you ever ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions or a patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\n[noise] yeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation for us the very end um at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nOn it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress string labor in terms of the cervical dial a nation I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on the brain delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to them\nAll I Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit where a woman is giving birth is it\nUm there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a badge and birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the\nCommitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her and her physiology two two best achieving ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday [noise]\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nThough I actually had an emergency he's thirty why do we um and I think for that\nFor that [noise] um but when I got pregnant for a second time I really wasn't given the option of that over after that um I kind of had to do all of that um\nIt said I said on my ... I I look at me but I I I look at what were the very end might agree you took pregnancy and um it really was it was\nLike my ... or\n... you want to have the time I was like oh sure I like that but I wasn't that get their risk and then it will make a truly at it\nUm and so I think that I was able to\nActually win that Senate seat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and I\nReally like that and I was able to see that but I feel like there was a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had to er to okay in a lot of information very emotional and it was really hard to find the facts\nOr ... when I get when we get a really great great call let me get a ... a reaction Tony ... you know I'm\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of seeing sections and what that means for women's health\nBut I guess her doctor highly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony goal and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach here compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says ... and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have\nA collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that mid with free was as so seeded with improved outcomes increasing including decreasing C sections until one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how how friendly the state was in a regulation um in reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of births are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and in and out comes in the country and only one percent of bursts are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type steady\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nOh Tony going you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary ... um first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are and labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring\nQuite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make\nSurgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use fetal heartbeat monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definitions for progress in labor a old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and ah and I'm enthusiasm for the back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and I would do if you were always from so phone down here in Boston and so there's this old me now to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever tweeter vets relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies may go and and versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report holiday\nWill ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level the playing field in in any in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIn in time or perceived to be in time\nAnd is he your your ... issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the\nUs a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery then is his area and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here in the U. S. Adrian person is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length\nOf today you have to go to Sharon in Somerville new era\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor to complicates\nI really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get the perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and\nUm I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nAs questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know pushed the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions and I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nHere I've got about a minute a tone of your own\nWhich I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... and are fully fully discuss\nThem and told me what about this the charge of sexism\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how baby is born I'm the person who gives birth to the baby becomes apparent uh after that happens\nOn its know lesser known more regardless of what the motive delivery ... delivery I'm certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a bachelor's degree\n... enemy professor midwifery at Yale School of nursing Tony ... vice chair of quality and the department of his obstetrics and gynecology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Becky both protecting starting today You're welcome\nTo science documentaries podcast undiscovered is back with the second season and this week the undiscovered team investigates a cross oceanic turtles feud that tried a turtle to over ... she wanted to they're\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the typical ... plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nThink about fees and aunts and spiders tiny as they are in their own vital parts of our ecosystem weather as food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hive mind ride\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful\nAnd can individual behavior still heal the hand of faith for the whole group or the hives envied legion my next guest\nLooked at these questions Alice Waters is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumble bee and Noah picked a woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of bees and and even spider [noise]\n\n... what did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nMy did my PHD in a honeybee labs\nAnd but I went roads and work done by movies instead I started to make a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit and we can use to answer all kinds of really cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to honey bees bumblebees have a very different like psycho right out of the colonies gets started\nA first honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social on there's never a point in their live in a life as a hobby queen\nWhere she's living on her around the bumblebees are different and they have an annually social life cycle where queens in late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and he's clean\nAnd they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens half to crawl out of there over wintering thoughts\nAnd start their own death so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nAnywhere brought another show us what they look\nLike I did yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees to actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these big groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way the ... the way that they live\nAbout ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and ... my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... home\nYou're brought some adults with who are ... Jarvis harvest France from I'm here in California oh it's like for a partially on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what you are a little bit longer there but yeah and of course she than the ones you see on the sidewalk and what why are you interested in the\nCity they him the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between us sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they called her friends to foods so another thing I brought here as a cast ... to flip it over I was on its\nHead oh so it was like that that's a cast of a an ad Smith yes you is there like pouring plaster Paris it's exactly faster players from Home Depot how far does that goes on is this the whole life and now that's just the top part\nAbout six eight inches long works from just describing for audience would have to go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is a type of metal said when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and it won't break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how deep they can go\nThrough so much focus on queen bumblebees wonder about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said that the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this or whether it was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or for what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumble beach do we how do you make a queen well\nWhat we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\n... and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your own and four star runner were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the knees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets styles\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack that up for your work with food and you're allergic\nSo I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um that's really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the venom and there'd be interact and\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question uh no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how were they are large different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of species and so there's different types of ... and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground raise bees will and\nPut their highest inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example those honeybees in some species offense will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will\nGo and look for a new nest site in ... the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends will also there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places so there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have a um colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so the leaf cutter\n... million individuals\nJust been talking for Halloween I Know that you also studies social spider border social spider\n... about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are living groups and the reason we think they leave in living things groups is so that they can capture pray that is larger than them and so they offered lead build these\nKind of retreat structure is where they live and they raise their offspring together so that you see behind me as a team or a bunch of fame spider moms there actually each one is probably the size of a centimeter centimeter half so half an inch or so\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nOr science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did\nYou sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience to search for about sleep in the United states among other countries are in great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... what is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits were schedules\nCould there be jeans at work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how will we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back there came a Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n[noise]\nRight you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is just\nFor um the majority of long term studies that are looked found that if you get significantly less or significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night than that\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah because I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is not going to ... in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what\nWe do know is that if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can set a short term so many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just may be out for the kids\nNot get enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases and it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke\nAnd diabetes and I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nInterestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what one of the genes\n... that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nI'm there a time of day you prefer to sleep the time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day where most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nThey're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressing the brand they're expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on in my most recent study it'd be on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have had a lasso ... one is what's known as the clock seeing your clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it\nIt has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know what a clock yours are\n[laughter] so I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones at the time I have is an output mechanism that allows\nYou to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulate sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite\nIn the skeletal muscle can speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain\nHow to sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss\nAnd when do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it's kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that are the hit on if it goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more you get too much sleep will go and the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from those so when you say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily\nRhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and what isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours a shouldn't overhear yes I have a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of the cells so napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way\nThey win by yourself than an hour and I do think that one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon no one can complain you can write it off I mean I Know what I'm doing this research [laughter] what you're saying napping is important is the\nMapping is very important if you're not getting daily stuff is asleep and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment and may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but anything from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much so that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh\nI have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't\nBlame them either exactly right that's why I don't try I understand but that's just like let me go to the questions on his side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers can be later in the day because yes [laughter]\n\nAnd and as a parent and I definitely want that to happen because getting my kids up in the morning\nA challenge how does your study a fact", "year":
