world [noise] so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that\nI Know that I Am African I Am indigenous\nI Am also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ...\nAnd to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to be in the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves\nWhen you look at an issue like

as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes\nPeople say like oh wow you're\nThe way you articulate your platform is still interest action on\nAnd to me it's not even that we're trying it's\nAnd so what would it needs to be American Movie grabbing like how we grew up on these values was\nMy dad would go visit family in Puerto Rico every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah\nYou mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... William yeah those are like a two places where we went on family she cried\n[laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg and for thirty going out of the ... that's\nHow do you manage that as being a young enough\nYou know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy risk you know rice um and at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been a process but I had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face\nOn the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty eight teams and she looked at it and we were laughing at it because it doesn't feel like this isn't my ... this is an island but we're laughing at it\nAnd she says that's what you are you're an idea now and I felt like\nTo be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that maybe they just are an interesting question are you managing your ego 'cause I mean the truth is is that\nYou're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\n[noise] it is and if any thing\nThere are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary [noise]\nIn my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of experience is terrifying I feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying some of the most vulnerable people in society\nThe issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue\nThey're just not their top versus bottom and so for me I still struggle with even conceiving\nThe idea of getting a call back like sometimes I talked to our team and I'm like do you think so and so would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I still worry about people showing up to my then\nWas an article I think it was in the New York or were they made a point of rain out that when you talk kitchens you come down to their level mhm\nIn terms of the way you you say you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be named yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect a political tactic\nWorld no no I\nFeel like I learned it from my parents\nAnd when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nParents were never political you know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never organized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think of my parents have natural organizers they were so good at building community\nWent to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester\nKind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the houses\nThe kinds of people that I went to school in\nMy dad really struggled to start his own small business [noise]\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards the towards the actually the end of his life and so my mom would invite\nThe cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over\nGot fifty ... ... talk because those are the people that are family could relate to [noise]\nThey were always about leaning in to people and the politics comes second\nPractice as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs my number one job is to care about people and to lean into them\nShow them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nThen we talk about the politics\nWhat is your puppy same to you when you're hearing your dad no\nI think [noise]\nKnow it's like I'm so ocean although\nI'm Sorry not what's already to threaten oh my gosh it's okay what is the prime tell me what your um just because it's like [noise]\nNo one's asked me that question [noise]\nSo [noise]\nIt's weird because like I guess I'm not\nProcessing this as you're asking me but it's like um\nIt's like having someone walking with the whole time and it's somewhat and then like you're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this guy I think\nSo it's it's a little emotional but um\n\nThe last thing\nMy dad ever told me before he passed away [noise]\nWas make me proud\nAnd for a really really really long time\nI felt like I felt like I had failed my parents because of the situation we're in my dad had passed away my mom was back to cleaning houses I was tending bar and waiting tables and I felt like\nTo be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that\nIt's okay to be flawed\nYou know because we don't really see characters like that very much [noise]\nI think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect [noise]\nSociety and within our families and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know that\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are [noise]\nThank you for putting it into words Erica Sanchez we really really appreciate your work being used so much I

are navigating higher education and we looked at how one university Oregon State is trying to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs many of which are filled by young Latinos and that the nuts and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path\nTo the middle class [noise] me stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York\nA nonprofit that among other things conducts demographic research to help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City their data helped to bring you these stories and today\nI'm sitting down with lives are Christian he's the organizations director of use policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\nSo I think lives are when I first met you you were like proudly the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter] absolutely\nI think we live in times where more people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about um real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it [noise] you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in the heights\nLike Washington Heights affect the way it gives a a wake up and I got the ...\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows\nThe mental Miranda I mean I thought it\nWas a terrific show and displayed in all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nDominican Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard sauce until I went to college\nSo I started thinking about while I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself\nI wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans and we've seen the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the new policy field that I work and\nSo what did you find what surprised\n... working in New York City schools and it and the policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers\nReally have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities\nBoth ways to make them great and the way that we can support them to be even better\nI I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised in a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Latino non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group as compared to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what\nWe find is that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school to the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture\nAnd among women in particular which is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison the Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans in New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and the cops going culture may not be as strong [noise]\nMeeting so there's a whole conversation around desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing but what it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of making it into smaller\nBite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and like the United states increasingly I think\nIn our analysis and now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strengths in different communities and we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently", "show_name": "Latino USA", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "31"}
