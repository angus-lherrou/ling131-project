I started reading their data and the first thing that my father said you know dear Shani indeed slated I'm telling you that your brother or they handle had passed away and I got I just stopped there and I started crying and I probably went crazy I don't know\nMy mom then called or other brothers to ask what happened\nBut nobody wanted to say anything but later on my brother he said to me when we went in a cemetery or some sunnier so I'm there and run came and took to me and he said you know we know your family so just even liked that\nHis family was told not to ask questions about it at all but how could they not\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nMy quest to find out what really happened to my uncle started in twenty eleven when I visited Guatemala for the first time since I was a kid to my surprise my family and Guatemala seemed as clueless as I was about how a hundred died [noise] no one had more than a piece or two of the puzzle and want to put those pieces together they still didn't fit [noise]\nCentral America's longest and most brutal civil war has come to a man for the past thirty six years left us rebels bottled Guatemala's army\nPiece was finally negotiated between the government and the various guerrilla groups so he left the armed forces and it's part of the peace accords all guerillas had to present themselves before the local United Nations mission to formally accept a deal but when ... his name was called he stood up and was shocked by what the woman reading his name said to him\nThe whole ... because that was the show yo yo man what I found it I mean they don't ...\nThe woman told Alex said he couldn't possibly be the man she called he said yeah that's me all the humdrum and those are the woman told them but you died in Nineteen Seventy eight Alex asked a woman to read the maternal last name of the man on her list\nWhat is it a little bailed out but it won't vale does enable Gaddafi mortar\nShe said motor suddenly they hit it but that's when Alex realized she was talking about his father Alex Heard the un read off the name of two more family members that day but he wasn't sure whether to believe that so many relatives were secretly gorilla\nAnd this is the ... it will just in the rain yeah you're on the in the least I thought I could I ever yet and yet I'm\nAlex as a guerrilla fighters inflated their membership rolls of innocent civilians so that they would sing bigger than they really were even if those civilians had no affiliation with the insurgent groups in real life so it was difficult to know whether my uncle a hundred or anyone else in the family was actually involved in the war [noise]\n\nLike me my cousin's curiosity grew with he got older and a few years later he started his own investigation into what really happened to his dad his quest to come to a method line the town with a family recovered his father's body\nHe spoke to retired gorillas in the area and local law enforcement and the story he pieced together it was very different than the one ... told me this story makes more sense if you consider how dangerous Guatemala was in those days and why my family might have wanted to hide the real reasons for my uncle's death\nWhere to look at you already way let me five ... ... ... if you get your own inclusive and get a year and we're not the ...\nFrom what Alex discovered his dad died on a farm will try to collect the famous war tax the war tax was with the gorillas charts farms in rural areas to help support themselves but it was mostly imposed on people\nAnd this is where it gets complicated\nSomebody must have alerted the locals that my uncle and his friends were coming because when they arrived members of the military would there waiting for them when lawyers in that I don't we don't get as I got out of\n... look as I say I mean if I could almost I don't I don't buy new it'll mess people ambushing them and grabbed his father as soon as they enter the farm you know they use the alec says this is where his father was killed me about that is feeling my thought on that much that\n... hundred adept with a machete him like they had his neck\nAnd backed his chest until it's heart hung out of his chest I saw his picture than he had some ... [noise]\nSo one version of the story has my uncle dying in a bar fight one that started because of a love triangle and ended with the government accusing my uncle of being a guerilla fighter\nThe other version is that he was a guerilla fighter who was extorting people and ended up mutilated by the military given how different these two stories are I asked my cousin about the origins of the bar story after all the borrowing version wasn't in any newspaper it was with my uncles told us\nAnd Europe as soon as I mean a set to begin with I Know that they look at the U.S will say ... up I thought I Would go back to\nMy cousin said that after his father died people threatened the family and told them all not to talk about what happened Alex things maybe this is when our family decided to tell the love triangle story instead and he says it's okay for them to have their version is keeping his\nScares again because if you don't get your medical me what you [noise]\n... ... ... ... ... ... ...\nI don't know if the me and my uncle Alondra was a hero or a villain\nI'd heard that the fog of war treats the Jewish and like my uncles were the truth campaign down\nBut I didn't expect was that people could come to prefer this blog [noise]\nFrom my mom excavating such awful stories about her brother is something she wants to avoid\nWhich is partly why she's only returned to Guatemala a handful of times in the last forty years\nAnd I noticed that some people said that to me why I Wonder what the what what are your essay I don't want to ...\nDon't want to remember that stuff probably\nIt's strange to hear my mom said that\nBy naming the after my uncle my mom ensure that neither of us would ever forget his murder\nNames like memories can be powerful\nThings to reporter Jesse and they had to control\nAnd now we're going to turn to an interview that I recently did with one of the most know where the names in hip hop history in the early Nineteen nineties a young emcee from the south Bronx exploded onto the hot seat\nWas oh San Sonia ... ha\nThat Joe is a rapper of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent and if you don't already recognizes debut single slow Joan\nThen I'm pretty positive you recognize nice\nTo leave\nYear he'll be releasing a new album ... family\nWill cool and drank let along with over two decades in music Joe has also begun to create a steady career in acting most recently in the twenty seven the Netflix series she's got to have\nIn the new comedy night school starring Kevin Hart and\nTiffany Haddish hasn't gotten into the wife of the class is not the worst you'll see the movie is a story\nAbout a group of misfits attending night school in the hopes of getting their ... and indeed Joe plays the character of Bobby who's an inmate who joined tonight class through Skype\nFat Joe and I talked about his experience of growing up in the south Bronx his beginnings in hip hop and about his new role in the film school\nThe first time that I heard about you [noise]\nWhen when I was in the Bronx [noise] with a group that guy known as the ...\nOh yeah that's my crew love those guys we've been together for over twenty something years and I'm so tat tat screw was really T.

that'll work\nWelcome back to Latino USA ... wholesome\nWhen we talk about pollution we often think about our physical health things like our lungs are skiing but what about our brains\nJust this last year a nationwide study was released the first of its kind\nThat looked at the newer logical effects of pollution on children in schools across the country the researchers tested for exposure at around eighty five thousand US public schools and they found that the schools with large black and brown populations\nWere disproportionately affected by pollution\nI sat down with Sarah Elizabeth ... who co wrote the study to talk about her findings grew nephews based in Salt Lake City Utah but I decided to start first by recording my own observations of pollution outside of our offices in Harlem and I asked Sarah for her impressions\nAll right so it's one to two in the afternoon [noise] we're right here on the hundred and twenty of history you can hear the announcement\nOf the bus right behind us so one bus well let me see I see\nOne small little I'm kind of hospitals bus\nA school bus right behind that\nA regular city bus behind that a van a truck another double size was and this is just\nOne second on a hundred and twenty fifth street [noise]\nYeah I mean it sounds like you're located right there in the center of\nA lot of traffic and you know city life\nMeans Salt Lake city we also it's a pretty big city here we have you know a fair amount of traffic pollution and buses and everything but what I was actually thinking about when you were talking about what's outside or just all of the health risks associated with those different exposures that you're hearing\nAnd not only the respiratory risks for our breathing but also you know cardiovascular effects and what my research has been focusing on which is you know neurological effects and how air pollution actually can harm our brain so that gets released\nBecause I I'm like okay first of all I feel like a terrible mother because I did raise my kids in New York City in Harlem but also it just makes me wonder about what this is done to my own brain so what do you mean exactly 'cause that sounds quite shocking and quite scary\nSo working theory now coming from neurologist is that when you breathe in the pollution for example through your nose and it damages the nasal along at the steel EMs and allows the pollution to enter your body\nThen generates an immune response which causes tissue swelling and immune cells release of toxic species and then it can lead to diffuse loss and damage of neural tissues\nOkay and for those of us like okay I was raised with a scientist so I got a little bit of that but then there was a lot of people were like okay I feel like I lost some brain cells just getting that interpretation\nWould it really means is that if you're breathing in air that's contaminated it can find its way to your brain and and essentially you're saying it slows us down\nWell yeah it causes inflammation which damages our brain and changes the way that it functions there is a medical doctor she's at the University of Montana Dr ... guys who joined us and she actually does work in Mexico city\n\nAnd she does autopsies on otherwise healthy youth that are basically you know killed in traffic accidents or other accidental deaths and she looked at their brains and she's compared their brains to the brains of you who have died of similar causes and less polluted Mexican cities like better crews\nAnd she basically finds that they have brain structures that resemble people who have early stage all glamorous disease so she can actually visually see in the brains of these young people\nThese changes which\nShe believes are tied to the air pollution\nThat the children must be you know breathing in as they live their lives and heavily polluted city like Mexico City\nSo in the report the term environmental justice is talked about a lot mhm it and it's been around for a while but just to make sure 'cause there are different definitions what exactly in your view is your definition of environmental justice\nWell the paper that we published and environmental research takes a perspective on distribution all environmental injustice with which has to do with how\nYou know health harming pollution is distributed in space and then how certain social groups are disproportionately exposed to that pollution in their neighborhoods or in our paper in their schools\nSo CERN just to kind of end on this concept of environmental justice what might justice look like for for these communities that are challenged\nSo I think it's really tricky because we can just shift the pollution around [noise]\n\nThere's evidence that as the ... environmental justice movement was achieving some success and Nineteen seventies in the Nineteen eighties\nWhere you know our backyards we're getting at least somewhat cleaner in certain parts of the United states that basically what was happening was these burdens like waste incineration was shifting from the United states to other countries [noise]\nIt's not in my backyard versus not on planet earth right and I think moving towards that nope that not on planet earth whereby we make very conscious decision to protect our children you know remedy environmental injustices that have been perpetrated against people of color in this country for a very long time has to happen\nIn terms of reducing the pollution everywhere and for everyone and not just you know shifting it on to some other less powerful person who then has to deal with it\nSarah thank you so much for all of your research we really appreciate it and they think ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Latino USA", "city": "Madison", "day":
