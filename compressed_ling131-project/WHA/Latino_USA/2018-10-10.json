it's critical I'm playing ... style blur simulator to move in a non otherwise known as forklift truck simulator two thousand and non posted right into the\n... this is a forklift simulator game\nI guess the world is overrun with boxes and pipes and it's up to me to stop the infestation\nLike a video I was like people playing you post on Youtube videos of themselves playing games and they are the people I Love to watch yeah I don't understand why but yes yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get you know but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nAnd like driving a forklift around trying to pick stuff up and like put it on their places yeah but when I think\nThe comments some people are like giving tip so like I drive a forklift and they don't go super fast but it feels like they do when you're in close quarters and warehouses maybe thirty five to forty miles per hour someone else's I keep your forks low to the ground when traveling like under six inches high prevents loads from tumbling off the forks I'm a forklift driver and\nAll these people they commenting like actually drive forklifts our lives and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts and that's because one of the fastest\nGrowing industries in our country today in the industry of moving and storing stuff especially stuff that we order on line\n[noise]\n\nWe're going to start our show by diving into one of the fastest growing parts of the American economy it's warehouses [noise]\nHardly pain between space that all of this stuff from cat food to fuzzy socks flows through on the way to us and\nThe industry is exploding\nThen President Obama visited an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee and he gave a speech about the future of jobs in America with a particular focus on getting a better bargain for the middle class\nWe've invited all with us from the worst recession since the first Gulf millions of Americans are jobs homes and their savings and what does it was a lawyer in the long term Malaysia has been happening when it comes to middle class you're\nObama talked about bringing back manufacturing jobs but he was also there in Chattanooga to highlight job growth in other sectors\nAmazon had just enough that it was hiring thousands of workers for its warehouses nationwide\nNow over the next two years experts are saying that the warehousing industry needs to hire over four hundred thousand workers just to keep up with the growth and e commerce so the jobs of tomorrow are actually warehouse work\nAnd many of those jobs will be held by Latinos and let the nuts\nCurrently in about forty percent of Eighteen to thirty four year old working in the where housing business are Latinos but are these jobs that are taking over any really good jobs\nI mean are they really a pass to a stable middle class life the way that manufacturing jobs once were\nLatino USA producer Soviet police car is going to explore the world of warehouses and she's going to take us inside a high school that sees is booming industry as an opportunity for students\nAnd from cancer treatment centers of America offering immunotherapy and other personalized treatment options to address patients individual needs more about precision cancer treatment at Cancer Center dot com\nWelcome back to let you know usa ... you know offer and before the break we heard from high school students who were learning to drive forklifts and how to organize inventory in order to prepare them from working in warehouses\nNow our producers of buddies that car is taking us to a real warehouse where these young people might work one day\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway\nAnd it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reached out to them to see if I can come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility gave\nMe a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increased automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears just this wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere that said no photo\nOnce a guard left me and I realized that springtime\nTons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners they\nJust under a million square feet [noise]\nAh we also have way more than a hundred full time\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means in fact there's a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associates\nEntry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and minds on the ground like roads which is good because\nMean we'll see another one and all them Avi A. G. these\nBasically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally a man and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nIt just wishes by us\nEverything\nIn this warehouse is yellow and gray\nThey're bright orange when you think of robots isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room because\nThey're square and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds item\nSay somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line\nOnce they do that that's when the item gets\n... notice on the screen\nProvided the item\nItem\nAnd then one idiot how many they need\nThe back massager a second worker calls the orange robots over retrieved massager from the shelf and then puts it on the yellow tray kind of like those airport security trade which go on a conveyor belt accepted the processes\nThat we're going to say\nIs what it sounds like basically the massager comes in on the yellow tray and a worker ... into a box no robots here\nThis is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy ...\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it\nNormally do for should still be so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week\nThe very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping labor all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nAssuming label is created and gently place to err on top of the bomb\nThat sound you hear a puff of air placing it on to that debate\nHard I have to admit is literally my favorite [noise]\nThere's and so the robots Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mothers' room and there are vending machines that I see two they're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly wage to Fifteen dollars\nBut over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says these figures are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom breaks because they feared not making work quotas and that workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAmazon responded that they didn't recognize these allegations that's accurate they also said they coach people who are making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm an Amazon I asked\nWe don't have power over my individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great place with great team members and great\nCourse turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses and the United states\nAnd its on primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voiced concerns\n[noise] [noise]\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nThe warehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall of photos of workers protesting on the other side\nIs one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse workers they trained people on things like wage theft and how to fall for workers' comp for injuries\nAt the warehouse center of the day I visit is Duane Wilson he's twenty five and he drove forklifts for local warehouses\nAlike working in a way as ... you know your muscles a child going into\nTwain's been working in warehouses for the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helped out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency\nAnd the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want him sometimes they do is rebuild it wouldn't be in one day so\nDwayne sometimes lines up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still gets turned away sometimes you only work one full week a month doing shows me his though\nHe gives me flooded with us and if those are\nOkay so it had senior manager in the work tomorrow he says not tomorrow say can I at least we're friday like can you give me anywhere and he does legislate those and I just see if I let out there in Texas I worked in a while you know\nYeah that is a constant tech threat of that basically yeah\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel queen says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for full time job at the warehouse that he works at basically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper temp agencies provide a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them\nThey take money out of each worker's hourly wage and queens that says temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know\nAnd the lack of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up because they don't want to risk sacrificing the hours they do have ... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer but that's not his plan right now\nBecause I'm just going to school the things that is do\nI Wish I didn't complain about ... so ... does go anymore [noise]\nIt's about allowing elected officials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humanity\n\nI was asking myself that question of whether I Want it to tell my story or not and in that moment I just went with it and I said you know I I was five he was Fifteen\nAnd I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do with that information they never did anything so then I just understood the lesson that\nWe are not believed and these boy understood the lesson that boys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listened to survivors and it was a very painful moment I cried after because they realize oh my God maybe my father will hear it this way for me and my mother who hear this way [noise]\nAnd then [noise] it didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that\nInteraction with flake and I said you might hear something and then use I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and I said to him it was not your fault that it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed\nI didn't tell them they started because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women and I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but who stories I deeply deeply understand\nYou see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to [noise]\nAn developing on immigration how did those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of women kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are\nI Can't separate me being a woman from being led the now from being an immigrant from being a mother and now accepting and embracing\nThese other part of my identity as a survivor I think the history of these countries the history of the struggle for inclusion of morals us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the the act of bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act in some deeply human ways it's the least political act\nYeah I think it was the mother and me honestly that came out there is a quote by a seat activist Valerie ...\nSo the mother and meet asks wedded lettuce leaves darkness is not that darkness of that too\nBut the darkness of the ...\nWedding America is not dead but a country waiting to be more what does the midwife say she says when we are in labor she says breeze\nAnd then Bush because if we don't breeze we'd die if we don't Bush we die if we don't push America today but if we push with our labor and I love\nAnd our vision we will
