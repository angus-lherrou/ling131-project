and in fairness she did famously go head to head with Governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests to hold people who were accused of minor offenses\nSince Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now in door seen her for governor but ... says oh\nWell actually I talk\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progress as want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nSame wired to go to that place but I don't have that power\nThis is a federal issue that the governor\nKnow I wouldn't just make a statement I take action action can be taken in this before\nIs cruel bill and is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called F before and it was signed by governor Abbott last year a Governor Greg you broadcast the moment in a Facebook video\nAs a son in law liberal than sanctuary cities in\nThe law essentially forces local police to work with federal immigration officials and it allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it ensures\nLong for so long as you can and will cooperate with a\nSheriff ideas opposes the law and has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign she also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition but\nThen we ask her about another policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nSaying about the original task\nAdvice was to keep people out who would do harm they've got away from them and it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\nThat another attack on a major city is is not going to happen do honestly just want him to let them come in\nAnd and do an attack on the city's sounds a little republic and what you're saying I Know it doesn't it sounds like we want to protect our country\nAnd so maybe some Republicans might like as strong borders national security rhetoric [noise] maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm some young Democrats by winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days\nWhen we were in Odessa we met a Republican voter out the Mexican restaurant who told us\nTo create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confident and use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas\nAnd said I did this and valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than ... million dollars and their law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns besides Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have a really benefited from this is Kris Kobach\nSo if you think now about you know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the\nLarger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump and the White House and directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration you know I I think that prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing his hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impactful voice than he otherwise what\nI think that we can learn from what he has told us he believes then\nI think that it is a sign that radical elements of our country have sort of taken a much larger role and we can no longer just miss\n\nGood thank you so much for all of your reporting
