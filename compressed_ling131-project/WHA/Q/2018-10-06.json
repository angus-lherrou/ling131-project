would vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh as you explained his decision to reporters he was drowned out by protesters\nI looked at me like it should be so we'll just see that at a photo investigation by the way it was from I think a lot of people that I was concerned about how they said what they say how they did all the\nBut do they have suggested that they want to deport Hassan to Syria\nIf they did proceed with the charges that he would stay and remind wouldn't be so they would uh they they want about\nYeah if if they had pursued the criminal charges strangely it would've been better for 'em because um he we would have had time to try and figure out how to protect him\nWhat would happen to him if he was deported in Syria he what what does he believe would occur\nWhile he would definitely be imprisoned because he is wanted because he does not completed his mandatory military service he has very clearly you know stayed into objections to the civil war that's happening in Syria\nAnd he has been quite critical of the Assad regime which means that he would get may be imprisoned probable that he would be tortured it could be even worse\nYou and others had been trying to stop this deportation and in fact tried to bring him to Canada for all of these months and he has been in the airport so what happened to your efforts\n[noise] well we map occasion Paul to sponsor Hassan to come to Canada we raised over twenty thousand dollars to support that sponsorship application be worked to find a fulltime job so he has a job offer which includes housing in this clip British Columbia\nHe has for close family members here in Canada so we had a sickening meeting government to expedite the costs of the time for that application and to date today have been not able or willing to do that\nIn his status of his file at this point is son has been accepted to Canada is that right\nHints application has been approved to quote what all that means is that when we submitted it it was reviewed by a integration a refugee inches and shipped Canada and approved yet so popular thing at that point it was sent overseas to the high commission of\nUh Canada in Singapore for processing the standard like the type of process and there is twenty three twenty six months\nHe has said that he is willing to sit in the airport for twenty three months of that's what it takes right\nYeah that's what he said we are grateful that they have permitted him to be done for the last seven months since he was only able to survive to the generosity of airline employees who provided him with airline nails it came to the point where Malaysia felt that she could no longer be in the airport\nYou know when we spoke with him back in April he talked about you and your efforts to help him I I just wanted to play a bit of the cooked a where he talks about what you've done for him\nThey made me believe again and then they ought to just ... amazing people know much about what consequences will be quite a Jew or support these people are ... the I'm grateful for the ...\nAs long as I was doing that\nAbout what you and the other Canadians have done for him [noise]\nIt is heartbreaking I you know I have never met the fun but I feel that I Know and I mean we we've gone through a lot together we've spoken on the phone we typed video compensation he has a nickname for me\nI feel like he's my son and his mother has reached out to me a and his sister to you know thank me for what I'm doing but I just I'm very scared right now but I'm also hopeful I Believe in our government I I'm just praying and hoping that they will do that\nOne of the things that um the Malaysian immigration chief said both arresting ... is that he shamed Malaysia because of how much publicity he got that he was making these little videos and if people were I was following him on Twitter about what it's like\nTo live in the airport acts of kindness acts of cruelty that he was subjected to what would it actually take at this point to get him to safety\nOne signature from minister immigration he just needs a what's called the temporary ratcheted permanent that the minister Kenny shoes for someone who is in a car less situation which would permit Hassan to fly immediately to Canada where he could\nWait here while his sponsorship ... Proctor\nAnd without that signature what happens\nHe could die it's it's very it's very\nReal it's a so outside of our daily existence you know I'm a Canadian mom never thought that I Would be in a position\nWhere I Am fighting for some of like I'm just thinking the Canadian government stepped in it would be so easy when you have raised on the twenty thousand dollars\nWe have six thousand signatures on a petition asking the minister of immigration to allow us to come to Canada to full time job here he is for family members living in Canada he has thousands and thousands of volunteers who are ready to welcome him they integrate them into Canadian society and uh\nI just don't understand why we can't help this young now\nThat's Cooper appreciate speaking with you and we will it will keep in touch and we'll see what happens\nOn kitten really appreciate your interest in sports but by the by\nLorrie Cooper is one of a group of Canadians that has been trying to help us on a contract to Canada since April we reach ms Cooper in Venice\n\nSo\n\nYou have like we've seen something like this on a map before there is a place usually an island that is small and\nQuite geographically far from the focal piece of land the center of the map and so they put this little island in a box and shifted closer to the focal point it's completely inaccurate geographically speaking but it's convenient and it makes everything just nice and come back from a design perspective\nYou've also probably spend a little to no time questioning the existence of those boxes on lost her Prague or for ill from shuttle and for some residents Scottish archipelago those boxes have been a point of frustration\nThere a home from that two dimensional confinement by banning government bodies in Scotland from putting Shetland in a box on maps the rule was proposed by Shetland politician ... Scott reached Mr Scott lurk Shetland ... why did you get ... down to the box\nThe many government publications ... on\nA on the other ways in which chaplain has a bean exhibited over the years has usually had the islands placed on a map in a box in the incorrect geographical position\nOn many island does if not all of the island does feel pretty upset by that and we're fed up with the irritation know being in the wrong place\nSo some parliamentary legislation was a available earlier this year and I was able to move um some changes to that legislation so as to make sure there's in future a shepherd dies you say has nothing to box but then it's correct position\nNow is it just because they didn't that people don't like it could hog refers I can ... is there a reason and putting in a box\nI guess the reason there were two hundred miles across a north of all the scholars made lived and therefore I correct pasta\nHas to have a favorite to see the north sea and the way um I don't have a problem with that because we live on islands we depend on ... we have a huge crushing industry that to the to depends on a pristine marine environment\nThat we have the oil industry all around us as well in all the industrial mechanisms that depend on the oil use the sea so it seems to be strange don't have to see is costs of the joke ... ... ah the reality of where we all\nGo first to a post to this day and said that is not had Shetland shouldn't be there would be no new details they actually use these boxes to avoid map sitter\nMostly water and that you do lose so much when you have to I have to expand the map that large you know to have Shetland in there\nWell hey hold my ... leaves hold them I mean they and we live we live I think it's time that we were put in the right place not supplied them does believe that it's not just my items but I think ... throughout the world\nHave the same a view of these uh of the view these things are I think it's a terribly kind of city centric um central as we say in the central belt Massachusetts which is the ... center of the universe and everywhere else to just be lucky to be somewhere and that was in that vicinity\nAre I think we in check and take the views about time that we reverse that instead of looking at it from the center I'm we looked at it from where we live\nThat would make a change in the multi digital world we live in\nOkay so we're talking they can put Shetland in the middle and put like Great Britain in a box\nNot only was it courageous to talk about especially within her own culture and religion to talk about what had happened to her\nFrom its actual point of view because of the taboo issues none of that was relevant to her it was about literally saving hook people I mean it was remarkable to meet her and her strength in her ... year Colyer determination to get things done on behalf of people and to be that voice\nYou know when he had been working on it since the\nI guess with International Women's day in twenty sixteen with my first question to intrude on that day in question period asking him to create a special program to bring you the girls and women to safety in Canada and but it became apparent particularly when ... came to Canada She heard what we were doing she came to Canada\nAnd then it was undeniable no one could look at her and said no we don't want\nTo help the government created a program and\nShe thought she never imagined that this would have happened but she's become really a heroine to her own people into people all over the world\nI wanted to ask you about that voice that person coming into parliament and the effect it had she was what she was in the gallery when there's a ... was debated enjoy\nSitting with my husband holding his [laughter] what do you think it's so hard he said he will never forget when she was\nAnd that's the only time she cried I spend time with her listening\nAnd I remember the I wanted to break down so many times and I thought how could I how could I cried when she doesn't and I just held at all in and as soon as she left the house I just broke down but\nShe was so strong I just couldn't imagine where does she find that strength I kept thinking to myself and then when he was very emotional when you\nWhen parliament voted in favor she broke down and she almost physically\n[noise] my hope for her that she will kill and then she will find some time to heal herself I just I Want her to be happy I knew she age now into he all and find a normal life\nOne of the significant things among all the other things you've just itemize did she did for you know the women and girls for people is\nThe awareness she brought to the world about rape and sexual assault as a crime of war as a weapon of war they were finally prosecutions about this and war crimes tribunals lose our board champion those\nThe recognition that these aren't just things that happened at some individual goes too far these are organized campaigns to destroy communities and cultures through destroying their young women so do you think that that is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHim to go home expected him to put on another a police uniform [noise] I'm In the end of the day we are glad that that did not happen\nWhen you say that there there have been I guess I'm thinking about what happened in to a police officer in Dallas who was sentenced to prison in the summer for murder and are there have been some other cases Oklahoma New York city so\nDo you think is the tide tuning or are these cases that I needed to changing did you make a lot of their their shootings that didn't go this way\nNow know about trying to we got a lot of work that they're okay we can't stop now we've got to make sure that the criminal justice system works we've got to make sure that we have good\nState's attorney said good attorney general's then um [noise]\nPeople that uh will make up the criminal justice system to be fair you know we need a judge's set a diverse you know we don't have made a black or Hispanic judges and the and the cook county and and as a Cook County court\nYou know we have to make sure the criminal the criminal justice system is made up of people who\nCare to do what's right and the ... we have that and we don't have anything um we just have small when along the way but we we kinda got lucky\nWhen do you think it was about the evidence they convince the jury\nWhile you know I think that you know the fact that\nNo other officer to start a weapon and he got out of his car with six seconds and he was already firing round the fact that you live on the stand and acted like the wind was coming towards him play cars parked showed no remorse\nReally act like everything they feel is right you know they look at those witnesses a witness testimony helped as well so I mean I think that he did horrible on span and the state to turn to rip them apart so I Want to give the state's attorney um\nBanks are bad and ah you know I appreciate the great work that they have down to this\nUm because I think that they've done a good job [noise] um and they looked at as the and the jury looked at all of that evidence and looked at a ... Jason Van Dyke testimony which now is that we're hearing that a few jury said that that was why they decided he was guilty\nOr maybe it wasn't good for him to take the stand\nHis testimony was ... was that way to live his guilt that the video itself can you describe the video and the effect it had on his years in in the ... and like likelihood\nVideo I mean if you look at the video and you see\nYou see someone that shot fall to the ground and you see air smoke are more bullets\nI think the video is very gruesome and I think the jury thought so as well is that why would you keep shooting I think if he didn't shoot the Koran as many times it's possible he could have got off the shot and shot him one time", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "06"}
