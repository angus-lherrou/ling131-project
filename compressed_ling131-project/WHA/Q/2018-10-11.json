P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n\n[laughter] from WNYC radio I'm trying to think a part in this is America on the line a news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday night we bring you the latest political news\nAnalysis and your calls so we can get a sense of how we're all doing as we approach November sixth election day we've got a lot to talk about tonight in health care is topic hey thanks to the op ed in USA Today written by President Trump\nThe peace painted a dire picture of what will become of America if the government and dumped say Medicare for all health insurance system which is a number of ... which is a number of Democrats support and a lot of voters do too but here's the thing\nTrump's op ed is full of wet politifact and the Washington Post fact checkers Glenn Kessler say or misstatements in fact capital wrote almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a false could\nSo before we get into the nitty gritty of all this here's a question for you does Medicare for all seemed like a good idea or one of those too good to be true promises that politicians can't really deliver on\nCall us with your thoughts that eight four four seven four or five talk that's eight four four seven four or five eight to five five you can also send us as always a tweet using the hash tag a T L\nK joining me to explain what Medicare for all really is and what it isn't is Jonathan Cohn senior correspondent for half post\nJonathan Cohn thank you for being on America on the line thank you for having me on the show so Johnson the Democrats failed today to pass a bill that would have eliminated what's being called short term healthcare plans but don't cover pre existing conditions what are the short term plans and why did Democrats wants to eliminate them\nSo short term plans have been around for a long time and they're kind of an artifact of the old you know the old Arab before we had the Affordable CARE Act\nUm and they were designed as basically a stopgap you know you're between jobs you ... you know you you you're going to be a couple of months you know between the\nDish employer an employer insurance is going to laugh and you could pay out of pocket for these policies and they weren't very good right I mean they covered some things and maybe it's doctor visits or maybe they didn't didn't some hospitalization up to a point and they wouldn't and and they were sold like the old policies were right you couldn't get them if you had preexisting conditions and ah if you\nGot one of these policies and they discovered that you got sick but you'd actually had it before you bought the policy they wouldn't pay for that either are they charging more for your pre existing condition [noise]\nUm you know a four to ... comes along Obamacare comes along and now everybody can get a you know it's supposed to be able to get comprehensive real insurance right you know the kind that you know would cover any medical service you might need and you know has a limit on you're out of pocket costs and\nUh the Obama administration said okay well you know now that we have this we don't need these short term policies anymore you know and they kind of let them linger but they were really careful to say look they only last for three months and maybe it was basically they didn't want people buying these policies in part because a lot of people would buy them\nAnd not realize they were basically buying like a piece of junk coverage or something close to it [laughter] well you know the Trump Administration came in and they want it to repeal the Affordable CARE Act I wanted to get rid of all these regulations that made you know car brands of insurance\nAvailable to everyone regardless of pre existing condition they couldn't do it right I mean we we all remember last year you know John McCain John McCain with a thumbs down and they failed to pass a law so they've been trying to figure out ways to\nAction and and someone had the idea that well gee what if we just let more people buy these these other ... short term policies and basically they lifted the restrictions on them so you can basically take out one of these policies now\nAnd keep it for a whole year and renew it and um [noise] you know the idea is that these policies if you can get one they're going to be a lot cheaper but that's because they cover a lot less and if you get sick you're going to be in real trouble and if you're already sick you won't be able to get one\nRight and and and that's the thing so is it that the short term plans are really good if you are basically healthy\nYeah I mean you know I I don't know if I were that I had to take even to say they're really good if you're basically healthy um because the reality as we all know is that you're healthy until you're not healthy right right well\nWhat I should have said Johnson was they're not they're less expensive or healthy\nAbsolutely and look if you if you're healthy right now and you buy one of these and you know you you go through the year or however long you hold U.S policy and you don't get a serious illness and you don't break your arm and you know you don't have a kid born with a congenital disease and yeah you know you'll look you're bang bang balanced than at the end of the year you'll have more money um\nBut you know that's that that's that's a that's a that's a roll the dice and it's a big roll the dice and the thing is you know look I cover this is my beat right healthcare I mean I've been reading about this for almost Twenty years right now I ... I went through one of these policies and the guy and I don't understand all the exclusions [noise] um\nI I there's just no way people buying these policies most of them really understand what they're getting and in part because most people in their heads they know that Obamacare is still the law they know the Affordable CARE Act is still there so there's an assumption\nThat you know if you buy insurance is going to cover what you need and you know the plans have to have a disclaimer and it's in the fine print but I can tell you I even got a telemarketing call from one of these companies and I can tell you it's very confusing and I I I'm willing to bet money that a huge number if you will find names won't know what they're getting and that's not pure conjecture because in the old days that used to happen\nAll the time and insurance commissioners would get flooded with complaints\nSo let's talk about the president's op ed that was published in USA Today\nOn Wednesday today\nAnd it's been slam um buy lots of fact checkers\nAnd other folks as being filled with false hoods and mischaracterization that some might even say lives but in his op ed he slammed the Democrats were taking away health care and trying to turn America in Venezuela and in and he also claimed that he wants to protect people with preexisting condition\nUm ... what's really what is the president's record on that\nI I you know that's a total lie I mean that I I don't really know how to say and um I actually try not to use the word lie except in cases where I think someone actually actually knows they're not telling the truth is deliberately missing the people and I think this is one of those cases um you know a\nPresident Trump spent last year\nTrying to push through that repeal legislation and repeal legislation um would have undermined the existing protections for pre existing conditions now it had some features in there that you know they threw when if you may remember back when when they were writing the bill they said well\nYou know we'll have a special provision you know for example won't actually let insurance companies deny coverage because of a preexisting condition but you know they would still let you know it you know they would let in certain cases they will that insurers charge more right so yeah you have diabetes and\nThey can't deny you coverage but they can charge you a lot more for it so much they couldn't afford it so that's you know that's effectively the same thing I mean he talked to any expert they will tell you can't have just one piece of the pre existing protections you have to have them all together so you know that's what he was doing last year and now this year\nAn image we were just talking about the junk insurance a regulation that undermines protections for pre existing conditions but there's even more crystal clear example which is ...\nA federal lawsuit it is I it is a crazy loopy you will be hard pressed to find a respectful legal experts who think it has things that has any merit but there's a lawsuit that was filed by some conservative Republican state officials\nCalling on the federal courts to throw out a the protections for pre existing conditions\nAnd normally in normal times when someone sues uh just declare federal law unconstitutional the Justice Department defense that law in court and doesn't matter\nWhether the administration likes it or not that's\nThe way the system works at the Justice Department it's unless you know allies like agree jealously unconstitutional you you defended the Trump Administration you know this is the Trump Administration they don't do things like people usually do it they just had a nope we're gonna we're not only we are not only will we not defend the law we're going to file a brief\nIn support of the plaintiffs so they are the Trump Administration right now has its name on a lawsuit asking a federal judge to throw out the protections for pre existing condition so I don't know how you can have\nYour name on that lawsuit and then get up and you know USA Today or well you know Fox News or wherever and say hey I Want to protect preexisting conditions I mean this is just you know this is crazy\nWell let's talk about the politics of what happened today in in the Senate and this bill um unlimited unlimited resources from health care plans was being pushed hard by the Democrats the Democrats are in the minority in the Senate and even though this this bill went down and only went down by\nBy one vote a fifty fifty and the vice president of president of the Senate\nCertain tasks the the defining boat but why did the Democrats push this bill was it up your political above your political ...\nWell I think you know uh when you're in the minority at the Democrats are are you are always in the position of trying to propose legislation that's gonna not ... that's going to have a very slim chance of passing now I think they thought they had a good chance of getting it through the Senate I mean as you said they came up one vote short\nThey did get Susan Collins from Maine to supported that got them to fifty they did not get Lisa Murkowski who was the other obvious candidates to do it [noise] um I think they had real hopes of getting it through the Senate now obviously\n\n\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday October Nineteen\nGets election the then Wisconsin Public radio in going beyond the ballot we want to

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[laughter]\nI'm trying to think Kay part and you're listening to America on the line from WNYC radio and public radio stations across the country this is a show about politics in the mid term elections and\nNow the election day is twenty seven days away we want to check in on key races here what the candidates are talking about and share some of their notable commercials still with me in Studio to do that or Brian Lehrer host of the Brian Lehrer show and WNYC\nAnd Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell before we jump into calls and commercial Brian you want it in on what we're talking about in the at the very end of the last segment about the fed yeah and the president attacking the fed\nFix I think that the tension that's going on in the markets right now shows how the interests of workers and the interest of owners are sometimes at odds and raises the question which one is the government including the fed\nI'm going to favor this happened back in the nineties as well unemployment would go down\nThe fed would raise interest rates so that unemployment didn't go down\nTo quickly uh and spark inflation and progressive set that time what how all at the fed for raising rates because it was like the fed Alan Greenspan in those days wanted enough unemployment why does he want workers to be out of jobs that's not progressive\nAnd if we're looking at Trump now putting pressure politically on the fed is hardly unique I pulled out this article for ...\nBill Clinton was taking office for the New York times and it says Mr Clinton and the governors of the fed or on a collision course because of the central bank wants economic growth to continue its slow takeoff\nHoping to keep inflation heading downwards the Mr Clinton's advisors have a quite different goal for faster economic growth to fulfill his campaign pledge sound familiar\nYeah but I mean I don't know where we did you say that President Clinton did President Clinton directly attack the fed\nNo it was it was Leon Panetta with one of his official right as a job is to remove yeah with who job on the fed and he was on largely um\nAdmonished for that by economists and others who said\nWe again we need the fed to maintain its credibility it has been ... hard won credibility one over the decades and you can make that disappear quite quickly if you don't believe that the fed is independent if you believe that the fed is subject to the day to day political when\nI'm Out of the populace and can be sort of strong arm into doing what's politically expedient for the guy in the White House so actually after that those comments were made\nAnd and I think that actually makes me kind of a couple of times\nUm there was some sort of rule implemented within the White House saying okay from now on we're not going to publicly comment\nOn fed policy now or the value of the dollar and various other things that you want there to not be any political meddling in I'm In for the most part administrations have stuck to that although there have been some deviations including many more recent\nTimes they as you were speaking of bunkers singing those were the days was rolling through my head let's go back to the question that I asked a listeners at the beginning of the show this Medicare for all seemed like a good idea or one of those too good to be true promises that politicians can't really deliver on\nAsked you to call for for seven four or five eight to five five Ben in West Chester thank you for calling into America on the line\n[noise] Hi how are you can you hear me yes I can okay thanks for taking my call I think that I have three points out I'll Try to be quick one I think it's funny that this has\nBecome such a partisan issue I mean we have the right that's very far or against it and the left is\nIs for it in France my wife is from France my son was born in France which is not a right or left issue you can be very far away to the anti immigration anti euro zone 'em but\nYou love your health insurance you that that's something that they can agree on\nAnd I know that this was going to sound bad but I'm sure if we were to kind of ... down a Americans throat so to speak and universal health care which is something that we accepted\nLike you go to church on Sunday and when you're Twenty one is a tricky we can continue to fight about everything from immigration and abortion and gun control but we will have this thing that really works very well we have an example of that\nUh the second point is that a is a law suits on the medical insurance so what happens in in France when my son was work so I had a son born here in France was on\nA born in uh in New York a midwife delivered a my son they don't have an OBGYNs see the thing the philosophy and the French system if you will as you've ... you've tried to provide the best quality\nCare at the cheapest price having an OBGYN there is a very uh extensive\nWe're more C sections in ... in America than we do in France why because people are afraid of getting suit my son was very sick the other day he was like vomiting a lot the doctor said okay just taken here I guess you can see our that might be expensive why does doctors say that because of one percent chance that something bad happens to my son he's\nGoing to get to that just doesn't work that way then within thirty points\nSo the third point in a small business owner\nSupport for WPRI comes from boardman car a Wisconsin law firm dedicated to the art of listening and the power of informed discourse serving businesses individuals and local governments throughout the state board ... dot com\nThey had cancer prices skyrocketed and now I literally have to pay more taxes people don't understand the effects of this there are companies that large companies were it was American Airlines were usually the legacy that they have to pay for older people as yours or not who no longer work for them I don't think the universal healthcare is good\nFor business and it's not good for individuals excuse me the current system fan\nI I Want to thank you very much [laughter] been going out of wherever you live in a lot of material Ryan Catherine dive in\nWell my two kids were both delivered by mid was\nWith a doctor on call if something went wrong and it was better for humanity a kind of you know human scale with my wife and me and it was cost effective so I support the story that he told with respect to ... but\nOn the larger point there's a basic tension in healthcare economics whether you go liberal or conservative that there are so much medical technology available in the modern world\nWe could spend an infant and the amount of money to cover everyone for everything so every society ration health care but you can rationalize why Canada or against France where basically everyone is covered for all the same things and they have to decide how much they're willing to be taxed versus how much they're willing to go without\nFor the most part you know everybody gets to the same things that are denied the same things preexisting conditions is not an issue because everyone is just covered\nIn this country there's a tension between these two ideals that the two parties hold Democrats want insurance to be comprehensive which means insurance costs more Republicans want cheap insurance to be available which means it will cover less\nAt one point that I Want it to make that a sort of came through in this caller's comments is that to have universal healthcare you don't need to have single hair\nAnd I think that gets lost in the debate quite a bit actually ... ... you know all other major industrialized countries have universal health care they do not all have single payer they have some ... some patchwork system\nI'm of private insurance and public insurance or they might require a people to get tempted by one of a set of plans but but most of those countries do not have single payer and the\nProposal that is generally on the table here on the left\nIs this term Medicare for all are single pair and there are a lot of other ways\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday October

I Want you to explain what you mean by the jungle grows back and I want you to expand\nOn on this one lie that's on page nine of your of your book you say that the creation of the liberal order has been an act of defiance against both history and human nature\nTalk more about that\nWell sure I mean you know if you think about the great a sweep of human history or most people have lived under tyranny and poverty and in the state of constant warfare that's pretty much the story\nOf humankind going back as far as recorded history and I'm sure back before that as well\nUm and the period that we've been living in since the end of World War two a has been entirely different that's been a time of incredible prosperity we've seen four billion people\nMove out of poverty into the middle class or it's been a period of incredible explosion of democracy and like the world has never seen before and it's also\nA been a period of great power peace we didn't have the kind of world wars that we saw 'em in the first half of the twentieth century so it's an extraordinary period but we have to understand that historically it's an aberration\nUm and the point I Want to make is that it really requires active efforts to sustain it because nature in a sense\nA wants to tear it down in the international system or the national order is chaos and conflict um and you know human beings don't necessarily go toward democracy so this is something that requires active efforts we've done it for a long time and we need to continue to work at it\nIn fact you write if the liberal order is like a garden artificial in forever threatened by the forces of nature preserving it requires a persistent\nOn ending struggle against the vines and weeds that are constantly working to undermine their from within and overwhelm it\nFrom from with out of you know later on in the book you talk about the fact that you know Americans actually question why their country needs to be so deeply involved in the rest of the world this is something\nThat while President Trump ran on that you know in America first agenda this that sentiment predates President Trump doesn't it\nIt does I think ever since the end of the Cold War I think Americans have been asking why they need to shoulder this enormous burden of ah of sort of maintaining peace and prosperity and the liberal world order and it's not surprising that they would because it really is\nAn unusual role of ... no country in history has ever played it before and I think most people thought that when the Soviet Union collapsed that they really we really didn't have to continue doing that\nI'm a unfortunately the sad reality is we're seeing all around us the jungle does grow back there are all kinds of bad actors out there and if the United states does not continue to play this role then eventually the jungle overwhelms us and even overwhelms Americans\nAre one of the things that you and I've talked about this before [noise] excuse me and you've talked about the fact that um the United states ... at least within the last Seventy years if has not been eggs quote unquote normal nation what is a normal nation [noise]\nWell a normal nation is a nation that looks afterwards so first and really only most nations in the history have looked after their own of security in their own economic well being and I'm not taking\nResponsibility for a larger world order and the key word here is responsibility you know people talk about Americans being isolationists they're not isolationist they're\nAlways heavily involved in the world the question is\nDo they want to take responsibility for maintaining a certain\nChallenge and it it it does require\nAll it's costly it costs lives and\nIt also has a moral burden because when you exercise power it's impossible not to exercise and to some degree a morally it's the nature of exercising power so it's entirely understandable that Americans would want us to offload this responsibility unfortunately in the world is configured on such a way that\nIf Americans do offload that responsibility than we had\nBackwards chaos and disorder and tyranny and all the things that we saw\nBefore the United states began playing the role\nNow you write and towards the middle of the book about how there are rules of the road here with this a liberal small D democratic uh order that um we've been living under for for Seventy years and that basically it's a sense of fairness um that\nEven though the United states is the a military power and and and an economic ... power by and large it doesn't use its power to run roughshod over other members of the of the global order do I have that right [noise]\nYeah so I'm a ... and I want to hasten to to uh make clear that that doesn't mean the United states doesn't sometimes take advantage of its power it doesn't mean that we're not selfish it doesn't mean we're not how critical it doesn't mean we don't make terrible mistakes because where humans and that's just the nature of these the by and large the order we created in order to be successful\nHad to be one in which the other members felt that they were getting a fair shake that we weren't exploiting are enormous power to sort of get it over on them and when every deal I mean we allowed Germany\nTo do better than we were doing in the production of automobiles read aloud Japan to do better than we were doing in some areas of technology at one time or another and that was part of the deal in a way Japan and Germany gave up their geopolitical ambitions which is led the two world wars and an exchange they were allowed to thrive economically\nUm so they ended up deal only works if if if there is a kind of level playing field and the economic realm especially\nNow when when you and I talked to a for my contacts with the Washington Post earlier this year you said something that I found an intriguing you said when President Obama ran and was elected he correctly believe that the American people wanted to kind of retrenchment of American involvement in the world and he carried that\nOut in what way did he carried that out [noise]\nWell look I mean if you think about the fact that I think a President Obama believes he was elected and I think rightly so uh to get America out of the wars in Iraq and I think in Afghanistan although he didn't fully succeeds from doing that um and not to get into any other wars and so\nUm you know I think we made a mistake and not doing more in Syria and we paid a big price for it because that the refugee crisis out of Syria has destabilized Europe but\nI Believe that Obama President Obama believes that the American people do not want to get more deeply involved in Syria and so he didn't I think he also tried to make it clear to our lives that while the United states you didn't go as far as Trump has gone in sort of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
