P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n\n[noise] from WNYC radio I'm Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line a news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWhere here every Monday through Thursday with the latest political news analysis and your calls in response to our questions to you and this is the question right now\nDo you want a candidate whose messages uplifting and unifying or do you want to vote for someone who promises to fight who promises to go low when they go low\nGive us a call at eight four four seven four or five talk that eight four four seven four or five eight to five five you can also send us a tweet using the hash tag eight O. T. L. tonight we begin with jobs\nDeputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein gets to keep his after a meeting with the president on air force one Mr Trump said he gets along very well with Rosenstein and this evening at the White House justice Brett Kavanaugh was sworn into his new job on the Supreme Court\nYes you're right he was actually sworn in on Saturday by chief justice Roberts and yes this event tonight was purely ceremonial\nSome including the conservative Washington conservative Washington Examiner describe it as part of the Trump victory lap over the cabin on ... confirmation if you'd like to be finished with the cabin our conversation and move on to the issues you care about most\nMaybe tell that to the president\nHere's what he said at the White House a short while ago\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the cabinet or a family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process\nAnd here's what do you have to say this morning\nOh I've been hearing that now they're thinking about their pay when\nYou're a man that there's nothing wrong a man that was brought up and hope that was set up by the Democrats using the Democrats lawyers and now they want to jump I've heard that for many people I think\nThose are the American public and I think given to see a lot of things happen for November sex that would that have happened\nFear and loathing in lots of anger is that what the political conversation is going to be the next month is that a winning message for Republicans Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell thinks oh\nUh the tactics are being employed vote a Judiciary Committee or Democratic senators and by the you know the virtual mob this will solve all of us in the course of this process\nHas turned our very own far always talking to my political advisors yesterday about the advantage of these guys by their tactics are given to us going under these rich very competitive races\nBut how is it playing in the real world particularly with women voters joining me now to answer that question or two veteran strategist Chris\nOr an author of the selfie vote where millennials are leading America and how Republicans can keep up and also in Washington is former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton Karen Finney who's currently a senior advisor to the Democratic National Committee and the Stacey Abrams for governor of Georgia a campaign\nKristin and Karen welcome to American on the line\nThanks for having us hey Johnathan okay so um how is senator McConnell's um\nThe arising that this is quoted what turned out turned our a turn our base up turned are based on fire how's that playing criminal start with you\n[noise] well I think he's right in the sense that for Republican voters\nThe issue of the Supreme Court is something that really unifies the party gets the base energized it's the sort of thing where even when Donald Trump was just the nominee a divisive figure within the Republican Party it was the promise of a more conservative Supreme Court that brought the party together behind him\nSo I think when it comes to the question of has this energize the Republican base I I think the answer is probably yes but of course for every action there is often an equal and opposite reaction and so you know has this made it harder for Republicans in say swing districts with lots of\nUh you know college educated female voters for extra fired up this year there there may be some blowback in some places too but I certainly think when he says this is something that has activated in unified Republican voters and it seems to me the data says he's right about that so far\n... what's your view Karen I think what it said what we're seeing so far and we saw this a little bit uh going into a last\nWeek and then sort of the polling coming out of last week that it's motivated Republican men\nAre I think what we're seeing with regard to women again college educated white women\nWho had previously been with the president and with the Republican Party already over the summer we're starting to move toward leaning towards democratic candidates and if you look at some of the data coming out of last week it appears that that\nHas not changed so the climate still favors Democrats\nBut I think what you have seen is and I think it's hard to know how much of this is is a cabinet and how much of this is the fact that it is\nYou know getting closer and polls are tightening in or and people are starting to pay more attention when we're also seeing Republicans are actually become more energized and motivated up more broadly so I think we still you know to get such a volatile electorate and I think it's a little bit difficult to\nTease out exactly what's causing which\nOkay so there's a new CNN poll that shows that the President Trump's approval rating among women the way I should say disapproval among women for President Trump is that sixty two percent\nAnd this is a an a number of that's coming on the heels of polls last week showing a huge gender gap\nUm for the Republican for the Republican Party\nAm I wrong to think that what is happening here between the victory lap in the East Room of the White House earlier earlier this evening\nI'm Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sort of saying that this has all been very good very good for the base that they're trying to trying to make us believe something that actually isn't happening\nI think that's I think that's absolutely possible you know I'll tell you Jonathan as you also as you know I also serve on the board of ... pro Choice America\nAnd as you know one of the can we that organization we've been out front a leading the charge against ah the cabinet nomination and one of the things that we've seen in a number of racist\nWomen are increasingly concerned about what will happen to roe v Wade and not as we saw earlier in the summer in some instances in governors' races you had voters saying particularly women voters saying they would want a governor who would protect roe versus Wade if there was a chain on the court\nSo one of the things that we've just launched as an initiative to educate people on the possibility that abortion could be criminalized we've also a narrow is just also launched\nA million dollar targeted TV and a digital advertising campaign in specific races so I think I think you're right in that McConnell is trying to make it so which is that you know something we see if if sometimes where it'll try to say it to make it so\nBut uh I think again I think women are very motivated and they're motivated around understanding what the stakes are in the next I think in this\nMid term election it feels a lot higher than it has an in previous elections mid term elections so\nChristian ... go ahead but I also want to jump on something Karen said is is McConnell ... as Karen said he's trying to say it to make it so uh do you agree with that is that how you view it from your vantage point\nI don't think that this is just ... is just spin coming from folks like Mitch McConnell I think they really believe this is you know in a year where we were seeing ... prior to the last couple of weeks you know a pretty significant advantage for Democrats in terms of voter enthusiasm scene that gap clothes\nI don't think it's just spin for four Republican leaders to say hey has this been the thing that has helped close that gap\nI I Do think the political environment is different from that the national level versus some of these key Senate states which is another reason why I think Mitch McConnell has some reason to be a you know more upbeat about the political fortunes 'em spilling over from this this confirmation story\nYou know it may be the case when you take a look at these polls on balance on the question of support or oppose the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I tend to be more opposed than support by you know typically mid to high single digit margins\nAccording to Kristen and Karen you can but what do you think call us at ... for for seven four or five eight to five five you're listening to America on the line\n[noise]\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday October nineteenth\n[noise]\nThe programs that we hear we want to continue to use those and we know that that's part of the\nFinances of WPRI I was walking through our human resources department and I saw their little brochure they can match our donations that we give to WPRI it was just so easy\nI'm Marcia from Russia Wisconsin and even though I'm retired my former employer century insurance continued to match my donations to WPRI and I hope your company does to\nSupport for WPRI comes from northern sky theater in door county with Muskie love a comic musical fish tail

government agencies in all fifty states more information is at S. A. S. dot com slash galls sass the power to know\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line and news and call in show about the mid term elections joining us from Miami is Rolling Stone senior writer Tamil Smith and still with us from Washington are Republican pollster Kristen ... Anderson and democratic strategist\nKaren Finney we were talking about a rage uh raised as a result of the Kavanaugh\nA confirmation process and swearing in the comments from the president or both this morning and just earlier this evening a during the ... the second swearing in of now justice Kavanaugh\nAnd I want to get more into um women's rage at at this point and senator Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a address the issue of whether she was angry about what was happening here's what she said\nI Am angry [laughter]\nAngry women who has been slow down and shut out one [noise]\nShe goes on to say I am angry because of everyone who has lost power a junk mail and I'm going to bring in a Christian and caring into this the the women's raised the anger of women it around\nUh to Dr Christine Blasey Ford in this confirmation process the response of now justice\nBrett Kavanaugh if you listen to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or even the president the the rage that is being expressed felt and expressed by women is immaterial if not ignored\nMhm well the thing is you're you have to understand that\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party has successfully weaponized victimization\nAnd they have made it a commodity to and which to market themselves they said that I'm going to make you feel like you have something to be mad about even if you are in fact part of a privileged class\nAnd if in fact you are the white person in West Virginia or any number of states that have you know\nPoor schools and low paying jobs are no jobs um we're going to give you somebody to blame for that and so\nThat that fact is inextricably from this debate about anger and rage uh you have to we have to understand that\nThere are a lot of folks who have been angry for very very long time and find very good reason to be and it is in the interest of Trump and McConnell to ignore them it's not something that they simply do because maybe they're ... or because they really behind ... and went to see their conservative goals reached\nThey have a a real reason to ignore the people that are coming out to them and I think it's really convenient way of of the legitimate causing a your your opponent rather than actually having to deal with what they're saying\n... what do you make of what your meal just said [noise] so I think\nThat right now and I I don't want to take credit for this insight it was one of those things I saw on Twitter and and I actually thought that it was it intelligently phrase but it was that\nRight now you have I think in both parties a feeling of sort of victimization that derives from the really big in balancing power that both sides of the political spectrum have in terms of political indoor cultural power the idea that that the right\nHas control as Ken mentioned earlier in the shadow of the White House Congress now the Supreme Court and yet has very little power and the cultural arenas in the U.S the political conservatives feel like\nI Can't say merry Christmas without coming under fire you know the late I Can't turn on late night comedy without you know feeling like my way of life is under threat I feel like a stranger in my own country similarly for Democrats and they they enjoy I think quite a bit of sort of\nA power in the cultural realm and that where Americans moving culturally is quite in line more in line with where they're at and yet it's not reflected in the political reality in the sense that hey we make up this huge portion of America and yet we feel like our voices are being hurt in the political arena\nKaren so it's that imbalance oh sorry it's just conceded that imbalance that leads in both parties to feel like\nThey are not they do not have the voice they deserve\nWell I think there was a couple of things we need to separate out here right on the one hand with women because remember\nMe I have a cold we've seen women are\nRunning for a long long before Kavanaugh's before the Supreme Court we saw women running for office at record numbers turning out and making the difference in a special elections in twenty Seventeen and earlier and twenty Eighteen in record numbers particularly black women right\nI don't want us to get to a place where we're ... slating what's happening now in the rage and the anger that women are expressing with something that was already happening which was an expression I think more of women saying okay\nI'm going to put my hat in the ring and I'm going to step up and I'm going to I'm going to do this I'm going to run for uh\nChanges that I Believe need to be happening are happening what I think is is happening now though is this very searing moment and it really you know the me too moment and now we've you know we've experienced in the last week it really it crosses race it crosses\nA you know a ... parts of the country it crosses party lines in terms of Mac cannot tell you how many women that I Know from ... all kinds of backgrounds who have just been so what we say triggered\nBy you know listening to Dr Ford because too many of us as women myself included have too many experiences that are similar it and it ranges all the way from um\nYou know harassment to assault um and just that feeling of powerlessness um I I think it is part of what is now driving a rage and an anger that women feel\nSimilar to kind of what we saw Nineteen Ninety two where ... where we were the feeling was hey we need more women in office because we're the ones who are going to bring about the change uh\nThat changes that we need it's unfortunate therefore there was a woman who kind of stabbed us on the back that's another story in the cabinet vote\nSo I I think there are some different things and this is all happening against the backdrop of as we know from the twenty sixteen election a growing cultural anxiety or in this country the ... you know as the country becomes more diverse um\nAs women continue to rise in the ranks although we still haven't quite gotten there and particularly black women so I just think there's a number of different forces that are kind of\nComing together at the same time that are impacting you know why women are feeling more motivated both to run for office to get out and vote a and I and the numbers that we're seeing that I think well actually turn out and vote and make the difference in the number of election\nLaw if there are women out there who are who are listening who as a result of what's happening happened over the weekend and certainly over the last few weeks or with with Kavanaugh if you are so angry that you are more motivated today than you were a couple of weeks ago give us a call ... for for seven four or five eight to five five\nAh would love to hear from you right now we have Linda\nIn West bend Wisconsin Linda thank you for calling into America on the line\nHi thanks for taking my call\nSo I'm an or what are you hearing from from your friends are what are you thinking right now in terms of anger Ralph\nVote ... to ... Smith who is in Florida and we're gonna have to have you come back you know so you can talk about the Andrew Gillum campaign which is why you are there but I Want to thank you for coming on today and stay tuned we're gonna come back from a quick break\nOn America on the line [noise]\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday October Nineteen\n\nWisconsin from the television has an all his channels met in place the kids to learn and grow and have fun while they are and then this constant PBS Kids ... channel I mean all the time quality educational television children know and love twenty four hours a day cleaning sesame\nStreet curious George and Daniel tigers neighborhood\nThat's going to see them you can watch them over the air or seen them anytime anywhere\nAt Eighteen or\nSupport for WPRI comes from the children's hospital of Wisconsin foster care program\nTo helping thousands of Wisconsin foster kids connect with caring families more about being a foster parent is that C.

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[laughter]\nJonathan Capehart in this is America on the line from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWas today a holiday where you live do they call it Columbus Day or indigenous people's day\nIf you're in Columbus ohio you didn't have the day off to today was not a holiday there\nPhoenix Minneapolis Vermont and numerous other places mark the day as indigenous people's day Christopher Columbus of course did have a major impact on the history of the United states just not the role many of us were taught in school\nColumbus his arrival on our shores is where the history historian Jill Lepore his new book about America begins reporter who is a Harvard professor and a staff writer for the New Yorker\nHas written a very different kind of American history the book is called these truth and I spoke to her during the peak of the historic drama surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\n... welcome to America on the line hey thanks so much for having me you write in your book that the American experiment rests on\nQuality natural rights and sovereignty of the people how's it working out\n[laughter] well that is the\nQuestion and one of the arguments I make in the book is that that was an experiment right these truth or self evident in court in the declaration of independence\nBut they are meant to be the subject of continuous inquiry that the\nUnwritten statement of the declaration of independence nations also founded on the spirit of inquiry so that is actually the question we're supposed to keep asking ourselves how is that working out so that we can make adjustments or so that we can reform or revised or amend or\nCommit revolution whatever it is that is required if we believe those choose to be the ones on which a good government should rest\nSo these trends which I'm In a way it's a bowl title because arguably whether these days we hold any truth to be self evident but you would argue that it's not just the current political and social climate and this is an ongoing struggle in America [noise]\nSure I mean it's a long standing struggle in the United states to realize the promise of the nation's founding ideals\nThe broader system a logical crisis like how does anyone know what they know anymore that's not an American thing and has a particular manifestation and our political arrangements since we live in a democracy in which citizens in order to cast reasonable valid ballots have to have sufficient information\nTo make a good decision and whether we can or cannot do that any longer is I think a a big question\nThis history begins with Columbus his voyage and fourteen Ninety two which may seem at first like a history of the Americas but rarely as are beginning point of us history why did you choose Columbus as a starting\nPoint yeah so I'm One of the things I wanted to do and writing this book was try to a cross the divide and that divide\nIn terms of how we understand the American past\nIs between a a very traditional kind of great man theory of American history\nThat in fact traditionally begins in this weird fictitious way with Columbus as if he's an ancestor\nUh and then kind of hops from great man to great meant a great man all the way down to the president mainly up to the present mainly stopping at presidents and a kind of counter tradition which is the sort of social history and history of political movements in a conflict among groups\nA that's a history that more conventionally now would begin with the indigenous peoples of America going back a several centuries if not millennia\nTo chronicle a to people in the Americas from Asia and then would you know proceed in would sort of set Columbus to one side he might ... a minor character and the whole store would be sort of about um ... the experiences of a different groups in conflict with other groups right\nIdeologically those two very different histories roughly do map on to our political positions right the one is quite conservative telling of the American straight in the other is is the progressive or liberal telling of the American story\n... ... I think it actually is a huge problem to have such a polarized passed right like that you can't move forward a\nFrom a position of polarization when you can't even talk about a common shared passed in any meaningful way so I don't subscribe to like Columbus the great discovered narrative um\nBut I Begin with Columbus because I think for a lot of voters that is that's where they're expecting story to begin and then I pull away from that task like how do we ... what do we know about Columbus and what do we know about the people that he met and uh well how do we understand asymmetry of historical record what does it mean\nWho lived and died when some people left written records that we need to have survived and other people's entire cultural history was destroyed willfully are and how do we reckon with that 'cause 'cause all those people are and they're equally ancestors there is no lesser version of who is an ancestor of\nYou know what becomes the United states so I'm trying to kind of mix those things up and actually demand of the reader thinking about why why these two explanations both have a explanatory force\nYou write 'em in the truth is a very compelling um\nParagraph you write a nation born and revolution bull forever struggle against chaos and an issue in born in contradiction liberty in a land of slavery sovereignty in a land of conquest will fight for ever over the meaning of its history\nIt this jumped out at me particularly because of the time that we're in now in the maker ... make America great again\nA time that we have as the ... of of President Trump [noise]\nYeah and if you you look at recent political movements\nAnd certainly presidential campaigns they are all reduced simple or their reductive is essentially historical arguments make America great again is a historical argument it's an arguing about the relationship between the past and the future right so\nWas Obama's change you can believe in it is it is an argument about the relationship between the president and the future we have um\nYou know about you know famously said in his first inaugural we must choose are better history or their ... how we can figure ourselves politically is very much in conversation with our past\nAnd I think that's important and that is a a a part of how any people understand themselves but when the past is just simply used as a cudgel to sort of hit the other your political opponents\nThat is that I think contributes to our political does equilibrium\nOr you could have ended on so you start with Columbus and you could have ended on President Obama and the election of ... of President Obama which I'm a lot of people no matter their political persuasion would see that as an exclamation point on the experiment that is America's history but\nYou didn't you go right on the run on through why\nYeah I had always planned on ending on inauguration day in two thousand nine it's a beautiful scene it's completely compelling kind of drama courage ugly and since the book is insists on understanding\nA racial politics in front of the presidential politics like social movements and civil rights alongside\nThe development of parties if the book is really committed to integrating stories of American history instead of having like the march of the president's on one side and like side bars about Jim Crow or something book really is committed to thinking about race centrally and as as elemental Institute of American political arrangements from the very beginning\nIt was the right place to land you know yeah it also is this the kind of magic to that as an ending you know as a writer matter it is like", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "09"}
