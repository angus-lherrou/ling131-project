T. L. for America on the line\nWe're going to begin tonight with the latest news of the day and for that we turn to a ... who is Washington bureau chief for huff post thanks for joining us Amanda thanks for having me well let's start off\nWith uh the mess with a Saudi Arabia and we have a couple of a sound bite here here is the president who's asked a well you don't have you asked about that audiotape that that the Turks um apparently have showing or a recording the brutal murder and dismembered month of June ...\nWe've asked for if it exists prices haven't so I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does possibly the or I'll have a full report on that from my when it comes to\nYour mind being Mike Pompeo the secretary of state who went to Riyadh and after a photo op with a smiling handshake so with the with the crown prince\nSaid that um he didn't really want to talk about the specific this is what are the secretary of state said when he was asked well you know what did they say about whether democracy hoagie was alive or ... what ... what happened to him\nI don't want to talk about any of the facts\nThey they didn't want to either and if they want to have the opportunity to complete the investigation going to ... and I got I think that's I think that's I think that's a reasonable thing to do to given that opportunity and then we'll all get the judge will all get to evaluate the work that they do\nOkay so Amanda what was the point of that visit by Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia\n[laughter] I mean I think it was to give the appearance that the Trump Administration is taking this seriously a but\nIt didn't really come off that way pop tail a was shown in photographs of laughing at meeting with Saudi officials at the state department spokeswoman was\nAh put up on social media picture herself sort of sightseeing and ... that's not a great luck when you are over there investigating ... death of this journalist and I mean the Trump administrator ... seems like they are\nRight now looking for any way possible not to implicate the crown prince who has close ties to Jared Kushner for example a but it's becoming increasingly hard because all signs point to a hotbed solvent the crown prince and being involved\nWell there there's there's global outrage about this a lot of pressure even from Republicans in Congress to do something about uh the the murder of the Washington Post columnist but are they as they ... they had one of the Washington Post tonight says wait and see amid global outrage over 'cause she'll be trumped tries to protect the sound\nIt's wait until after the election but for now it seems like\nJeff Sessions is staying put I don't know for how long it doesn't seem that Rod Rosenstein is going anywhere after that initial scare a few weeks ago a mall or it's continuing to get cooperation from people and I think it's like you said it's just every single little bit quieter now and it's not much of a distraction\nAmanda thanks appreciate it very much let's bring in our panel joining me in the studio here in New York is Joan Walsh national affairs correspondent for the nation and CNN contributor an author of what's the matter with white people also in the studio Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham\nIn in Washington DC Ben diminish the founder and publisher of the federalist thanks for for joining me eh let's let's continue with the the the fallout from from the the murder of ... and I guess the question I Want to ask me I'll start with\nWith you Joan is is there any reason to think that this won't be a typical new cycle of of our era where two weeks from now we're going to be sitting here looking at one another say she remembered that story about the murder of of of the journalist whatever happened\nWith that I Hope not Charlie I mean I have to acknowledge that there's a possibility of it but this is so ah ... dreadful uh so so such a horrible thing uh to have happened to a U.S resident at it it really\nPains me to hear President Trump repeatedly say he's not a U.S citizen while he was a legal resident I'm saying was because I Believe he's dead or you know he works for the Washington Post\nA he is entitled to to the protection of our government and the way that the president continues to deflect an act like maybe it doesn't matter too much\nAlso he's a journalist so I you know for for good and bad reasons I think that kind of helped keep something in the news because we look after our own a but it also it is it's the first obvious foreign policy crisis for this president and\nAre the implications of of his actions so far are so disturbing I I think we'll be talking about this for a while I Do\n\n\n\nThis is the ideas network you're listening to America on

N. Y. sees United States of anxiety podcast\nWho's just back from a reporting trip to Georgia thanks for being an American ally thanks for every Charles well let's talk about this uh Stacey Abrams what makes her different I mean obviously you know on paper first boy you know black female governor of the state of Georgia give me some sense of what makes her this distinctive well first black woman to\nState and the history of United States uh so you I think you run out of things I could go we go all night on what makes her exceptional I mean there's there's who she is but then there's also what her strategy is is a ... if if she wins she will mark\nA dramatic change in Democratic Party politics for the south yeah mean up until now basically I mean there's the Democratic playbook is to run as a century right uh you know picking up swing votes in the middle ... she's got a different philosophy\nThey it's been to count on just count on a black um and people of color votes in Atlanta and other large cities and then to reach out into the ... serves a to get moderate whites\nStacey Abrams has spent a decade plus building a strategy for the party that is about a hundred and fifty nine counties I'm going all hundred fifty nine counties there are votes for me at all of those counties many of them are a majority black counties that the party just hasn't invested in hasn't tried to reach and she says I can mobilize as\nWell you actually interviewed Abrams herself and we're going to play a clip of her explaining that strategy in her own words\nClay county may have Fifteen people\nWho have that do that before I can get them engaged and they decide they want to vote they get added to five thousand folks in Clayton County\nWho also have that before and I had them to Fifteen to twenty thousand the cat county voters and over time what we do is develop the two hundred and fifty thousand votes leaning I Do not believe in ignoring a single voter because you\nCannot lead some of the people you have to be the leader for the entire state\nOkay so that that's the strategy but it it is working because right now five thirty ... polling website has has havens two points behind Republican Brian camper Republican opponent but that is just ...\nYeah in fact that she's in the race at all is remarkable at a at a testament to the strategy right I mean an end up kind of voters she's talking about\nUh you know are not people who show up in polls that's the point is these are these are not likely voters there many of them are registered voters which is an important point but they're not people who are voting a lot and they're not people that the party has tried to get out and so the question is can she get them out\nNow the big challenge for her campaign is twofold is that when you go into these rural counties one desperately poor and people have their backs against the wall it's really hard I met a woman in clay county where she's ...\nWho's one of the women who is trying to get out the vote she herself doesn't have a car\n[laughter] and so even the organizers don't have transportation to get around let alone a the voters themselves she's up against that and then this is where we get into the question about voting rights as 'cause she's also up against ah the fact that if you suppress a you know ten thousand votes\nA on a at a strategy like this that can that I Want to get\nTo that in a moment but what you're describing is a strategy that sets out to remake the shape of the electorate to to just ... reshape the models that we used to describe the American you know polling system political system\nParticularly in the south and again you know the Democrats you haven't won in Georgia in Twenty years they have to run the same strategy over and over and over again this labor ... Abrams campaign has been saying since the primaries and lost repeatedly\nOn this idea that you can convince these these former Democrats to be Democrats and she's like well no they're Republican you know but we do have Democrats all over the state they just happened to be black people in rural areas and let's go\nNow Joe and you've been down in Georgia as well\nI had I'd been there a lot and I you know one thing that also needs to be said is that Stacey Abrams did\nFace one lasted a ration of that old mindset that we've got to run first of all the guy to run a white candidate and we've got to appeal to white voters are in her primary she had a primary opponent she was put up by a lot of the white power structure\nShe crushed this woman ... wonderful woman Stacey Evans ... had a lot of potential still has but\n... percent of the Stacey Abrams got Seventy six percent of the vote she ... the white vote she carried a hundred and fifty three out of a hundred and fifty nine county so she kind of proved\nThat she can appeal to white voters as well and the lead my story that comes out tomorrow a is an interview with a very conservative Trump voter who's voting for Stacey Abrams largely because he thinks Brian Kemp is to put it in his words an idiot and he's very concerned\nThat they're not renovate Trump being campaign counter to extreme for Georgia and that you know Georgia is trying to attract the new ... or Amazon\nOr ... you know every every city has going for a Georgia has Coca Cola and dealt a has a good does business climate cares about it\nUh Brian Kemp promises to sign a religious freedom restoration bill Nathan Deal the conservative Republican right now he vetoed that bill because of fears of the business climate so that's another advantage she has is that she didn't draw someone who was trying to moderate you do are real Trump being extremist\nYou really couldn't find a race that better encapsulates ... where we're at\nPolitically than this I mean you really want to go to right yeah I suppose so but just ... ... ... ... in the persona Brian Kemp and the person of ... and in their strategies ... also had nobody wants was one of the primary uh but he out trumped the Republicans were\nWell earlier today we reached out to a one of the women who is working just for black women and politics her name is Linda car was a political strategist and cofounder of higher heights a nonprofit that supports political growth for black women Linda thanks for calling into WNYC\nThanks for having me will tell me about your organization yet\nSo higher heights for America is a national organization building the collective political power black woman from the voting booth to elected office as you know black woman continue to\nDemonstrate a that lead not only a influence in shape elections that oftentimes we decide them a yet and still the twenty three million black men in this country are underrepresented and under served um and so you know over the last couple of election cycles you've seen an increase\nIn black woman running for office and running winning and leading and oftentimes running winning and leading without the support of major institutions and still not raising 'em\nA campaign funds are like their counterparts but still protesting and winning on the ballot so\nThis is the fiftieth anniversary of Shirley Chisholm run an election Congress kind of holding her to be the first black woman to serve in the U.S house of representatives and we now are you know in a selection cycle where we will see a record number of black woman position to I'm\n[noise]\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you are listening to America on the line from WNYC as it happens returns on friday November second\n\nYou know that you can donate your own vehicle to support Wisconsin Public radio will use the proceeds to bring you all the programs you love\nAnd you'll get a tax deduction it's free fast and easy your own ride could become new interviews conversations in entertainment you're on the ideas network\nGold you WPRI dot org slash support to find out more and thank you [noise]\nSupport for Wisconsin Public radio comes from the URL am Terry endowment fund a permanent endowment that provides ongoing support to sustain the present and future operation of Wisconsin Public radio\nWisconsin Public radio covers the state you can get the latest news from WPRI delivered right to your email was WPRI news newsletters find out how to subscribe I going to WPRI dot org you'll never missed the story with WPRI newsletter\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

elections from WNYC in public radio stations across the country look you've probably heard the term tribalism to describe are deeply divided political landscape\nAnd most of us would say a reasonably thirty two tribes the ... the red truck Republican and Democrat or three tribes if you count in independence\nSo what if you were told there were in fact seven tribes but two of them roughly Fifteen Percent of us seemed to control the political dialogue for everybody else\nThat's the finding of a new study of eight thousand Americans that was launched by the nonpartisan organization called more in common they released a fascinating report called hidden tribes a study of America's polarized landscape and earlier today I spoke with one of the researchers Daniel Yergin thank you thank you for coming on the show thanks\nAmazing part of your study was how you describe the two groups with the most influence tell us about that\nYeah so what we have our two groups that really in total comprise about Fifteen Percent of the American population\nUm on one side you have the progressive activists that eight percent of the population there on the far left hand side on the right hand side you have the devoted conservatives those are also a smaller percentage of the population about six percent\nBut what's interesting is that those two groups despite the fact that they're actually a lot less than what you would consider the majority of the American population are making the most noise\nAnd that's really what's contributing to our sense of polarization in America today so these are the ... the loud mouth at the end of the bar whether I'd say that's it yeah and on social media on Facebook and Twitter all those things said it's got all of their race education economic status\nYeah so both of them are actually in terms of um socioeconomic status they're actually better off than you might expect so um you know I think that there are some times this narrative that people in the um\nThe people who voted for Trump or maybe the people who are on the far right side of the spectrum are are more working class but actually those are they're pretty awful on the right hand side and on the left so you have ... they are actually more likely to be white and more\nLikely to make an income more than the average American I'm both of those groups okay so did I did find the terms you're progressive activists what are they really concerned with how do they how do you define them these are people that are concerned with the typical idea of social justice these are people that are very active in the realm of\nUm sexual harassment about racism about immigration about things that are typically concerned um that you might see in um college campuses and this kind of thing where people are very very concerned about\nThe victimization of certain oppressed groups in minority more secular cosmopolitan highly engaged with social media exactly and when their their parents they value independence creativity in ... okay who does that that actually is a really important thing to parenting is very very interesting\nI don't know if you want me to just explain that a little bit yeah do you see this fascinating divide in terms of the way that the way the devoted conservative\nAnd progressive activists think about what's important when it comes to parenting\nSo on one side you have progressive activists that are really valuing these things have just curiosity creativity cell phone lines independence\nAnd on the other side you had when you ask people what's important when it comes to parenting you got a whole different set of values obedience they're devoted conservatives yes exactly the voter conservatives are the ones who are really endorsing the idea of obedience of um of respecting authority\nOf of of good behavior and good manners so it's just a very very different idea of what makes the good life of what makes people good human beings together it's\nAllowing the self to be to be free\nAnd to express itself or to ... that rules in authority and structure or the things that make for better and more civil aggressive activists are deeply concerned with equity in fairness devoted conservatives leaving aside parenting what is what are they most concerned about America's under siege yes exactly so they had the sense of a of a ... of uh\nThat American that they use that they used to know is slipping away\nAnd so these are people that are more concerned with the Christian white identity that they feel to be moving away from them they they have a sense of\nAnd like you know this is reflected in the fact that ... more than Ninety five percent of them support the idea of of Donald Trump making America great again not expressing his idea of a last America that they're trying to regain including these Christian values etc okay so what about what you call the exhausted majority you have these two\nRelatively small cohorts on the side and on the left in the right driving the debate who's digs exhausted majority so the exhausted majority sixty seven percent of Americans\nWith 'em that are defined by three most important view so this is a group of people ... their traditional liberals passive liberals politically disengaged and moderates those are the four groups that fit in the exhausted majority and these are characterized by three I'm really really important features first of all they're frustrated\nThey are very fed up with a polarization the back and forth that's going on in America\nA very their views their opinions according to issue in from issue to issue instead of entering straight down the line\nAnd then finally they're forgotten their voices just aren't heard as much as the people on the extremes and so these are the people when we talk to people so many people are falling in this exhausted majority people who want to move America for to have conversations and find common ground but you are able to do that because of the sense of\nOf of tribalism and polarization and division that's characterizing our discourse right now this is fascinating I think a lot of our listeners may feel like these two camps the you know that you know right and left the only party sucking up the air in the ... but\nBut what you're describing is that most of us actually have a more in common than not I think that's exactly what we found you know so we\nTalked to eight we interviewed a thousand Americans we conducted dozens of hours of focus groups in interviews\nAnd that's exactly what we see is that people are tired of this idea of caricature and the other side I think that that that's what often happens is people get this idea especially when we're interacting on social media of what the other side looks like\nAnd it's just not true when you get people in conversation when people are interacting you have an opportunity for them to see the humanity and to hear what the other person is saying and to recognize that those person's values are driving their behavior in a way that is is undermined by good faith idea of what America\nShould look like and not necessarily by ignorance by hatred by evil and by bigotry\nSo you say your your your study categorized people in seven different tribes so can you briefly explain the categories in the survey that the the hidden tribes of of America don't get into the weeds as some of that sure in a in a second but what what are the seven ... seven tribes yet from left to right um so in the lessons either the progressive activists\nOkay I'm going to tell you basically from from an order of left right ideologically speaking okay we have the progressive activists on the far left\nTraditional liberals on the next than passive liberals\nThan politically disengaged moderates traditional conservatives and finally devoted conservatives on the far right those are the seven tribes wasn't in between the traditional conservative and the devoted consider\nWhat is really devoted to yes well the the the difference is more in degree in ... rather than kind um between the traditional conservative and devoted conservatives both of them feel a sense of loss about American culture\nThey do send they do they are mostly are more likely to be Christian more likely to be white then the other groups um uh but uh what separates them is more just a sense\nOf of warfare so that people in the devoted conservative camp are very unwilling to see to want to cede any ground to the other side whereas the traditional conservative they still are ... are are I'm\nWanting to fight for their values but there are a little bit more open to compromise and the devoted conservatives\nThe devoted concern is if you ask them for example would you rather he lives a nation or defeat the evil inside our nation devoted conservatives are far more likely to say we need to defeat the evil inside our nation and that we need to heal as a nation so one of the striking things is that you know we talk about how racially divided the country is but how about your study\nSuggests tell me if I'm wrong about that or that the debate is being basically being driven by\nAngry white folks who are relatively affluent on both ends of the political here's that way that's that's on average I Want to be sure that you know to make sure that this was clear that it's a on average not I'm", "year":
