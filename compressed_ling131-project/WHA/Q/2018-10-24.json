P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n[noise] from WNYC radio and Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line a news and call in show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWhere here every Monday through Thursday night with the latest news analysis and your calls two weeks from tonight right now even will be getting the first results from what may be the longest midterm election cycle ever and while we haven't spent much time on this program discussing what the polls are saying\nWe're going to dig into the numbers tonight with one of the most respected pollsters in America but let's start with the news of the day with Washington Post columnist Christine MBA Christine welcome back to America on the line\nThanks for having me again so Christine news of the day and the big news of the day is\nThat the president once again um well actually last night declared that he's a nationalist let's take a listen to that again\nWants to frankly not caring about our country so much and you know what we can sort of\nReally we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nAnd today when given an opportunity to clarify what he meant ah Christine the president said it again what's going on here\nWell it's always a little bit difficult to say and this is actually a scary thing whether the president or actually just is ignorant um or if he knows what he's doing but in this case I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing when he calls himself a nationalist\nI'm sensibly I think he's using he says that he's using the word um to signify something sort of in the line of being America First which he said in the past\nUm but the word nationalist specifically hadn't fallen out of use because it's old fashioned I'm told that if you because we now associate that with white nationalist a white supremacy and racism and I think he's using this as a dog whistle um to those\nParts of his base that yes want a America First policies but are also a little bit more interested in racism than the average voter\nAre are there in in any indicators that it is actually working is do you think that this is one of the reasons why the president's job approval rating is we talked about a lot last night has ticked up in the latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll up to fifty I'm Sorry forty seven percent\nYeah you know it's it's a bit hard to say if this they using this specific word um but one of the things that we have seen in the run up to the mid term elections is that President Trump is really sort of leaning into almost the ugliest parts of his previous campaigns um yes the nationalist um\nAmerica First rhetoric that demonization of immigrants and people of color a kind of stoking fears an angers I'm among his base and his probable supporters and unfortunately as we have seen in the past several elections\nVoters than contentment does\nThe president is ... is also talking a lot about a middle class tax cuts that supposed to happen in a in a matter of weeks how is that possible when Congress isn't even in session\nIt's not possible okay [laughter] [laughter] it is not possible at all I'm\nPresident Trump has started saying this over the past out week or two um and it is confusing everybody who hears that because yes as you say Congress has not in session\nI'm the response from senators and congressmen who are asked about this as a general sense of confusion they usually try and put the question back\nTo the president and even when the president has been pushed to talk a little bit more about what this tax cut would be or what it would entail as he was a today with reporters in the oval office he\nCan't even explain what he means you know he can't define what the middle classes it's not entirely clear what this ten percent would look like or what effect it would have on the deficit or who would pay for it\nBut because you know that headline is reported oh possible ten percent tax cut for the middle class it is attractive at cheers voters a and I think the president knows that that's the message that's going to go forth not the nitty gritty details like Congress being getting session\nWas speaking of nitty gritty details or um other things that the president um and people in his administration have been saying uh is that um\nYou know this caravan that's making its way from Central America through Mexico trying to make its way to the southern border of the U.S Mexico southern border that there are middle middle Easterners and quote\nSomewhere in the middle of this seven thousand person crowd and when push to provide any kind of back up for this ... ... the president doesn't have any ... ... ... what's going on here if you can you can it all explain [noise]\nI mean honestly I think it's it's more of the same as the midterm elections are nearing and Republicans are realizing that perhaps they weren't as far ahead her as safe as they thought the president has really resorted to\nObvious false hoods I'm so yes we have this idea floated of mysterious middle class tax cuts that will appear from somewhere over the next two weeks um but then also making out this caravan um which in fact happens\nAlmost every year there was also wouldn't last year and it's usually um and reporters have said you know this caravan too is of mostly families with children who have sort of banded together to try and cross the border in safety uh that's why there are large numbers\nOf this is being painted by Trump and by his vice president Mike Pence today\nAs sort of an assortment of criminals there going back to that language about\nYou know Mexicans being rapists and sending their worst the idea that they're somehow terrorists hit in in this group of people\nObviously there is no basis for that support or no basis to support that but you know it's scary and again when you know we write the headlines unfortunately\nUh the headlines sake caravan it's coming or Trump says that there are terrorists in the caravan and that scares some people and then in flames his base and so it works even if there isn't a scrap of truth to it\nNo I'm going to ask you about something that is close to our hearts mine mine and yours as a opinion writers at the Washington Post and that is the the brutal murder of ... um\nIn the White House speaking to reporters today about Saudi Arabia and it's sort of rolling rolling disclosure\nI had a very bad original concept [noise]\nIt was carried a poorly and the cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover ups Percival bad deal should have never been thought of somebody really messed up that the worst cobra ever\nChristine they had a very bad original concept was carried out poorly what on earth is the president of the United states saying here\n[noise] [noise] well honestly he is making is very clear that he does not care\nAbout journalists about this particular event um or about you know cooling any of the very close ties that he has to the Saudi Government\nI mean this is something that's actually pretty typical of Donald Trump when you think about how he you know talked about things is not particularly interested in\nUm you know this wasn't an event to happen we see it perhaps is the death of our close colleague a as an event that has really struck fear into the hearts of journalists and dissidents or around the world one of a sort of rolling assortment of new and emerging threats against the free press\nA and to Donald Trump it's\nIt's just a concept um it's a deal and she is weighing yet you know not as the life of a person not as anything you know symbolic or important but\nWell what are the tradeoffs here or are we willing to actually risk saying anything to the Saudis about this probably not um it's an attempt to sound concerned and it's clearly not working\nAnd and the last thing I Want to talk to you about or is this potential meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir ... in Paris\nWhen they will all be in Paris on November eleventh ... ... this would mark I think the third meeting between the leaders of Russia and the United states why\nWell that is a very good piece of advice Jennifer Duffy from the cook Political Report thank you very much for being on America on the line and

O T L I might tell you how I might be feeling about all this but instead we will go to Holland in Columbus ohio colon\nAre you calling us I'm not going to win ... thanks for taking my call of course so where are you and the confidence scale confident and there are nervous about your side Miami I'm nervous I'm a Democrat and I'm\nI just think that this whole uh the confidence in blue wave is seen as like kind of a sluggish confidence by the right out like everyone just so confident that the blue is going to take over more win back the house that for failing to see like the circumstances that made Trump a viable option and the first place [noise]\nSo you so you think it's sort of um over confidence of of Democrats are as opposed to the president you know pulling out all the stops\nWhen he's sixteen and in ... up I'm the same kind of want to call it the excitement as he didn't when he succeeds\nRight well of course it's all that and you know is is based gets fired up on anything he does so like he basically he can't go wrong to them so people that are trying to think you're like\nWe got cheese ... yeah yeah that's all right Colin I Know\nIn in in in radios it makes me nervous to call and thank you very much for calling into America on the line common was calling in from Columbus ohio let's go further west in the mid west and go to John in is calling in from Fargo\nNorth Dakota Fargo a where my husband is right now full disclosure I'm helping with them centered high camp I'm John how are you confident\nHey how are you nervous I Am very confident I Want to go to shut up to the public radio that I'm a computer on right now of course and uh I I don't believe a single poll on the other than for hiding him no not in the past several months\nI don't think a natural foster know how to pull out here uh I think a lot on landlines but also about how those anymore are they old conservative people out here and I don't think it really takes into a college or whether it's\nCooked whether at five thirty eight or the retail politics that Heidi has been running and the campaign and the way strict representing the state passed six here\nSo if you no matter where you go in the states or you're going to find somebody that felt like they know Heidi because she gets out into the ... shows she is from one corner of the state to the other a nonstop\nRight I think that your tractor so so John I I I seem to remember that six years ago\nI'm Around this time of poll came out that said that ah Heidi Heitkamp was down ten points and she came back to win by one point so you are you are confident that she can pull that out again\nOut for like All right that out for you know I think it's going to be even given by the time when she got caught up on that she's about sixteen points\nUh last certainly headlines around here from great communication or just one of those corporations fat buying up all of the\nLocal affiliates and turn them into little mini a Fox News outlets I'm so that it's going to be a I I don't think we're going to know until election I but I definitely don't believe those kind of polls are out of state\nJohn thank you very much for calling in from Fargo North Dakota now it's time to bring independent if you've been paying attention to the campaign news you may have noticed a darker scarier tune in the last week or so we're just a few weeks ago the battles were being fought over who would or would not protect Americans with preexisting conditions\nNow it's about President Trump vowing that he and Republicans will protect Americans from lawless moms in the streets and Middle Eastern terrorists sneaking over the southern border Trump was asked asked again today whether there's any ... death\nThey said happens all the time in the middle east there those are the like the real bad [noise] but there will be there's [noise] there's there's no proof of anything\n[noise] there's no proof of anything maybe a sentence that describes a lot of what the president says but is it a winning strategy joining me now to talk about President Trump\nThey look bump national correspondent at the Washington Post in here in Studio with me is Jamie Floyd legal affairs correspondent for WNYC thank you both very much for being on America on the line\nHello so Philip ... can you and you've written about this ... ... is it really is\nAs simple as it seems the reason why in the closing weeks of the midterm campaign that the president is turning increasingly to a fear based campaign [noise]\nUm probably I mean it's sort of you know I'm generally low to ascribe really new on Fort\nStrategy to President Trump for a variety of reasons but I mean I think that not only does that make sense as an explanation particularly given the way that his spoken about so many tweeted just yesterday or the day prior to that\nYou know essentially that the caravan was an issue that you need to vote against the Democrats because of these these people were approaching the border um and he's been explicit\nIn saying that he is doing this for political reasons but yesterday I mean this is also the third election cycle we've seen Republicans really braces this strategy directly there was a twenty four teams\nSome race of people on Islamic state as he wanted to mention people from them and what have you seen from brands and fire campaign on this idea that America was\n... threatened that immigrants from terrorists were for for storing our shores and then all of it is none of it came to fruition obviously for a variety of reasons but this was this has been playbook pretty consistently\nMostly because they're not storming our shores [laughter] I mean the ... they go low we go lower\nThat that's the Trump approach to things President Trump approach to things and you know we've been here before I I've been a Jonathan spending much of my year in Nineteen sixty eight why would anyone want to go back to that turbulent year well because it's less turbulent then this year [laughter]\nOkay why I'm there um but but interestingly President Nixon President Nixon this is a page out of the Nixon play ball and and it you know ... I cannot I you know much like fill up I I I find it rather hard to believe that\nDonald Trump is spent much time reading uh biographies and and uh papers of of Richard Nixon but if you go back to the the a playbook of Nixon during a time when we had the voting rights act the civil rights act\nA rising liberalism and and and\nI have a feeling of a of of a ... a concern amongst a a wide sectors of the population ah that that we should perhaps a protect our white women and protect our our borders and concern ourselves with the other\nWell two weeks and so now we're going to have our answer Philip bump into me forward think he's been in America on the line Jamie you'll be back in a few minutes we're going to take a quick break coming up next to Eric Holder\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to America on the line from WNYC happens returns in its entirety on friday November second\n\nMy name's Jeffery Sachs city Wisconsin go to Arizona for wintertime voice sounded familiar to me there's\nThis news ... news and the rest of our knowledge and I sat there just got this warm glow and that's led me to prove Wisconsin Public radio will\nJust become home\nThey're more information about including WPRI in your state planned visit WNPR legacy dot org\nSupport for WPRI comes from the Wisconsin alumni association and the new alumni park\nFeaturing exhibits that honor the Wisconsin Idea lakefront green space and a variety of events and activities\nMore at alumni park dot com do you have a comment to share with WNPR contact our audience services department by sending a letter or a postcard to audience services Wisconsin Public radio eight Twenty one university avenue Madison, Wisconsin five three seven zero six\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nAnd Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line we've heard plenty of disturbing stories about how difficult some states have made it for some of their citizens to vote\nIn Georgia for example where fifty three thousand balance applications are in limbo because of a new law and other states like North Dakota Kansas Ohio having an acted laws that make it especially difficult for minority students and the elderly to vote\nFor former attorney general Eric Holder making it easier for people to vote and to have their votes count\nHas become his life's work he heads the national democratic redistricting committee and we sat down to talk about how it's going\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder welcome to America on the line it's good to be here thanks for having me so Democrats are focused on winning back\nHouse but you're focused on winning legislative and gubernatorial races\nWhy well um I I first say that I think Democrats for too long and focused only on the top of the ticket the federal level\nWithout remembering that are on a day to day basis people's lives will probably greater more impacted by what happens at the state and local level and so in terms of impacting people's lives that's why I think we should focus there but also as the chair of the national democratic redistricting committee\nOr um focus on the state and local level so that we can make sure that we have people at the table when redistricting is done in twenty Twenty one\nUh who are committed to fare redistricting and that is determined by who will be in the governor's races who will win the governor's races and who will ah when these um state legislative races\nOr talk about the significance of twenty Twenty one it has to do with the census\nWhile the census isn't twenty twenty and we want to make sure we have a fair census but after one year after the census occurs a redistricting occurs on twenty Twenty one\nAnd that is a process controlled by the state legislatures so how many state legislatures right now legislatures and governors mansions are controlled by Democrats [noise] um I don't know the exact number but the overall they're they're pretty substantial number that are controlled by\nRepublicans and our my hope is that in twenty Eighteen will start reversal of that trend continue it through twenty twenty so that when you get to twenty Twenty one you have Democrats at the table both at the gubernatorial level and at the state legislative level\nNow in in the twenty Eighteen elections you're targeting\nTwelve states I'm I'm not that includes Nineteen legislative chambers three ballot initiatives and six down ballot races those are very specific numbers can you talk about the the the significance of say the six down ballot races\nWhat we're trying to do is do we have done is to you ... did a fifty state analysis\nAnd in trying to determine how we can have the greatest impact on the redistricting process we identified twelve states and then um races with in those states\nThat are critical governors always matter um state legislative races matter a great deal um but when it comes to Ohio for instance the state auditor matters a great deal with regard to a fair redistricting to state secretary of state in Ohio\nI'm In certain states the Supreme Court matters more than it does in other places and that's why we\nSupport the candidate in was in a special election in Wisconsin with regard to a state Supreme Court seat where I'm supporting Anita Earls who's running for\nA state Supreme Court in North Carolina so we're really targeted focused on those races they will have the greatest impact and ensure a fair redistricting process come uh twenty Twenty one\nNow you mentioned the position of secretary of state and right now there's one secretary of state and protected or who's in the news and That's Brian Kemp secretary of state in Georgia who is also the Republican gubernatorial nominee\nFry he's the guy who is a player and a game and wants to be the umpire in the game at the same time\nAnd this is a fundamental front I think to our sense of a democracy and simple fairness he should resign as secretary of state he should resign he shouldn't simply recuse he should resign I mean uh in other races where\nAh in the past where secretaries of state have run for governor more often than not to secretary of state has recused himself\nOr herself a ... and what recourse is there if he if he doesn't resign and come election day they're irregularities or there are concerns about the vote in Georgia well you know a first I'd say that people have to go\nTo the polls and um [noise] irrespective of what the ... they might be saying in the newspapers or the the propaganda that they're trying to put out there people need to get to the polls demand a ballot go with the appropriate um ID and demand the ability to\nAlso lawsuits that are undoubtedly have been filed and I'm sure it will be filed to ensure again that a fair process a curse not only in Georgia but in other states are as well\nUm can efforts like at the ... those that are happening in Georgia\nThe voter intimidation aspect of it why isn't there a a greater outcry in terms of the um the knock on the the fairness of\nIt all well I think that you know there is a growing awareness of the unfairness of it all when you look at what's happened in North Dakota with regard to Native Americans or when you look at what's going on in Georgia with regard to those I guess fifty three thousand or so [noise] um registrations that are simply sitting on a Brian Kemp desk\nThere is a growing awareness among the American people that are electoral process is not being conducted in a fair way I'm Kris Kobach who's running for governor in Kansas has kind of lead the way here using his secretary of state position in that state\nThe national attention that he got when he was part of that ill fated\nAn electoral commission that a President Trump put together that collapse of because of its own weight a I think people are really focused on the fact that\nIn too many places are electric or elections are not being conducted in um in in a fair way with the California model be a better way to go do you think [noise]\nNot nonpartisan election yeah I actually think and I think the state is the view of the NPR see as well that the best way to do the redistricting process has to do it as they do it in Arizona and in California\nWhere you take it out of the hands of politicians altogether and you simply have these independent redistricting commission so I'm drawing the lines in too many places now we have a system where politicians are picking their voters instead of voters deciding who then representatives are going to be and that's why the\nNational democratic redistricting committee exactly supporting these ballot initiatives that would create a independent commissions in uh Michigan Missouri Colorado in Utah\nNow we were talking about Georgia before and I want to come back to Georgia because that I Would like for you to talk about\nThe comment heard around the world and that was when you said when they go low we kick 'em and you did say you didn't mean anything inappropriate or or illegal but it took on a life of its own instantly\nIt do your critics have a point or are they desperate\nBut it took on a life of its own because Republicans tried to make something of it more than it was it was a metaphor or and what I was essentially trying to say was that\nUm Democrats specifically the American people more generally need to be tough and fight against those people are those entities that would try to undermine our democracy or Republicans tried to make a great deal of\nThat remark in an attempt to put up a distraction so that people will focus on the fact that\nOf the ways in which they are trying to conduct these elections and unfair way so they don't focus on a tax cuts", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Madison", "day": "24"}
