I'm referring to to to that in ... surrounding that in the negotiations surrounding the new uh a U.S MCA deal I I Believe that this deal I Know for a fact this deal could have been done\nA long time ago I Know it could have been done with Canada having a bigger and better voice at the table I was concerned from the beginning that Mexico would go behind Canada's back and negotiate a deal and of course they did do that and then candidate was forced to the eleventh hour to move in and agree to terms that quite frankly that Mexico negotiated\nAnd so it was a bigger and better voice that you should have been at the table\nA and I thought good grief I mean why are people bringing this up now because I had a lot of things I agreed with him about and there were a lot of things we disagreed about\nBut it seems to me his opinions are utterly beside the point and irrelevant to the fact that he was a journalist who was murdered and\nWhat are some of the things that you have heard that you know that that teen found quite alarming that us media commentators have been saying this week\nWell one of the things that come up with the idea that he was an extremist or an Islamist and at some point people even say so sympathetic towards ...\nAnd uh I think that was really a terrible exaggeration he had some sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood there's no question about that that was something I disagreed with him about a quite a lot\nBut the idea that he was an extremist or that he was a a not a journalist but an activist or even more than an activist a conspiratorial ... conspirator\nIt was all I think a disturbing because I think a lot of it is quite inaccurate and very exaggerated I decided\nThat just basically to the Muslim Brotherhood charge because there there there's different there's varying degrees of radicalism within that organizes eight and ... where was he on the spectrum\nShe was some version of a fellow traveler in other words these are simply he saw them as\nA legitimate part of the Arab political scene and I think he was sympathetic to Muslim Brotherhood parties in the sense that I Would think he was basically one of these people and and there are lots of them who is basically a liberal but who sees the Brotherhood\nAs a core part of our democracy it thought my point of view but it's not a ... an illegitimate eccentric or extreme point of view it's a legitimate perspective\nAnd one of those things that started to float around and was retweeted by none other than Donald Trump junior was photo a mystic ... with Osama bin Laden that rattling around Afghanistan yes yes and he was somehow in El ... synthesized said what what's the story behind that\nWell that is that is a really great example of how disgusting this has become because\nAt no point in his life was ... and all kinds of sympathizer or a believer in violence or terrorism he did begin his career as many journalists young journalists um both Arabs and and Americans at a time did covering the war in Afghanistan\nAnd as a as a young Saudi journalist he was able to get in with this new breed of people who at the time we called Arab Afghans or or you know sort of our part of the ...\nAh and then eventually some of them more students who becoming a hide the fact that he was covering that partly makes\nHim a sympathizer and the great irony of course is that these people got going and they were in Afghanistan and doing what they were doing because the United states was encouraging them to do it any arms that they had came from the United states and but it was always essentially involved in an American covert war\nSo what's behind this you can eat you raise the question why several times why is because there are people who knows that the background to this short distance to discredit sets\nWhole point here and it's really disgusting used to try to mitigate the sense of outrage about what's happened to an end to kind of say in every round about way\nThat this isn't all that bad because he was either not a journalist but an activist or even a spirit or and he was not a liberal he was an Islamist or even an extremist and the terrorists or something you know ... those are the kind of progression of absurdity that you get\nAnd anywhere you go in this direction I think he's going tended to make people feel\nLess alarmed less horrified less angry and to recast this as less of an outrage you know this is not the time and moment to have a debate about ... complex political opinions and that would have been before he was killed or a long time after the cases resolved\nRight now the only thing we can be gained by is frankly\nIs to try to imply that it's not that big a deal and I find that horrible\nI Wonder who who the target is because the same time we had seen a Donald Trump said that journalists at the enemy the people he praised politician for having assaulted a journalist so obviously there's no love lost their so who who's the intended target for this\nI think the intended audience is people on the right of the American spectrum or others who are trying to think very badly about the Muslim Brotherhood may be supportive of Israel people on the Christian right intense secularists which you can put me in that last count but still\nThe point is that I think that there's an idea that show him out because she is being misrepresented being cast as a better person than he was which is ridiculous but I think that's the idea and that people who can really learn what he actually thought\nWe'll think again about how bad this was that if\nYou really infuriating and they're not all lives like any good conspiratorial urban legend there's a grain of truth in parts of it but uh I think the only thing that can be gained right now by getting into it is to make people care less about the fact\nThat he's gone missing and probably dead\nDoes this indicate though that how much they are worried about this story and about the the impact there's a lot of people worried about how big an impact is this are and I and I would imagine\nThat they don't want the United states to overreact and certainly there are pro Israel voices who do not want the United states to become to a strange from Saudi Arabia I Want to keep the heat on Iran\nAnd want to make sure that this doesn't mess that up and I actually think that's a very important project but I I think that the ... are two different matters you know nothing should justify people's sense of outrage about loose a heinous atrocities\nWe let me that there will be following this dynasty and they think\nYou're very welcome Hussein Amish has known Jamal ... D for more than Fifteen Years he works at the Arab Gulf states Institute is a senior resident scholar we reached Mr Bush in Washington DC\n\nAnd and [noise] and [noise]\n[noise] and\nIn Somerville Maine there was a small family business that sells earrings cuckoo clocks and Christmas decorations it is run by Mary wind batch and lately she and her business which is called ... have been getting a lot\nThen she was able to quit her day job and dedicated her time to her passion making crafts out of ... [noise] we reached means when back in Somerville and due to the subject matter listeners may find some of the language of fence of Mary what are you doing\nThat you moved to today\nWell today I'm assembling my turns because tonight at seven o'clock I got to stand up comedy act\n[laughter] we've\nGot we've got wicked orders for the poo poo clocks and so we've got people all over the place assembling church for us you know and help them get us getting them ready I'm Talking over four hundred clocks\nAll right let's just take this just a lot of things I Want to unpack your winters poo poo clocks\nWhile the poodle clock instead of a coup go it's a ... o'clock and we put the church in between the numbers show it reads one turned eight to thirty three charity and we're working on corporate in the machine so and that's ... got it all\n[laughter] All right so that's and that's a hot item right now that's like ... they're just they're flying off the shelves\nAbsolutely yeah okay what else have you got there\nWell we've got fecal people and depending upon the shape of the middle towards right there we can do with big moves and guts and bought some long legs in Salt Lake City because no two thirds are like\nUm yeah we got that and then another another big item we have is the Dingell berries see we get the angle berries bells and we've got all the balls we've got ... got the ... and those are good for putting on the Christmas tree course you can never have enough crap hanging off the tree or\nYou put it on the review me already a vehicle seeing you take a corner and you've got that turned justice slinging all around the place\nNot only is it a conversation page but I wanted to get out of a fifty dollar parking ticket with a five dollar uttered I actually have the cops and they let me go and that's a true story\n[laughter] where where did you give the cop\nI gave him a third I didn't go with the law the cop slump and blue balls\n[laughter] okay now where's you get the idea to turn to into gold\nOh I saw the church one day you know walking in the woods and because of all we see them but I got to thinking one day when that me funny that instead of eyeballs on it you know and you could call it like a little had thing so we did that\nAnd then there's the product line has just been expanding in expanding and developing new products and stuff and we'll sit around at night and drink a beer or something is that coming up with some stupid ... surgeon it's just funny so we just keep going with it you know\nI understand you got your latest is Forrest Gump\nYes Forrest Gump and we're going to put the ... they live a shrimp you don't want a couple of little faint trees\nAll right so and speaking of forest this is where you collect your materials in the woods right\nCorrect no getting probably within a mile and a half two miles from the house he usually will get a hundred to a hundred and fifty pounds of turns Everytime we go out in the woods\nThis means that they must image if you stop attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure including schools hospitals and water systems which I saw a trend show for the Yemeni population as well as you have any children nothing really justifies killing innocent children\nAnd depriving them off their basic rights\nThere's a couple of things that people are saying that immediately have to happen which is number one has to be that the airstrikes by the coalition I have to end the cat the any more interesting would you agree with that\n[noise] oh we would like to really call on all are you still have the conflict to make sure that is a situation where children can be safe at home or at school or in public places\nBut ... you know we we've been covering this story for more than three years almost four years now and each time we revisit the ... the people like yourself\nIt's worse and the world knows that they the international conferences know that the word is out the pictures as these children at it are are freely available so what does it take\nTo actually get to the political will the international political will to end this war what would it take\nVery right I have spent more than two years in Yemen and I've only seen the situation get was with every passing day and it is sad that that is so much suffering happening and the world is studying a blind eye the parties to the conflict must work\nTo reach an image of political solution [noise]\nAnd all those who have influence on the ... to the conflict must do their best to make sure that the suffering of children in Yemen ... will stop soon\nWhy do you think the world doesn't moved and what is now the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world\nIt is really high time that the global community pays attention to this crisis it is important to also understand that the impacts of this crisis when you go long into the future as of this will affect\nFuture generations what is happening to children in Yemen today as many of them lose their lives as many of them are deprived of their basic rights\nSo it does heightened time that the word notices this crisis and pays attention and it shows that ... to the conflict reach a negotiated political solution\nThat directly I Know you have lots of work there as a doctor so I'm going to leave it and I appreciate speaking with you tonight\n... by Dr ... the deputy representative of UNICEF in Yemen we reached him in Santa\n[noise]\n\n\n... where\nIn twenty sixteen New Hampshire congressional candidate Jonah Ryan released the following campaign ad in which she's wearing an outdoors he'd get up in a rustic setting and swinging an ax\nPresident Selina Meyer thinks she can show up our prosperity [noise]\nThe president is but in general and I approved\nIt is a powerful visual metaphor even if it seems like he's just chopping the same log over and over again and even if one late edit shows Mr Ryan missing blog entirely [noise]\nIt is so powerful in fact that now a different candidate has just made a strikingly similar ad here's Joe Donnelly democratic senator from Indiana explaining why his Republican opponent Mike Braun is bad\nWhile wearing an outdoors you get up in a rustic setting and swinging an ax\nFor the most part I'm an easygoing guy but not when my brother keeps lying about my wrestling\nFlew in my own party [noise]\nJust for funding for ...\nThe liberal left one since ... no way I'm not into a fair fight about giving our troops in\nI've voted to extend the Bush tax cuts\nHis shift jobs to China [noise]\nWe've got to cut that out I'm Joe Donnelly approve this message\nSo two very similar political ads the thing is one of them is not real the first one the one made two years ago to promote the campaign of Jonah Ryan a character on veep\nThe HBO sitcom that brutally and squarely satirized says the banality and pity of American politics\nJonah Ryan is not real he is a beep character\nWho is pretty much universally despised he has been referred to as an unstable peace of humans scaffolding a useless waste of carbon sheep sasquatch and a ... and ... among literally hundreds of other insults none of which I can say on the radio\nSo put aside the fact that senator Donnelly openly claims he's quote not into a fair fight and that all his acts jokes are really not quite as cutting as he seems to think because the fact is by mimicking a parody deliberately or otherwise he risks\nBecoming one someone trying to establish he is a man of character he has the settlers instead that he is a man of caricature\nIf he was still

a stamp laid out any way you could\nTake us back to the sixties in Vancouver and when a hippie culture was strong when when marijuana was on the scene what was it like then\nYou know one time everybody was short hair and she just weirdos had long hair but overnight marijuana in LSD got introduced\nEverything changed except the cops and the cops were still back in the fifties it was that

... was part of that whole set up you know you always trying to bust us\nHe has now died and he has died at just about a year before the Canadian government plans to make marijuana legal in this country what do you think he would have made of that\nI imagine he would have said uh you know whatever my entire life in Ames entire life has always been illegal are going to one side of the it was on the other side and I really respect to them 'cause he was true to craft it was mark and Mark's\nTommy Chong Vancouver native of Cheech and Chong fame speaking with guest host Rosemary Martin in
