T. L.\nNow to today's news and again we begin with the status of the Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court last late last night the Senate received the FBI report on its investigation into the sexual assault allegations made by Dr Christine lousy for\nThe Senate plans to vote to end debate tomorrow and then hope to vote to confirm this weekend\nToday reaction to the FBI report was just about what you'd expect with Democrats dismissing the report as incomplete and Republicans saying they're fully satisfied that there is no evidence that judge Kavanaugh assaulted Dr Ford when they were in high school\nEarlier today I spoke with Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy who just come off the Senate floor\nSenator Chris Murphy welcome to America on the line there is a correct me if I'm wrong you announced in July that you would be voting against a judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination right\nIf I did I was one of the first out of the gate I'm unapologetic about that I saw this train coming did some study about cabinet once he became one of the final two or three choices and came to the conclusion that he was just way out of step with where my constituents were in Connecticut and so I now to my opposition to him early\nRight and today you took to the Senate floor to speak out a again against him what did you say\n[noise] so I said today that I had come to a slightly different conclusion I now believe that he is the most dangerous nominate that\nHas been before the Senate in my lifetime and and that conclusion was one I reached shortly after his testimony oh there's so many things to\nWorry about in that testimony obviously at the top of the list of the very real likelihood that the things to a doctor for it that she alleges but his sort of naked partisanship his threats to Democrats his belief that this is some\nClinton connected conspiracy that's been run against him up to me is the most damning a part of this whole episode and and what I was trying to warn my colleagues is it this is a Pandora's box that is hard to close [laughter]\nOnce you start putting naked partisans on the court [noise] um you start to undermine the belief that Americans still clinging to that there are at least nine people in this country who are above the partisan fights that we have and I get that folks out that all the time I'm given some of the decisions that the Supreme Court under takes but\nWe do you know not since the days when we used to regularly put former senators governors on the court or have we been faced with an individual who showed his stripes his political and personal traits so clearly\nWorries me were you surprised by that I mean I just as as a citizen sitting and watching I'm gassed at at the naked partisanship were you as a sitting senator surprised\n[noise] um yes I mean I guess I feel like I'm not surprised by much here anymore but\nUh as I was sort of following his remarks man I thought maybe he was going to end by withdrawing because I couldn't figure how somebody thought that they weren't going to get Republican votes by attacking Democrats so mercilessly and\nMaking these wild claims about how this attack was coordinated so I thought that he was giving a withdrawal speech um but in fact he wasn't he was doubling down and you know we're a couple of hours before the vote now yet to see if\nHe succeeded but I guess he felt pretty desperate following um what was really compelling\nTestimony from Christine forward\nLet me bring you to your your remarks in the Senate floor specific in March when the Senate floor today you huge of a connection between having a a and his stance on the Affordable CARE Act abortion and guns can you talk briefly about each of those areas of so\nHe was and I I just think this this this guy's a radical on many of those issues you know his his opinion\nDenying an abortion to young immigrant girl who qualified for that procedure under all existing legal requirements the way that he sort of adopts the language of the anti choice movement using words like abortion inducing drugs and\nAbortion on demand you know that that all tells you that you know anybody who thinks he's not going to overturn roe versus Wade is just living in a fantasy world he's going to do it and he's going to do it as quickly as he can I'm On the Affordable CARE Act I just take Trump at his word that he has\nMade this decision not to appoint anybody who isn't going to help him dismantle the law I think that's what Kavanaugh will do\nI guess maybe most worried about him on the second amendment because I spent so much time\nThinking I'm working on guns he really is more radical and guns and he is on anything else he is likely you know what we sort of call a Second Amendment originalist somebody who doesn't think that Congress can impose any restrictions that weren't contemplated in the text of the original amendment itself and um he he exposed to\nThat that radical nature on on the second amendment to the committee and and and that sort of where the the sort of judicial rate is moving a to go way beyond the Heller decision which says yeah you ... there's a right to individual gun ownership but you can restrict that right within you know the twenties\nHe probably doesn't believe there's any ability to restrict that right and maybe he'll be able to convince a few other justices to move with him\nLet's talk about the current chaos if you will that's now engulfing a judge Kavanaugh's nomination and that is the uh FBI report yesterday\nYou tweeted quote one copy of the FBI report no more than an hour to review it no ability for any follow up than a rush to vote\nFor two years McConnell that senator Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell McConnell has been carefully and purposely breaking the Senate this is the final blow do comedy or tradition left it's just about power politics\n[noise] yeah I I I ... when I'm angry taxes and that was clearly a pretty pissed last night when I sent that out um but I still believe it I mean\nWhether it's you know getting rid of a filibuster for Supreme Court justices ending the practice of what we call blue slips for appellate court nominees to the the the rights of home state senators to objects people pumping\nSupport for WPRI comes from all through a federal credit union offering a home

humiliating things I've ever been a part of their work you know must have been Fifteen Democrats\nIn this room sharing this report with only an hour and only an hour because Republicans were coming in at the end of the our way to clear out of the room we're desperately trading papers trying to read as much of it as we\nCan literally ... I'm Sorry literally one copy what all of you to share\nOne copy for all of us to share so we broke it up and tried to read it in pieces but you know it's like it's like a Keystone cop movie you're trying to remember which page that I read which page do you have way can I have your page\nUm all the while the staff who has read it and digested it I'm trying to I'm trying to explain the parts that you haven't gotten to yet I I Can't explain the chaos of what's happening inside that briefing room\nThere is no way that any senator Republican or Democrat has thoroughly red understood and digested\nThat report and that being said but one thing that you do understand about that report when you read it\nIs it the FBI was deliberately told not to go certain places not to interview certain people but there are big questions that you can tell they couldn't ask and so with the story really is what's missing in that FBI report not what's in it what\nDoes this do than ... assuming judge Kavanaugh is confirmed let's say he does get confirmed what does this do to the standing of the Supreme Court and particularly his standing as a justice on the court if he is indeed confirmed\nUnder ... ... under these circumstances\n[noise] I I just think you have to put yourself in the in the position of a of a petition or who's you know comes out of the sort of progressive liberal side of the\nAnd when we come back from the break we're going to bring in our political panel to actually respond to what they've\nHeard you're listening to America on the line [noise]\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday\n\n[noise] Hi I'm Jeff Gordon this week on ...

Trump supporter but man there's a lot of polling suggesting that that at least for the moment\nThat there may be a cabin all bump in states like Montana Indiana West Virginia and Missouri and Tennessee among Republicans and conservatives were angry at what they see is the is the attempt to tear down a judge Kavanaugh but I think it's it's going to be interesting will that anger\nContinue if in fact he's approved because usually you know the the losing side is the more angry and anger is the rocket fuel loves of political motive re enter\nEntirely you know this brings up a talked about conspiracy theories of of mind but it gets to your point of a winning by losing and ... I Would love to hear your thoughts on this as well wouldn't Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell win\nBy losing the nomination or in the in the floor vote a judge Kavanaugh\nBecause if the Kavanaugh nomination goes down to defeat to Charlie's points that in rages and soaks up the Republican Party base that could be helpful to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell remaining majority leader or am I\n... I don't think you're nuts but I think that there are a lot of Republicans and Mitch McConnell may even be one of them\nWho would rather get U.S Supreme Court nominee through um even at the cost of possibly making a marginally negative difference in some Senate races I mean there are a lot of Republicans for whom\nGetting conservative Supreme Court justice there was a big part of what they are there for the other thing though is we don't actually have a lot of experience about a charged battle over Supreme Court nomination right before a midterm election I mean if you think about it\nThe big fight over Clarence Thomas I'm happened a year before the next election um and it's not even you know I mean there's been a lot of toxins that end at the time about the\nYear the one but it's actually not clear that made a huge difference in that election um I mean we did get Senator Patty\nMurray Senator Dianne Feinstein as a result of\nThat and they were going with it but it was the one the one ways where in that year that I think you can make a strong case that it made a difference was Carol Moseley Braun winning the Democratic primary over Allen diction in Illinois Dixon having having been for Thomas\nBut for the rest of it you know would largely an economy election it was not an election where in the fall of Nineteen Ninety two there was actually a lot of talk about the uh the hill and Thomas\nI'm controversy so I think I'm not saying this won't make a huge difference in turn around I'm just saying we don't know we actually we don't have a lot of data on the question of you know so let's say cabinet gets confirmed it I guess the conventional wisdom right now\nDoes the conservative anger some side or can last for another month you know we just you know not just an open question\nAs a Christian I'm Susan Glasser sends out a tweet today and said basically\nGo accept everyone everywhere is angrier and here's what it sounded like as protesters swarmed the Senate Hart office building today [noise]\nI mean those those are protesters um their partying and they're cheering but they're also angry if Kavanaugh to give the flip side if Kavanaugh is confirmed um does that anger like can that anger be even more inflamed\nOr were Democrats definitely you know but there's there's some ... there so I definitely think the Democrats will be motivated because what many Democrats are witnessing is essentially the fraying of American democracy and the three branches of government you have\nA hyper partisan Supreme Court nominee who traffics in conspiracy theories who's being pushed through by a Republican Senate that has changed the rules to make sure that he gets in and the Democrats have not forgotten about Merrick Garland butter you know\nThat was never in the greatest hits of democratic rights but now it is because they realize that the process\nRight not just the individual but the process is so skewed and then you have an executive who also trap fixing conspiracy theories and his hyper I mean he claims to be hyper partisan but he has a very distinct world view that is exclusive an isolationist which is very worrisome to Democrats so\nAll that being said we also have to remember though\nWe're pretending like we've resolved as Russia issue\nIs not that Russia has left us alone so I think a lot of Democrats are concerned that there could still be voter\nFraud and voter tampering not from anyone you know in in our nation necessarily but from outside forces and also the ways in which Republican state houses as ... you mentioned\nAh when you when you when you lose right by her by one but he lost so many state houses across the country and so we had these Republican controlled state houses and governorship that have gerrymandered Democrats out of\nSort of a fair districts in process\nSo as much as Democrats may try to win and they have qualified candidates and they're raising money and it's women in people's color and the women of color really do a lot of great things that the deck is in many ways stacked against Democrats\nRunning in many places across the country so it's always turnout turnout turnout but I think Democrats will definitely be motivated because they're seeing that this nomination is the combination of what seems to be an illegitimate matches presidency but Congress and now a Supreme Court as well\nAnd we're going to have to leave it there on that point thank you Charlie Crist the ... when we come back a record number of teachers across America are running for office this year we're going to talk to some of them to find out why you're listening to America on the line [noise]\n\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from
