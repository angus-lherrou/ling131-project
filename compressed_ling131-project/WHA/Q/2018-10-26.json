Brian in Minnesota Bloomberg News is reporting that Minnesota is looking more and more like a bellwether for the country particularly in the house races or talk about that\nYeah there are eight congressional districts in Minnesota and four of them are considered true battlegrounds there's a couple that are in open seats were democratic incumbents are leaving those are areas that Donald Trump won two years ago\nAnd one of them is leaving to run for governor the other one just stepped aside to run for lieutenant governor a different ticket didn't make it through Republicans have a really strong shot at capturing this seat in northern Minnesota where\nDonald Trump has been you know as far as working class messages really resonated in southern Minnesota the trade tariffs are causing some uh\nTrouble for his party because the ... it's very farm heavy so the Democrats are trying to hold on to that and they might have a shot at that and then there are two suburban seats where Donald Trump is is a focal point a lot of suburban women are cool to Donald Trump\nDonald Trump actually endorsed one of the Republican incumbents this week in that race\nThat incumbent hadn't been trying to keep a distance from the president's so there's some question as to whether that will really help him or if it will be more of an anchor around his neck or the Democrats who are running in these races are they making Donald Trump a focal point are they trying to do with Andrew Janz is doing in California and talk about a issues\nThe two Republicans running in these open seats in in kind of more rural areas they're given a big bear hug did the president they both appeared within the president came to town and both of their district the\nPresident's ah ... the political action committee that's associated with the president is spending a lot of money they just put a million dollars in for the last two weeks in one of the congressional races\nAnd in the suburbs there there there's one candidate who's who's appeared on stage with Trump in and said that I I fully support all the actions that the president's taken and then the other one Paulson who is kind of more of a moderate Republican who is like I said tried to keep his distance from the president\nAnd he he's running behind right now ... that's going to end Helen Peterson in Montana welcome back to this to the show and\nPresident Trump or he's been to Minnesota a lot in North Dakota are a lot but he's been to Montana a lot ah he's throwing his full weight behind Republican state auditor Matt Rosendale who's running against the incumbent Senator Jon tester why as Montana such a huge priority for the Republican Party\n[noise] well yeah you know like you said he's been here three times since the first time he came was July ... and I think you know I honestly think that a lot of it has to do with the fact that tester and his role and with the\nWith veterans services the Veterans' Affairs committee and was one of the\n... the list of complaints against ah the president's doctor who he had nominated to\nI served as head of the VA on those complaints were not investigated or or confirm necessarily fights and the doctor did you resent his his application the next day and Trump just sees that as an enormous affront he said afterwards that he thought that test or should resign\nAnd I think he also just doesn't understand how he could win big in Montana you know he won by nearly twenty percent and yet the state elect Democrats like tester and our governor who won the same year that\nSupport for WPRI comes from Nordic a consulting firm dedicated to helping health care organizations drive the best performance from their people and technology more information and career opportunities are at Nordic W.

I think that there's been a combination of ... of cable news in general sort of feeding the spectacle and\nOver the last twenty plus years there's there has been just objectively a right wing um media empire has has made it easier for people to believe things that aren't true so I think that the media has been part of a\nDivided ecosystem on national politics are but I'm not echoing it'll what Donald Trump says in in making that\nPoint mhm well is is any of this a fixable either in the near term or ever\nUm yes it I think [laughter] as another former president said it depends what the meaning of this year [laughter] so so if we're talking about um\nThe argument that that my wife to I've been I've been making over the last four or five years in the Atlantic in the in our book is essentially that that and just the moment\nWhen national politics really is bitter and really is dysfunctional and really is polarizing you do have the other parts of American Life\nAlmost in reaction finding ways to reach constitute their civic fabric and the last five or six months we've been to sort of an open ended book tour in\nRed state America mainly where people say yes rental show you Little Rock Arkansas let a show you Bellingham, Washington let us show you Pensacola, Florida let a show you Muncie, Indiana these places where\nPeople can find a way to stop arguing about the sort of fratricide national politics and experiment with their schools and experiment with um with uh with all sorts of things can I tell you a story about dodge city we have time for\nUs so it goes I I I was going to get to dodge city um after asking you about asking you about your book which is called our towns a hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of America in which\nYou you did this a hundred thousand mile journey and despite the ... the seeming freak out that is happening around the country particularly if you're looking at at cable news you came away from that trip and even in your comments in this interview right now optimistic\nAbout about the country and I do ... explain why and and incorporate dodge city into your hands yes\nSo first I'll have a definition of optimism that I came across recently met probably many people do but it was new to me a ... one poll rumor won the Nobel Prize in economics a week or two ago somebody I've known him like he he just said ...\nWhat he called complacent optimism which was the belief that things will get better\nFrom what he called conditional optimism\nWhich was the belief that they could get better and that they could get better if you try and if you get engaged in if you're involved et cetera you know for me complacent optimism is that next week I'll be a good shape hashed often is that six months from now I could be a good shape if I did all sorts of and so I think it is conditional optimism\nIn the face of genuine uh not not\nJust spare a genuine darkness of the national level where\nWe're known winning meaning to express and I'll give you the dodge city except I think most of your listeners saw the story last day or two of the polling place in dodge city famous from the gun smoke westerns now a majority Latino town the polling place being moved away out of town\nTo ... up you know apparently just to depressed turn out by the ... Latino electorate there and darts dodge city um when we were in dodge city uh two two years ago at at some great lengths\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to America on the line from WNYC as it happens returns in its entirety on friday November second\nAnd next time I asked me another Ethan Slater star of Bob square pants the Broadway musical tells us about the call that led to it all and they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically the entitled to no end up project but we think you might be the right shape for it [laughter]\nJoined me off your eyes and very NPR our puzzle games and trivia\nSaturday morning at ten on the ideas network\nSupport for WPRI comes from the ... foundation presenting crane congregations the spectacle of thousands of cranes gathered along the Wisconsin River before migration\nAlgal Leopold dot org slash WPRI WPRI connects you to the people in Wisconsin and around the world you hear many perspectives and civil conversations every day and you may even learn a few things along the way Wisconsin Public radio brings you thoughtful conversations and the latest news thanks for listening\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I ... I like that I liked that description of your of your generation I'm going to steal it [laughter]\nMatt thank you very much for calling into America on the line I bring the panel bet my panel back and Brian where hosta WNYC use the Brian Lehrer show and buzzfeed correspondent and Helen Peterson who's calling us in\nMissoula, Montana uh Brian\nWhen or want you to bring us up to speed on the uh the the pipe bombs and what's happening here in New York City and how local leaders are handling the situation and how residents are doing\nFirst of all math for president that last caller yes maybe he's the one who bring everybody together with Mali as vice president that's right and and Helen Peterson I was reading an article about\nThe Democrat book out in Montana and you know you wrote about people who voted for Trump for president and Democrat bullet for governor and just thought Hillary Clinton didn't listen to them or care about them so\nUn dollar questions can Democrats appeal to white swing voters instill legitimately represent the base of people of color progressive white women in the party um and you know maybe we just heard from the caller from New Jersey that at least the ... ten show\nIs out there there's some hunger out there but then they still have to legitimately represent 'em now as far as the devices for me as a journalist I don't want to get ahead of the facts and I think again a lot of the sensationalizing media are getting ahead of the fact we don't know who did it\nWe don't know the motive actual rate winters fake right wing terrorists on meet the press Chuck Todd wondered if maybe if someone working for Russia\nRussia trying again to show divisions in American society he wasn't positive that he was just throwing up his hands and saying we don't know maybe this is just the mentally ill persons expression of their disease and soon there will be answers but we don't have them you\nKnow listening to New York city officials that their news conference today\nThey wouldn't even confirm if the devices were actual explosives that could actually explode or look alike devices just intended to cause fear that would still be terrorism right intend to cause terror for political reasons but we don't know if these were actually attempted assassination or big grotesque\nPublicity stuff I'm\nAs a New Yorker and a New Yorker who was here on nine eleven and two thousand one we go on with our lives that's been the message from the mayor of New York and the governor of New York\nWe're not going to be intimidated by this assuming these are real devices were going to go on with our lives and law enforcement is going to do their job um to figure out what's going on here and I think that's where we are\nIn ... and Helen I'm going to take a a a hard turn here because I Want to have you talk about that the voter suppression efforts that are affecting Native Americans in Montana and you know a lot of people are focused on those efforts in North Dakota but what's going on in Montana [noise] well\nYou know in Montana I think a lot of the issues that they're saying that are present on rural reservations across the United states and that\nIt's hard to get your an absentee ballot because you know many people share post off post office box is because there's not enough you know you can have up to like ten twenty people sharing a post office box and but then also just driving distance and that sort of thing\nAnd one thing that I've seen him and I have a big story coming out on this and this weekend\nIs on the reservation and then add a whole reservation town and your tie you know it's not just the distance that you have to drive it's not just the fact that the vast majority of citizens are currently miss located precinct rise because\nYou know there there were placed decades ago\nBefore their GPS coordinates so like the registration is ten miles north of the chapter house that sort of thing but it's also the fact that you I on the Navajo reservation there is a huge number of people who don't speak English and in how", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Madison", "day": "26"}
