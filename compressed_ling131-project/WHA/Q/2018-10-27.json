around the world ... created and designed really he lives in West grove Pennsylvania but today we reached Mr ... in the villages Florida\n[noise] Mr Raymond what was it like to hear a city council pay tribute to gritty\nWell I'll tell you it's um this whole thing has been somewhat of a surprise when it reached they a different level of decibel if you will in terms of\nThe acknowledgement and the acceptance because going in certainly uh we were preparing for it to not be accepted in any way shape or form in in terms of critters roll out and did not only that it did come in negative very early in the short\nTwenty four hours at a completely reversed and now suddenly a gritty is a phenomenon and it's it's not something that anybody myself for the flyers explains expected\nWhy were you expecting such a negative reaction well have you ever been to Philadelphia [laughter] huge [laughter] I'm not sure who you're insulting when that's why I'm going to take a I'm going to take a pedal back [laughter]\nAre fans are are very very discriminating in terms that great knowledge about each sport\nUm and they don't like any fooling around you know they want to get to it they want to win so they when you throw some marketing it to them they sense that this is some you know the way to get people to love the flyers um they're against it in Philadelphia it's been tough fans they do not like you know the furry creatures however\nThe fanatic [noise] a kind of slipped under the radar back in Nineteen Seventy eight has become one of the basketball mascot sports\nThis is the Philly fanatic um for the for the Phillies baseball team\nCorrect and and he's probably recognized as one of the best mascots and all sports [noise] um and you know I was a performer for an article in Nineteen Seventy eight so\nThey were frightened too but I can that day you could come out and that they just let the ... come out one night didn't say anything about him and he got a lot of positive response but today's world\nMake an announcement that this was going to get the flyers new mascot an organization can never really liked mascots and we're clear that they weren't going to have a mascot\nFor its part the Milwaukee school district says it has this year embark on a new plan that focuses on teaching at grade level that helping students who've fallen behind by focusing on the needs of individual students\nFor example to students who made the eighth grade level and there may be an achievement gap where the students may be functioning at a sixth grade level our plan is that you know what our focus is\nOur teachers are going to teach at the eighth grade level and then they're going to begin to differentiate in scaffold from there to get out students where they need to be\nDr Jeremiah Holliday says the district with a laser in on reading writing and math\nAnd has freed up a ... million dollars from the administration office to go directly to the classrooms are educators to researchers at a politician ... the mission is clear narrow Senate race the gap it's\nOn us like we have to work together to get this thought the consequences are really severe without\nConsequences like achievement gaps in higher education skills gaps and generational poverty so again Laura Lynch on this issue is something that they used to quote education uh governors are going at each other over\nYeah and and I mean in the context of this campaign the reason is because you have Tony Evers who brings to this uh this race is resume running the state's education system it Scott Walker has been bringing us up or brought it up initially in an effort to try to undercut Uber's resume their\n... and yet on the ... budget um does talk about things to do towards this ship\nIt does so she talked about on a number of issues specifically in his budget has budgeted a large increase in spending and one of the places that he is increasing most markedly is for mental health care for students and this is something that\nPeople have really focused on in terms of you know tightening that achievement gap has really provided mental health services and things like a trauma informed care and and trauma and\nForm care is also something that the governor is looking closely at because of course ah\nHis wife the first lady is very involved in those efforts absolutely that sort of her the issue so we've seen a lot of talk about that\nAnd this is all been part of the greater school funding debate is part of this race let's hear what the candidates have to say about paying for schools while keeping taxes in check [noise]\nDog Walker is first first budget cuts hundreds of millions of dollars all over our case we're told system and we have never recovered from that and so we have extraordinary size you're about to cross the state and frankly people Wisconsin or\nUh is this law tax guy but over a hundred or a million people in the state of Wisconsin voted to increase taxes on themselves for the public schools because the state of doing their fair share\nTommy Thompson showed us years ago you can find two thirds instill lower the property tax burden on the hardworking people the state we did it last budget with historic actual do investments in the schools store and property taxes are going to do it again going forward\nI support both of my kids man Alex are here they both want the public schools and what to ... my nieces are going public schools today I Want every child to have access to a great education but I also want to make sure particularly for our seniors that we don't see the kind of property tax increases a twenty seven percent in the decades before we took office\nSo schools in Texas so what's new here is it Scott Walker is saying that the state will get back to funding two thirds of for education or what does that mean\nYeah that's ah you hear that thrown out alive two thirds being the state would pick up two thirds of the cost of public education Wisconsin local property taxpayers pick up the rest basically\nThis is something that was a benchmark established under Tommy Thompson went away in law under governor Jim Doyle although ... tried to get it as a goal on a couple of budget it's\nA it's not something that Walker is hit in his tenure but he says now that he wants to hit that in his next budget if he's reelected and it's something also that Tony ... has said he even\nSaid it consistently yeah going back to earlier in this campaign and and try to stand your state superintendent so he's had a goal for a while for Scott Walker a it's been relatively recent\nNow the other thing that Tony Evers was hang just there was that people have voted to raise taxes on themselves to find their schools and what he's talking about this kind of referenda in local I'm voting districts where people say no we need more money to do this or that for their schools\nThat's right and that's something that ... versus talk it out a lot actually who mentioned it in his state of the state address last year\nAnd he calls these ad Scott Walker taxes things like raising the referendum for school sending he's also talked about on roads spending on so he says the governor claims to be a low taxes guy but sort of inadvertently people are paying more for these things and that they're willing to pay more for education actually\nBut in terms of uh the education governor mantle or Tony Evers budget has requested budget going forward or when he would increase the amount of funding going toward a K. twelve\nThat's right it would be a pretty substantial increase actually he a proposed a one point four billion dollar\nBudget on in his budget proposal for this year the governor hasn't released his official proposal yet that something he would do in January if he's reelected so we can't make an apples to apples comparison but comparing it to the budget we had in place right now it's a pretty big increase okay\nFrom schools to jobs will switch gears now here from the candidates on their plans to go Wisconsin's economy\nWe've got big things is part of our plan to keep Wisconsin working for generations to come\nLike helping working families many of home when they first have children find it challenging to get back into the workforce so we're providing a childcare tax credits to make it a little bit easier to afford childcare if their spouse wants to get back into the workforce we're doing more things for people seeking public assistance to get them employ ability trend again for those\nWho might potentially be suffering from addiction and get them the healthcare\nAnd the rehabilitation idea to get back up on their feet again we can find a job for everyone in the state but it doesn't happen you're going to raise taxes like Tony ... talking about\nFirst of all we need to make sure that we invest and Scott for companies that said is absolutely critical clearly a Foxconn issue is going to have higher profile issue in state and I I'm sure every one of them are ah viewers to go to er washers program\nScott Walker did for Fox got we have to stop a Hail Mary pass as we have to invest in those young start ups that are that are real important in the state that not only keeps them in the state but it also gives other young people hope to the ... the state can play a positive role in helping them\nBecome productive workers in that part of Wisconsin society instead of moving all state\nWell until it comes to mind about jobs and the economy is that Wisconsin's economy right now is humming along unemployment and about three percent and so it makes you wonder how this race is so tight at this point with the economy which is usually a major issue that the number one issue is so good\nIt's just a reminder that um you know you you just don't know whatever elections going to be about going into it and any governor would love to run with a three percent unemployment rate or thereabouts of but this is by all indications a close race and or is it seemed like there may be other things at play in this one\nThat Tony ... as we just saw a reference Foxconn um but you were noting that that didn't come up and their first debate\nNot one mention of of Foxconn in that debate for all the talk that we've given it seemed like the biggest thing maybe that happened certainly in the last few years of the governors administration and it didn't come up in that way and you haven't seen it in a big way in the ad war either between Tony ... and Scott Walker was so what do we\nMake of that well I think what we make of that is neither party thinks that it's going to be a good issue for them necessarily it's not something that's going to benefit them if they bring it out it's kind of a tricky issue\nA Walker has run positive ads about Foxconn especially early on in there a saying that it had a statewide impact and things like that but and it's certainly something that there are pros and cons on in the states pretty divided I think that when a friend that yeah risky\nSo I so how do we think Walker's former CEO of Wisconsin economic development or a corporation coming out opposed to hand place in these final days\nI don't know I mean it does because he's the fourth cabinet secretary former Walker Kevin effect trade was criticized the governor it does create a\n... for Democrats that's a good narrative or people who worked for Scott Walker don't like him three those Kevin secretaries have said that they oppose the governor in this election they'll support Tony Evers Walker said hey it shows that I have a diversity of opinions within my cabinet and he's OK with that\nSo I guess we have to leave that issued their cells from jobs to health care specifically what the candidates are saying about providing insurance coverage to those with preexisting conditions\nWe can protect people with preexisting conditions in the state without protecting the failure that as Obamacare look my wife who's here tonight is a type ... diabetic my mom who's sitting right next to her as a cancer survivor my brother has a heart condition\nOr like a lot of you at home watching and when we talk about covering preexisting conditions for families it's very personal in Wisconsin everyone living with preexisting conditions discovered right now and as long as I'm governor it will always be covered in the state of Wisconsin\nI mean we have the governor's saying oh my gosh I'm I'm concerned about making sure the pre existing conditions are going prevent people from getting good health care and that's important to me I'm a cancer survivor so I get that issue", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "27"}
