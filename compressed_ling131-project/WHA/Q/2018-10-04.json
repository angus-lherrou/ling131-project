{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WHA", "content": "\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio during the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n\nFrom WNYC radios is the is a miracle on the line I news and Colin show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations around the country I'm Jamie Floyd filling in for Jonathan Capehart\nEvery Monday through Thursday nights where here with the latest political news analysis and your calls\nAs always we begin with the day's top political news we have word now that the FBI report on the allegations against judge Brett Kavanaugh will be given to the Senate tomorrow\nAnd according to Senate Democratic wick whip Dick Durbin only one copy of the report is being delivered and each party will have to take turns viewing it\nIn one hour increment alternating between the parties this means it could take days if all one hundred senators want to see it\nListeners here's our question for you tonight how do you feel about this whole process are you satisfied that the FBI investigation will answer your remaining questions about judge Kavanaugh\nOr do you not have any questions at this point or are you just sick and tired of the whole thing call us up eight four four seven four or five talk\nAid for for seven four five eight to five five and joining us now from Washington is New York times congressional reporter Sheryl gay stole Berg\nCheryl I Can't think of any body better to speak with tonight then you let's start by reading a tweet tonight from Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy a Democrat and get your reaction and Cheryl let me first say thank you so much for being with us I'm happy to be here\nAll right so here's what Chris Murphy tweeted out less than an hour ago quote one copy of the FBI report no more than an hour or two of us know ability for any follow up center rushed to vote for two years and McConnell has been carefully am purposefully breaking the Senate\nThis is the final blow no comedy or traditions laugh it's just about\nPower politics end quote and sweet so Sheryl why don't we know about this strange planned to view the FBI report in these hour long increments [noise]\nWell I think we know that Mitch McConnell is really um determined to get the votes on this week I'm Brett Kavanaugh for Democrats are really angry as you heard of choice for senator Murphy they remember well\nAlong the way the interminable delay that McConnell imposed on the Senate\nWhen Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama and they remain serious about that um but Senator McConnell has said repeatedly that the Senate will vote this week we know the the um report are actually going to be a\nCollection of reports will be a stack of what's known as three oh twos those are documents reflecting interviewing notes from various witnesses those documents will be delivered to the Senate\nProbably later tonight but nobody is going to get to view them until tomorrow morning\nRight ten two of those witnesses do not include as far as our reporting reveals a the prints\nRhonda the Senate under oath ah\nBrett Kavanaugh and uh and and Dr bossy Ford or do you think this is going to be enough to satisfy key senators like Jeff Flake and the other two Republican Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the ones who insisted on this report before a full Senate vote\nWell we'll have to say what the what the results are I think that the FBI and the Republicans can probably make a pretty decent case that Dr block they forward and Brett Kavanaugh gave testimony over long a day\nAnd the and the Senate and so it was more important to air from these other witnesses potentially corroborating witnesses\nOr than it was from them since their views were well known nonetheless Democrats are ready to laying the groundwork to make an argument that this is a sham investigation or the two of them the two principal should've been interviewed\nUm whether that will sway the three Republicans I'm I don't know as we know Jeff Flake said\nAh last friday that he was inclined to vote he was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh then he had this encounter with female protestors in an elevator he heard their cries he felt the country was being ripped apart and so he kind of did an about face and ask for this\nFBI investigation but I think barring anything really surprising I Would think at least Jeff Flake will be voting for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd as you say he encountered those two women in the elevator in addition to that there has been considerable negative reaction to President Trump's mocking of Dr lousy Ford Brett Kavanaugh's accuser last night at a political rally in Mississippi\nI have one right I Want to be\nWell you think it was always wonder how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nI don't [noise]\nI don't know\n[noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where ... where was I don't know but I Wonder you\nKnow we can hear Trump supporters in the crowd cheering him on bought those critical Republican senators on Capitol Hill did not seem please today here's Maine's Susan Collins\nAre you comfortable the president's attacks on Christians Bobby board our president with a budget of doctors and the president's comments word just plain wrong\nAnd Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski\nAnd I think it's the president's along yesterday\nDr Ford were totally inappropriate and in my view unacceptable\nAnd here is notably Arizona's Jeff\nFlake on the today\nShow where I live there's no time and no place for ... for the SCA quarter rally\nAll right\nSo we were speaking a Cheryl gay soul work of the New York times about\nHow to critically Jeff Flake who are clearly is very conflicted was even before\nA the weekend and now is it seems being pushed a further and further on this issue and then of course the two female Republican senators I ...\nHe wants to close this vote 'em maybe he takes a risk bringing the vote to the floor if if he's not certain to have the numbers he needs [noise]\nWell I think one way or the other he's got to bring the vote to from the floor I Would note that Jeff Flake told me today that\nHe would not allow President Trump's comments to influences vote one way or the other he said you can't you know he was he wasn't happy about those comments but it's not going to sway his vote and I think at this point it's some\nI don't want to say put up or shut up time I mean they've got to have this vote\nAnd either Brett Kavanaugh's confirmed or he's not and so I'm McConnell is prepared to move forward with that I think McConnell is probably pretty confident that\nEven a narrowly divided Senate that he can get Kavanaugh through it's possible that we could see a fifty fifty split and vice president Mike Pence would have to come in and break a tie a that would be unprecedented certainly I'm\nIn modern Senate history I I Can't speak for the all the way back to the founding of the republic but that never happened before\nAnd any sense finally Cheryl on the timing will it be tomorrow\nWill be friday will be over the weekend I Can't imagine it will drag on until Monday\n[noise] no probably not so if the report is delivered tonight then Senator McConnell has said\nHe will file cloture that is basically Senate jargon for um initiating debate so he has said that once the report\nLands in the Senate he's going to do that that will start a thirty our clock ticking they're thirty hours of debate I'm so presumably a vote or to cut off debate could happen on\nA friday that would be a procedural vote and then final vote possibly on Saturday\n[noise] All right Sheryl ... thank you so much for joining us tonight we appreciate your view from Washington that six year old gay silver

I guess is the proper grammatical words or through the Fifteen thousand words are in the times these I and many of the documents\nBut um do you think\nAh Lauren that this matters in the end I mean we have people on the left\nOut with their heels again and people on the right or looking at the New York times with the I won't use the phrase Trump President Trump uses but they have a their land their political lens or we own our separate chambers yell any yelling at each other out with the facts we believed to be true well\nThanks for having me first I just have to correct one thing I ... I don't want to confuse anyone she's speaking at a woman in financial services of on that on together as her thing in New York in a couple of weeks and so I'll be really interested to hear\nWhat she has to say about it so just to correct that out of the gate but I Will say this I think that part of what is so complicated about this drip drip drip and then in this case a sort of an avalanche of reporting on\nFriday and implications of wrongdoing and odd that on top of the constantly growing daily barrage of a controversial issues that surround this White House\nIt's an incredibly difficult uh amount of information for average voters to sort through and I think what I worry about is that in\nDespite the surge of civic engagement certainly that we're seeing among women on the left which I think is a unquestionable there is record numbers of women running record numbers of women protesting calling their members of Congress are reaching out volunteering getting involved in the mid term elections\nI I Do worry about the sort of average voters ability to process this much stuff\nAnd to make decisions about it and I do think that the in the local and state elections that we are going to see in November I Do think for the next number of weeks we're going to see candidates across the board using this New York times story and then of course\nUsing and leveraging the cabinet controversy to really make every election in the country an election about Donald Trump or in hundreds of places where he's not running\nAndrea your thoughts as our ... our uh editor on politics and policy as as well as our trumping cohost what are your thoughts on the impact of a story like this on politics at the polls\nWell I think if we've learned anything in the past couple of years uh we should be cautious about trying to understand how things are going to affect voting patterns I mean I think that I'm\n\n\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday\nAs a donor to Wisconsin Public radio you're part of an amazing\nGroup of fifty four thousand members\nWho share your appreciation of unbiased news important discussion and high quality entertain a variety of programs the information on WPRI dot org\nEvents in your community newsletters and so much more it's all possible thanks to your support thank you for making a difference in Wisconsin [noise]\nSupport for WPRI comes from the twenty fifth annual fall our tour fifty five artist working in their studios in and around the mineral point dodge ... spring green unbearable October Nineteen through the twenty first fall art tour dot com\nWPRI podcast let you hear programs whenever you want your shows like the best of our knowledge and the politics podcast\nYou can find out more about all the WPRI podcast by going to WPRI dot org slash podcast\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[laughter]\nI'm Jamie Floyd infer Jonathan Capehart this is America on the line and we turn our attention now to some of the state races happening across the country and we go down to Texas where the G O P is in an unexpected fight in the Senate\nAnd beyond and a new if so online poll it has begun O'Rourke three points ahead of Republican Senator Ted Cruz and the contest for cruises Senate seat this is the first poll that has all roar ahead\nJoining us now from my mother's home town San Antonio Texas is it OK put on us where he covers congressional races for Texas He also covers immigration and lots more for the Huffington Post rotate thank you so much for joining America on the line tonight\n... well we have a call out for our listeners asking our listeners that if you are voting in Texas in the midterms please call us up we'd love to hear from you\nSeven four or five eight to five five we have heard for years that Texas\nIs on the verge of turning from deep red to blue or at least perhaps located to purple thanks to changing demographics in your state might this be the year let's start with the Senate race between Ted Cruz and challenger Beto O'Rourke and we're here\nTo argue that you know I support the second amendment [noise]\nIn what way and what are the facts and named one judge you never supported who would actually you might not\nSound on the house and Senate work but it's your job in the Senate to decide if you're going to support or not support but given your dollar sorry Clinton knock knock knocking on doors Phillies when that has nothing to do what they were promised I Want to learn how to mind gentlemen\nLet's move on hair All right let's [laughter]\nThat's why you're certainly have an a heck of a race race out there in Texas that was a clip from the congressional debate in Dallas a few weeks ago senatorial debate we should say\nAnd it really has been heated we said that that show has finally a been a head and at least one poll but generally how the race has been going how's he been polling is is it really a chance he's gonna win it\nWhere the polling sort of all over the place I mean you have that one poll that showing 'em up or what is it two or three points then you also have the I was botched the pronunciation with the Quinnipiac poll putting cruise up nine points\nUm and I think look to the bottom line here uh you know polling I think can lead to a lot of\nSort of faulty prediction ... definitely right but it's definitely true that it's a lot closer than anyone had any reason to expect are certainly a year ago\nOr even a few months ago I mean I think one of the things that are Rourke has really done is to drive so much energy behind progressive in Texas and really\nMobilized that base for the Democrats in a way that kind of is giving a party a little bit more confidence in a way that they haven't show\nUm I mean I think it's really telling if you look at that race in how competitive she's made it but then if you look elsewhere you know you don't really see a lot of the more prominent democratic members of the establishment throwing their\nHats into the statewide races this time around the roads actually kind of unique for really trying to take that chance\nAnd move the needle so I think whether or not a ... wins this race but I think she's doing a lot for the Democratic party in Texas and for the party's future you know I mean there for him to win would be a pretty massive achievement given how badly the party's done here recently ...\nBut for him to lose well\nUh I think is also really closing the gap after I remember that Wendy Davis lost the governor's race twenty fourteen but like twenty points spread\nRight tried and as you suggest he's he's polling well but he's big challenge\nIs voter turnout you've reported quote white non Hispanics makeup just forty two percent of the taxes population mirroring the demographics of solidly blue California\nBut Latinos have historically low voter turnout rate so so why is that are okay and how much of an impact is it going to have on the race in the event\nWas huge I mean if it ... once when he was going to have to win by driving up Hispanic turnout and by winning a larger share of those Hispanics who do turn out if if the demographics look the way they did last\nUh she's not going to win like it's a the math is very obvious but the issue here right is that Texas has some issues with the Latino vote that I think\nAre are very important for the public outside the state to understand uh you know people have a sort of tendency to look at the low levels of Latino voter turnout\nAcross the nation even and to sort of scratch their heads and say you know why why are these folks not exercising their civic duty when there's someone like Trump and office who's making very aggressive\nComments against immigrants or Mexicans broadly that many people in the Latino community do feel are offensive or threatening but you know it takes\nA certain sense of entitlement and I'd say that it's in the in the best possible sense of that word right to say that if something\nUh you know if if the political leaders are being aggressive against you that your response is going to be to go out and participate in public life and get yourself to city council and start changing these things right I think for people that are alienated from civic process\nFor people that may come from recent immigrant backgrounds are have mixed status families if you are not involved in civics process\nOr having someone\nSpeak so negatively or with such hostility towards your community might simply real from your in your your it's sort of decision\nTo kind of stay kind of keep your head down you know you hear this over and over again when you're talking particularly to a young folks right that they get that message a lock on their parents'\nDoing right and one of them are going to go ahead and one of ... gerrymandering and and and and voter suppression and voter id requirements the things we do hear about here in other states these heavy taxes\nThose are certainly an issue you have gerrymandering you've also had historically and some uh uh parts of taxes you know I don't know at large motor district the diluted this panic mode that had to be challenged in the courts\nOr the state voter id requirements which I'm certainly a concluded that span of ... and\nThen also other aspects of the system that are a little bit less a sort of highly politicized like for example in South Texas where you have\nA very large Hispanic population getting toward the border towns that are you know Ninety plus percent Hispanic\nNo show solidly democratic that they're racist are competitive and so you don't see the you know that fundamental dynamic driving people or to the polls so again I think what O'Rourke is trying to do and not be successful at will\nGive a slight a benefit to the Democratic party moving forward is to give people a reason\nUh to get to the ... to get to the polls he's you know he's putting a race that no one had any reason to suspect would be in play and play\nNow now immigration of course there's a huge issue in the upcoming mid term but I Would guess in taxes that's more important or at least arguably more important than any other state and you know President Trump continues to play up the year's around the issue like Ted Cruz is running on an anti immigration pro law enforcement", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison",
