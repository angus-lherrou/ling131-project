P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network [laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise] ...\n[noise] from WNYC radio and Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line alive political news and call in show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday night we're here with news analysis and your calls\nWe want to hear your opinions on the issues that matter most to you know coming up we'll be joined by one of the Democrat's biggest funders Tom's dire his best known these days where his knee to impeach organization\nIt's not winning him a lot of popularity contests within the Democratic party in fact party leaders seem to be running the other way but let's start though with the political news of the day and for that we're joined by the Washington bureau chief for huff post Amanda Terkel Amanda welcome back to America on the line\nGreat to be here so ... as we speak actually the president of the United states president Donald Trump is in Texas is doing a rally for a man he used to call lion head but now she calls him this [laughter]\n\nBeautiful Ted Texas Ted Amanda please explain what's happening here\n[laughter] well Ted Cruz needs to win is election against a very charismatic fat or work and Trump is still popular in Texas so he is swallowing has pride he is letting Trump campaigned for him and he is forgetting the fact that Trump during the campaign uh\nBasically accused a Cruz's father of assassinating JFK and talked about how ugly cruises wife was I mean\nIt's a little gross that Ted Cruz's willing to just move on and overlook all those really awful personal\nSlights and and you know that Trump bluffs it you know Trump is out there campaigning for people like Cruz who guided him didn't like him and now they desperately need him in order to win so basically a Trump is more popular than a lot of Republican lawmakers and they are embracing him\nI remember him in and maybe you were also there in Cleveland in the hall when Ted Cruz spoke at the Republican convention and criticize Donald Trump from the podium and was booed off the stage my how things have changed in the last two years\n[noise] yeah I Do remember that too I mean there was it was an intense Republican primary and I was also there and I remember the bowling and now you know beautiful tad a Trump I think his approval rating in general is up maybe a he is headed up for ... ah\nIt's his approval rating four percent more favorable that unfavorable and you know cruise is not a great campaigner federal rockets out they're racing record amounts of money getting people in Texas excited getting people around the country excited\nAnd in the last debate he went on the offensive against crews and Cruz is sort of doing whatever he can and we are seeing some of that is just overlooking everything he ever said about Trump and just for getting it happens\nYou know here's the thing they don't work has raised a ton of money or more money than I think one report said\nThat President Obama raised a at all at one point during his presidential runs and as you said he's very charismatic there seem to be a big wave of enthusiasm for him around the country and then a poll came out\nWho's the bigger or work is behind Ted Cruz has always been the dynamic in that campaign that this really is a race for Ted Cruz to lose\nAbsolutely I mean there is a very good chance uh even though Cruz without running the best campaign and he's not a great campaigner or that he will still when Texas is still a red state he is still a Republican and he will probably win but the fact that it's been so close and\nRepublicans are so worried about it and watching it so closely just shows a sort of the strengths of Beddoes campaign\nLike you said he's raised a record amount of money it's more money than Jeb Bush raised during his entire presidential run and twenty sixteen\nAnd he is really changing things for the way Democrats and maybe Republicans fundraise going forward relying on small dollar donors are treating his uh supporters and funders with respect sort of different than some of the spam that you see coming from the other party committees\nSo his influence will be felt long after the race even if he loses\nSo amendment ... there was some action uh in court along the lines of cases involving voter suppression was there not [noise]\nRight and we saw in New Hampshire a far from Texas out judging right Hampshire on today today blocked a state law that would have required additional documentation from voters\nWho moved to the state within thirty days of an election and we're starting to see this pop up\nIn a few other places Georgia most notably wherever voters who said that they're going to be able to vote suddenly aren't going to be able to if they don't fix something and might not be able to at all because there are discrepancies in Georgia a for example uh\nYour your registration what you fill out the form must back exactly what the state has that file and they're all all these sorts of clerical errors there might be a draft I fit in there might be a small\nA number issue if that doesn't match and you don't challenge it you can't vote but the problem is that some voters said that they never knew there was a problem and so they may show up on election day and they may not be able to vote and the real\nIssue here is that it's predominantly affecting voters who are minorities\nOr let's jump from New Hampshire and voter suppression in across the world to to turkey and the latest in the investigation and the latest on the the murder of ... my colleague at the Washington Post on the opinion section\nOf the latest news amended that the CIA director Gina Haspel is on her way to turkey what's the significance of the [noise]\nWell it's significant because I mean she's ahead of U.S intelligence services obviously and Turkish officials so far has been a little leery about sharing what they have which includes the audio that captures the killing and so\n... Gina Haspel supposedly will be able to hear and see what the Turkish officials have which is they say clear evidence that the Saudis\nWere involved in deliberately killing changed ... and then the question is whether this intelligence and what the CIA directors cheese will be enough to convince Trump and his administration that sure enough the Saudis and the crown prince were involved\nYou know the Turkish leader everyone is promising details tomorrow in our time should be early early tomorrow morning any idea how as to how forthcoming or the Turkish leader will be in those details\nI don't know yet but you would ... I think that they are going to be increasingly forthcoming I mean the the details we've learned so far\nAre just unbelievable that they brought a guy who looked like James ... so that they could protest\nMake it look like the journalist wasn't dead you know they brought this a medical expert who specialized in autopsies and then you have the Saudis out there saying that no no no this was just a fist fight that bad\nI said the details that Turkish officials have released so far I have been pretty incredible and now I think what some people are waiting for it that this initiative audio to show them talking about the killing\nAnd now let's bring it back to North America and the story that I'm sure the president has probably brought up in his rally by now and that is the caravan of migrants who are making their way from Central America through Mexico trying to make their way to the ... the border between the United states and Mexico\nThe president is saying that this is all the Democrats fault I'm\nIn fact today Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House press secretary told reporters that President Trump was quote as\nAbsolutely she's a credible evidence or Middle East middle Easterners in the Margaret caravan have we seen any evidence to back that up\nYeah there is no evidence to back that up a that's just simply an attempt to make it seem that these people are are scary that they are trying to come here to commit violent crimes if not terrorist attacks it's just honestly racist fear mongering\nAh there is absolutely no evidence of that the Trump Administration uh\nYou know immigration is a rallying cry for many people in the Republican base and with Republicans are struggling a couple of weeks out Fifteen days away from the election they are turning to issues like immigration\nThey're turning to issues like NFL players kneeling the sort of social issues that they think will get their base excited\nAnd one more issued to talk about in the little bit of time that we have left um special counsel Robert Mueller news has come out that he's focusing in on Roger Stone and his WikiLeaks connection what's that about\nWell Roger Stone or had some very suspicious tweets where he said that shot to death to who was Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman a will be soon find himself basically and hot water\nAfter we come back on the panel will be back later in the show when we return as promised ... one of the Democratic party's biggest donors here to talk about the chances\nOf the blue wave and it's personal project impeachment you're listening to America on the line\nYou're listening to America on the line from WNYC as it happens returns in its entirety on friday November second\n\n[noise] my name is Gary McCoy and I'm from Appleton to me the best thing about Wisconsin Public radio is that it's there for me every day of the year on Thanksgiving Day I traveled a hundred miles to celebrate with family and I had public radio I'm throwing my trip over what a hundred miles and the programming was just awesome\nAnd as I traveled from Appleton commercials I simply change from WNPR in Green Bay to WPRI muscle and never lost to be\nIncluded in your state plan visit WPRI legacy dot org\nSupport for WPRI comes from Rogers behavioral health providing treatment for addiction depression and mood disorders and children teens and adults programs are available at locations throughout Wisconsin Rogers be age dot org\nSupport also comes from an F PC live presenting Trevor Noah loud and clear tour February eight that the alliance energy center Trevor Noah is an author comedian and host of the Daily Show tickets are at ticket master dot com\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I mean\nI I hear you when you're talking about you know Democratic Party elites in Washington who are against this and they don't want to do because they're closing up but there are non Washington elites who don't like the idea of talking about impeaching the president\nMean actually if you go to the videotape Jonathan and go to pulse you will see that Seventy eight percent of Democrats want this president impeached and removed from office that the other twenty two percent about half of them don't and half of them don't know so actually when you\nSupport for WPRI comes from four imprint providers a promotional products for businesses including embroidered apparel trade show giveaways and logo business gifts more about the four imprint dedication to customer satisfaction is that for imprint dot com\nWhen we're talking about Democrats it's overwhelmingly that the people around the country agree with us actually\nOkay so I'm at the beginning of the show and before the segment I ask people to call in whether they are for or against an effort to impeach the president asked people to call a a four four seven four or five eight to five five ... in St Louis called in here thank you for calling into America on the line [noise]\nYou're welcome so would you like to see President Trump impeached for not impeached\nNot impeach ... anything that your guest to shed is incorrect but because of what would replace him [noise] I Do not want to see a president [noise]\nI Do not want the evangelical surreal law become the law of the land what I Want is for twenty twenty\nTo show that the majority of the American people do not want that kind of leadership anymore [noise]\nGreat need for me being not impeached already\nBeaten at the ballot box T I thank you very much for calling in from St Louis we tear raises a very good point if you impeach President Trump and his and succeed in getting to super majority of votes in the Senate to convict and remove President Trump for off from office\nYou get that our president hands there are a lot of Democrats who are afraid of that what do you say to them who have that well let\nMe say gee is bringing up a very important point that we've heard in every single one of the thirty seven town halls that we've done around the United states to discuss this issue everybody including me\nWho is on the Democratic side finds Mr Pence's attitudes and policy stances at odds with ours and some of them are really upsetting and reporting it\nSo I completely agree but when we look at either the impeachment of the president or the twenty eighth team mid term election mid term elections we have to realize that we are not going to solve every problem at once\nThe first thing that we need to do in two weeks\nIs to take a gigantic step forward in terms of doing exactly what she is talking about we just to get the poll the only poll that counts from the American beauty launches the midterm vote saying that in fact in this basic referendum on this administration the majority of Americans deeply disagree actually\nFar as Tom ... thank you so much time flew thank you very much for being on America on the line when we come back to the\nPanel is going to come back we're going to talk about this and others\nYou are listening to America on the line from ... in my see what's happened returns in its entirety on friday November second\n\n[noise] every day on central time we celebrate life in Wisconsin and what our state has given to the nation and the world\nFrom Georgia O'Keefe to less mall we learned about Wisconsin I pass them resident who made their Martin tune into central time for looking for people who make our state and great place to call home weekday afternoon from three until seven or online anytime WPRI died or Mm\nSupport for WPRI comes from the history museum at the castle in Appleton\nGridiron glory and the best of the pro Football Hall of fame and exhibited featuring stories about the racial integration of professional football\nMy history museum dot org Wisconsin Public radio brings you thoughtful and engaging discussions everyday authors artists politicians and voices from around the state you hear them all and you can be part of the conversation too on air or online at WPRI dot org\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

our panel Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham University\nRepublican strategist Doug Hi from Washington and also in Washington democratic strategist Maria ... will be taking your calls also in this segment specifically\nHere's the question well\nWe have a lot of talk about impeachment for the last what were the last twenty minutes I don't want to ask about that question anymore let's whatever is on your mind that is not impeachment related\nGive us a call eight four four seven four or five eight to five five when I Do want to uh talk about is to actually go back a\nAnd Christina I Want to get your um your thoughts on the immigration discussion that we were having at the beginning of the show to Doug Doug gave his thoughts Maria gave her thoughts\nUh shaking your head and not and I want to know what you were thinking or what you think about all\nThis yeah I mean I I Do think that this is part of Trump's greatest hits you know when he has not produced the wall which is the main thing that his supporters in his base want but he can sort of whip out the racist rhetoric whenever necessary and I do think that he will use these visuals to his advantage\nSo many of his supporters have forgotten that they to our children and grandchildren of immigrants they may not necessarily being from Latin America they may be from Europe\nBut they've forgotten that they came to this country oftentimes not with my chin often times of the country that didn't necessarily want them even though they were from Europe\nI'm thinking of people who were coming from Italy and Ireland Ryan aries and all these other places we're now in Germany and Poland all of a sudden now it's time to shut the borders and I do think that Trump will use this visual because unfortunately so many of his supporters\nDon't see families they don't see children we've seen his supporters say you know these women don't want their children taken away from them and they shouldn't be coming to the border and what they're not understanding of the things\nThat America does to other nations that make it such that people need and want to leave\nI there's so many economic things that this country does to others on either starving them or providing them with you know propping up dictators are putting in you know sort of military regimes and the people have to leave their nation or has\nBeen reported MS Thirteen at the president goes on about is actually a California export yet when the folks were deported\nWe know and resident doesn't like nuance and so the fact that he will just throw in oh yeah and I think I see some Middle Eastern middle Easterners we also know that you know Fox News and in his talk radio Sarah gets will pick that up\nAnd carried as truth and unfortunately his supporters they don't need to look for facts they just want to know that whatever it is that they had in this country quote unquote being taken away from them\nAs the timing of all of this is also very curious how all of a sudden that targeting about thousands of people making they're making their way north if anybody wants to to to touch on that please jumped in but\nHaving said all that and this is something that I wanted to get to in the in the first segment of the the show and we couldn't get there's going to get there now\nPresident Trump's job approval rating after everything we have seen and been through has ticked up Doug\n... forty seven percent in the latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll to see what is going on here why is it the Kavanaugh bumps still or is it something else for both well I think I think it is important the Kavanaugh\nBumped up really brought a lot of Republicans home um and some of that as natural as you get to the waning days of of the ... cycle anyways\nUm is also were robust economy that are basically every week we hear a more good news about and that's something that Trump can can tell and and run on frankly I Wish you'd do more of that um and I'll tell you Jonathan I saw that I'm told is pretty close up in\nUm Nashville where I was about a month ago and\nUm and how it impacts the Senate races people were uh that I talked to were very torn I'm even Blackburn supporters like British and thought Brett us and was going was ultimately going to wait even a word they weren't voting for him and most voters think the person that they're voting for is going to win\nA British and was was really hurt by the fact that for a long time she wouldn't take a position on um the capital nomination even though that's something he would vote on a as a senator and ultimately I'm at the very end so that he supported them so he lost a lot of credibility in the state\nUm and that's part of the cabinet bumped that has has affected Trump and and certainly a lot of Republican candidates well one thing I'll say is a point of comparison a when I was at the Republican National committee in too\nNumber for ... was I'm forty six we felt if he was below that on election day uh that that we'd win back the house and you know we're obviously not election day yet but I don't think anybody would think that ... or you know a year ago that Donald Trump would be one point two points higher than ... Bible was given that the districts\nToday are um more homogeneous or more on favoring incumbents then then that was the case in two thousand ten uh this is good news for Republicans in for the first time maybe they don't have windows their backs but they don't feel that they're running head first into a a very scary when Martin I'm Maria\nDi ... with Doug\nI agree that Democrats should be concerned and I have always been one to\nWarn against talk of the blue wave because we have always known that Trump is completely unpredictable we don't know what his effect on elections are we all thought twenty sixteen was going to go one lane and didn't\nUm I I I think that it will still be a good day for Democrats are there are a lot of things that are going on in the districts\nThat are heavily favor Democrats the candidates that we haven't been able to\nRecruit has been phenomenal they have been running on health care they had been running on an economy that has only worked for the point zero one percent they had been running on a tax scam that Republicans have passed that has not help the middle class or working class voters\nWell actually we are they they haven't been running on the on the tax cuts and that reminds me to\nLet her know Democrats are a lot of Republicans are not only because we haven't gotten anything nor will we right exactly exactly so uh uh sorry to cut you off but none of us on Doug on on the tax cuts that was this huge\nAccomplishment or that the Republicans and the president got through there is the like jam Murray on the\nRose Garden of the White House\nAnd yet they're crickets\nOn the campaign trail when it comes to this why aren't Republicans running up to a midterm election championing the number one thing that they've been talking about for decades\nWell I think to some extent they are they're talking about the economy and ultimately the Republican argument is and you can agree with it or disagree with it is if the bill would have a um\nA a great effect on the economy and so if we have an economy that's that's booming Republicans are talking about that they're talking about that in their districts are talking about in the states they may not be saying here's my thirty second ad on the tax cut bill but they are talking about the economy there's there's no doubt about that and that's one of the things\nThat is really bussing Republicans I'm In these in these states as they look at what\nUm you know I Would agree with Maria was always premature to talk about um a blue wave especially since we've been talking about one for all year now um but but Republicans are busting you know some of some of the things that have been coming against them\nBecause there's such a great economy it's again one of these things it allows Donald Trump to be forty seven percent which like Donald Trump or you know or if you don't like Donald Trump you never thought that he would be forty seven percent ... we're not we're not at the end game yet with the elections", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "23"}
