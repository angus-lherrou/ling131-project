P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n[noise] from WNYC radio and Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line alive news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWith five weeks until election day there is much to discuss it appears that the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's nomination has been expanded after protests from Democrats over its original limited scope there were more angry accusations in the Senate today over how the cabinet nomination to the Supreme Court was handled\nAnd threats of retribution in the future from both sides\nAnd all of this partisan drama is having an impact on candidates political fortunes and looks like we're in for another bumpy week which got us wondering\nWhat can we regular everyday folks do to calm things down can we minimize the tribal bickering the distrust the rage from all sides\nDo you have to deal with the situation in your own family we want to hear your ideas give us a call at eight four four seven four or five talk that's eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five you can also send us a tweet as always using using the hash tag a O T L\nMeanwhile this is the first Monday in October so that means it was the first day of the new session of the Supreme Court\nWith all the drama swirling around the Kavanaugh nomination is it just business as usual in the highest court in the land here to talk about this is Jeff braving Supreme Court correspondent for the wall Street Journal Jeff welcome to America on the line great to be here\nSo just following the chaos of the last week that we've all been watching what was the mood or the feeling inside the court today as they have their first day or their first day back in session a it was like\nLiving on another planet the Supreme Court or\nDoes not uh have anything at all to do with politics as the justices or remind us\nUh in the scene inside the Supreme Court was one of it's a very very a formal traditional ways was the first day of the new term the chief justice said he had the honor of closing out the last term and beginning of the new one\nHe began with a very a brief a congratulations to his colleague a Ruth Bader Ginsburg noting that uh this was the\nTwenty fifth anniversary of her invested sure as a justice of the Supreme Court and speaking on behalf of all\nA seven of her colleagues said that uh we uh we look forward to to many more years in our common calling with you so then they just got down to the business Warren new attorneys and her their first two cases\nSo in one of your articles from yesterday to your point about the justices well I'm not getting involved in politics you quote judge a justice Elena Kagan saying quote we should be aware of the environment and not unnecessarily exacerbate the divisions that unfortunately exist now\nShe said this on September twelfth before the cabin on proceedings went into full blown chaos mode but on a personal level\nHow are the justices responding to their branch being at the center of such a painful fight [noise] well\nKnow they ah they take I think all of them take very seriously whether they usually the institutional credibility of the court it's well taught strong law schools they all know him very well that the courts\nArmy at their disposal they they they simply a exert power through the credibility of their decisions uh and so\nThe institutional legitimacy of the court is something that they all we'll talk about now what might threaten it uh maybe differences to different justices\nBut I don't think any of them like the idea of a a a a very political and personal a fight over a appointing a new justice I I Can't think that any of them uh feel this is good for the reputation of the Supreme Court which really does seek to say that what it does is different\nFrom what the other two branches of government do\nI'm Glad you brought that up we're going to be talking about this with the panel later on in the show but this\nThey the notion of the institutional credibility of the court and I keep thinking back to what um judge Kavanaugh said last Thursday where he railed against Democrats on the panel on the Senate Judiciary committee panel\nWhere he talked about a conspiracy of uh people trying to exact revenge on him um through the Clintons\nHow just talk like that from that Supreme Court nominee how does that have an impact on the institutional credibility of the court I Can't imagine that the sitting justices\nLike hearing that [noise] well\nI you know I don't know what they would like to I don't know whether they even watched it ah\nI mean judge Kavanaugh certainly came to the bench in the DC circuit where you are currently sets with a very strong partisan pedigree but once on the DC circuit\nHe's certainly took steps to distance himself from that passed I mean he he seems to registering as a Republican you you know you you then became an independent or decline to state\nOr he certainly no longer you know would have a you know contributed a political campaigns are done anything directly involved in in in partisan politics\nUh and he works a it seemed very hard for a dozen years to develop a different reputation and that was reflected in his a very high rating by the American bar association and buy things that you know I other reporters heard about\nHis his performance on the circuit court and the views of his colleagues even those with you know different uh ideological persuasion Z\nA his you know his work teaching is higher you know we're grades from from students who he taught at a law schools\nAre so he certainly like many judges has a political background many of the judges on the court Supreme Court now at a political background I mean you know you gotta know somebody to get appointed by the president and that often is through politics\nOr budge recently certainly in the face of of these are allegations are by by by Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford and and and the other ones that are very um [noise]\nUh I guess a sort of judicial a persona that he had cultivated a fell away to a degree and uh you know whether the other justices think that was a reasonable or not and the circumstances I I Can't say but it's certainly will be in the mind of litigants who come to the court and are looking to\nCount the five that's the majority they need to win the case they're going to be thinking about what you know pushes each justices buttons and they got a you know perhaps more insight into into what what makes a Brett Kavanaugh tick\nWell right now there are only eight justices on the Supreme Court so how is the absence of a ninth justice influencing the docket this term [noise] well it's not just eight\nJustices it's eight justices were divided evenly a by\nGeneral philosophy or judicial ah ideology doesn't mean that will always have four liberals against for conservatives but in many of the more a\nSignificant kind of hot button cases that is what the line up will be and so if they want to get to a majority there\nHas to at least one person has to move over a ... and join for a of the others are and we have an idea of what that looks like from the time that a Justice Scalia died uh and uh the vacancy persisted in Institute twenty Seventeen and the court took more\nModest steps that did last uh because uh you needed to uh to find a way that you could have people are very different views agree\nSo if the court persist set an eighth justice a number for a longer period you know it probably will look like that or if However I'm a\nYou know judge Kavanaugh or one of of similar a philosophy is is confirmed then I think will a terminal look more like like the last term which was very conservative and it's and most of its outcomes\n[noise] in the interim while you have eight justices what happens if they can't agree at all or if they divide for for\nA then the lower court ruling stands as it is but it doesn't not create a national precedent of the court could also order a re arguments after it gets a another justice that has happened from time to time historically and Nineteen I'm fifty three chief justice Vincent died a Earl Warren\nWas appointed as the new chief justice and he re heard that the court we heard brown versus board of education and and chief justice Warren than than ... next term wrote the a unanimous opinion striking down school segregation so there's a example of a re arguments after one member of the court dies\nSo let's say hypothetically a judge Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court and the four four split is eliminated if that happens how how does how would that change the cases they choose to hear this term\n[noise] well I'm hard to know I mean it takes four votes to put a case on the docket but five votes to win in general [noise] ah so ah but they're keeping an eye on on on on what's happening I think that the Supreme Court probably like\nMost of us are assumed that uh Brett Kavanaugh would be confirmed and time for the new term or or or soon thereafter uh I don't think they had any you know including the something would happen I mean there's always a possibility but it looked pretty pretty smooth\nAnd how the question we're going to be talking about his has the Supreme Court ever seen this kind of political divide or are we in uncharted waters\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday\nGets election season Wisconsin Public radio in going beyond the ballot we want to know are you going to vote this year and why Cedric Alice has not\nSaid he only them\nI think about my

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[noise]\n[noise] I'm Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line if there's one thing most of us can probably agree on is that last Thursday Senate Judiciary committee hearing and which Dr Christine Blasey Ford and judge Brett Kavanaugh testified\nWasn't emotional deeply disturbing display and judge Kavanaugh's tone was a far cry from his last appearance before the committee\nThis statement in particular gave many people pause\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fuels with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nCompare that to how judge Kavanaugh described the correct judicial temperament in twenty Fifteen at Catholic university\nTo be a good judge in a good umpire it's important to have the proper demeanor really important I think to walk and the others choose whether it be the other litigants or the lead against in the case the other judges to understand them to keep our emotions in check\nTo be calm admits the storm on the bench to to put it in the vernacular don't be a jerk I think that's important\n[noise] so I wanted to play those two clips because I just want to know\nIf this is a new normal for ... for the Supreme Court and\nHave we ever seen the Supreme Court so politicized before and I'm gonna bring in a in a presidential historian a Supreme Court historian a little bit later in this segment but I wanted to bring in my panel now to talk this through and joining me in the studio is WNYC is Brian Lehrer host of the Brian Lehrer show\nIn Los Angeles Rolling Stone senior writer Tamil Smith\nAnd from Washington syndicated columnist Mona ... welcome all Bryan since you were here in the studio with me those two clips I'm back to back are rather stark\nCompared to like what we saw last week and I I'm just wondering how is it possible that one person can showed diametrically opposed temperaments\n[noise] I guess the question is which is the real Brett Kavanaugh and which is in fact\nYou know there was a lot of reporting in the last week\nThat President Trump in particular deciding whether to stick with Brett Kavanaugh or bail on him did not like how passively came across from Fox News interview a week ago and told them you better dial it up when he gets to that hearing or somehow got word to him to that effect\nUm and so we saw a Brett Kavanaugh who really does have the judicial temperament that he's displayed in his years on the bench and in that second clip\nDialing it up for a fact because that's what he thought would resonate with the base and save his nomination or\nThe real Brett Kavanaugh got revealed as a partisan warrior um and the masks come off and now he can't be trusted on the Supreme Court ah to be you know even handed when things have partisan overtones and I don't know the answer which is which\nAre monitoring the same question to you [noise] [noise]\nWell you have to bear in mind that a\nWhile I was not crazy about the uh the invocation at the Clintons and the suggestion that this is a partisan witch hunt and so forth that the\nThat Kavanaugh engaged in here was a man who had been accused of the most gruesome crimes\nUm whose entire reputation which two weeks ago was sterling and the ... in their highest possible rating and people of all backgrounds um who have known him and argued cases before him on the DC circuit court that he served on honorably for twelve years\nYou know selling his praises and and reiterated that yes he had the judicial temperament and yes he was fair minded and and a civil and wonderful to everybody who ever appeared before him and on and on\nAnd suddenly all of that is completely trashed tea is being accused of these gruesome\nCrimes and um so yeah he was he was deeply emotional he was defending his reputation and as I say he probably dial it up a T to use the phrase that was just used he probably dial up too high and down and it was it was inappropriate but\nTotally understandable when his entire life and reputation has been called into question\nYou know I Know you and I probably want to jump in and jumping on this idea we learned today that the FBI investigation into the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nHad been somewhat expanded and the fate of his nomination may all come down to not whether he drank a lot as a high school and college student but whether he lied to Congress about it\nWhich President Trump didn't seem to get when he was talking to reporters at the White House today take a listen to this\nBut I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched him and saying that he did have difficulty as a young man [noise]\nAsk is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him in many many years they go back to high school\n... this is what this is one of those situations where you know if you look on Twitter and social media and there are people who are pointing out the various areas where judge Kavanaugh his statements and\nHad been seem to have been found to be a bit contradictory shall we say [laughter]\nUm [laughter] uh ... ... ...\nWith the president doing this to cow the cabin on the way he did it does the president help or hurt judge Kavanaugh on this\nI think the president is trying to redefine the terms of the debate and I think that he's certainly I'm sure accomplishing that with a certain segment of Americans populist\nBut at the law in the long run it's not necessarily about the allegations themselves and whether or not they can be proven by the FBI investigation or Senate traditionally investigation and whatnot but it is about how\nJudge Kavanaugh reacted to those allegations how do you show your temperament how do you show your ability to not only remain composed but also to make sure that your ... your judicial a judgment not to you know double up on those words and\nYou can be trusted and frankly I think you know he's shown unequivocally that he cannot be trusted to\nYou know your case fairly hike notch rumbled to think what would happen should have Planned Parenthood ordinary Raul or what have you uh be involved in a suit before the Supreme Court and which he's on the bench\nBecause there's no chance in the world you know person who's quoting Clinton conspiracy theories and and and all this other uh you know\nSort of juvenile reaction that he had to the uh the allegations there's no way in the world that he would hear that case fairly and that they can expect that to the court would be or you know in fact what it's supposed to be the blueberry legitimacy of the court is a question here\nYou know Brian what's your mail says brings me back to something that just brave enough to Wall Street journal the Supreme Court reporter at the journal said pretty pointed out that you know judge Kavanaugh before he was appointed to the DC circuit\nHe was a political operative he was in the in the administration of President George W. Bush he worked in the Ken Starr um the Ken Starr pro but once he got on the bench\nShe's been an exemplary a judge so is is Janelle being hyperbolic when he says now that judge Kavanaugh can't be trusted to hear a case fairly given judge Kavanaugh's track record in the DC circuit\nWhen we come back the other political news of the day and it was we're going to be taking your calls where you're still going to be talking about Kavanaugh's but what is your prescription for the toxic political atmosphere that divides us what do you do to get along with family and friends whose political\nPolitics or the opposite of your own aid for for some four or five eight\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday\n\nWisconsin Public radio seeks a dynamic development professional and strategic leader to advance our major and playing giving department are striding fundraising program is committed to strategic donor engagement to generate revenue for the stations award winning content\nA complete position description for the director of major and plan giving it's available at WPRI dot org slash jobs the University of Wisconsin is an equal opportunity employer for best consideration apply by October Eighteenth\nSupport for WPRI comes from North London college hosting the launch of the second edition of Peter ... book the great lakes water wars at discovery world in Milwaukee October third\nRegistration is that north when dot edu slash water wars Wisconsin Public radio brings the state together with reports from our seven bureaus around the state and conversations about topics that matter to you WPRI as your connection to the pulse of Wisconsin we are your source for in depth news from Wisconsin the U.S and the world\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

question how do we get our warring political tries to chill out do you have family and friends who strongly disagree with politically\nHow do you make it work our number is eight four four seven four or five eight to five five and I would love to hear from Republicans who are trying to deal with their progressive their progressive friends and family who just don't get it\nNow last Thursday we asked where your overall impression after watching Dr blog the Ford and judge Kavanaugh testify we had dozens of calls after we went off the air and here are few who recorded their opinions on her voicemail\nSame thing I'm only ... back and tell us our young Arlington they serve on us from Chicago I'm responding to the question of how you feel about the hearing like one of the some of our act when I was young I\nHave a problem that we're telling the truth is almost impossible to say\nOne is definitely lying or talking about school [laughter] shame he showed critically and not only that he no longer have judicial temperament crocodile tears from Kevin Oh that is deeply part is I don't know if that somebody walk on our Supreme Court and I am so mortified I\nMean she John ... thing can\nRe joining me now monitoring syndicated columnist from Washington stimulus Smith senior writer for Rolling Stone in Los Angeles and here in New York in Studio with me Bryan lair hosts of WNYC use the Brian Lehrer show\nNow the FBI has now interviewed one of Brett Kavanaugh's friends from high school PJ Smith his lawyer released a statement this afternoon quote he truthfully answer every question they asked me I asked him and consistent with the information he previously provided to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee he indicated that he has no knowledge of the small party are gathering described by Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nNor does he have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh this comes from Arab Bruce ah PJ Smith lawyer and ah he wrote this in a statement on Monday so that's a catching everybody up on this but let me come to you because in this investigation\nThat the FBI is now conducting that has to be done by friday\nThere's been a little ... ... a little confusion at one point the investigation was going to be limited but then the president said no it's not limited I Want them to talk to everybody but the FBI's not talking to everybody right [noise]\nUh well I'm not sure uh they can't possibly talk to everybody in the time a lot it um but ah there does have to be some rule of reason on how deep to go into this\nUm and um and while\nDr Christine Blasey Ford was very persuasive um [noise] it is also true that we haven't heard from her parents we haven't heard from a until today that we hadn't heard from the other people at the party that is not fuller statements and and interviews so\nYou know it is it is um\n[noise] necessary to ah to get a little bit more clarity on what might have happened but we also have to have some modesty here it was thirty six years ago the chances of a really thorough investigation on her thing anything at this point are probably limited so we we have to live with that ambiguity I think\nJim ... do we have to have some modesty here I mean wouldn't it make sense to talk to mark judge to talk to Deborah Ramirez to talk to a um Julius ... uh yeah I miss sweat neck\nOf course it would [noise] and if we you know it's certainly possible that they can do so but it seems to easily ... per the report that was published by the New Yorker or by Jane Mayer route feral that it seems like the FBI has been slow footing this investigation to say the least\nOf people who are key to you know finding out the truth have nothing contract to people who have tried to volunteer that information had been refused only saw one the former associate of who's\nA Yale ... published a steep it in the New York times because Brinkley he hadn't had a chance to be heard by the FBI so I think the artificial time limit put on this is ridiculous I think that it's obviously a you engineer to produce a certain outcome but at the same time I think the truth can emerge if does it sharper\nBrian can the truth of merge\nOr the truth lie to emerge maybe just a partial truth would emerge and to that point there may be an incredible historic historical irony\nKevin not having worked on the Clinton investigation in the nineties and having said that thing last week about revenge on behalf of the Clintons the focus may wind up shifting increasingly from what actually happened uh the party that Dr Ford remembers to whether Kavanaugh is being truthful\nAnd Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about sex under oath\nOne of the things the FBI is possibly investigating like now is whether Brett Kavanaugh lied about sex under oath that contentious hearing last week there was that phrase in his year book we're not alone in\nWhich he said was not a reference to a girl who some guys allegedly had sex with and they turned out that it was and the other allies\nRelated to sex that even if it turns out there is no evidence demonstrating sexual assault that they may be checking in if any of that turns out to be a demonstrable why real lie well Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about sex under oath\nThat that is an interesting parallel you you bring up their Brian I'm I asked for a Republican\n... Republicans to call in to talk about how they're dealing with their progressive friends and family in this contentious time that we're in an Andrew in St Louis Missouri called in Andrew thank you for calling into America on the line for\nOh hi Hi I'm Andrew in the first time ever called in to a radio program but uh this is great a great show I Love that love listening to it um\nAnd anyways uh I always I tried engaged but uh it's ... times difficulty I'm I'm a big city than I Am a Republican but yet I just try to\nRead about their level I kinda know what they're what the counter points they're going to give me are but I I Try to try and talk about things like gun control and judge Kavanaugh and all these other things and try to\nTry to ease into the subject a little bit because I don't want to keep all my friends still want to they want to work with these people or other people [laughter]\nPeople but [laughter] you know are terrific ... Andrew so when you when you're talking to your friends about gun control I Am and judge Kavanaugh um ...\nSince you've been talking about judge Kavanaugh let's let's stick with him what is the one thing that you hear from your progressive friends and family that I'm completely disagree with and try\nTo convince them um to come around to your point of view [noise]\nUh it's it's mostly whether or not the whole thing was either a political hit job or is truly a sex sex assault or um it's it's difficult to kind of [noise] kind of combat that at a kind of a\nAt a a cover my ah like a nice little angle that that uh but\nI Do I Try to try to point out when when the allegations came to light the coincidence of when it happened but I I Believe is open that possibility that yeah it could be a bad guy and this whole a compromise is a good thing or that the Republicans are doing to uh", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "02"}
