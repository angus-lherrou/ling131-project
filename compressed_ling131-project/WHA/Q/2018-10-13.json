[noise]\nFrom the new for now is provided them forward by friends of Wisconsin Public television\nI'm Frederica fiber with Wisconsin Public television and I'm Shawn Johnson with Wisconsin Public radio in less than six weeks voters go to the polls to elect Wisconsin's next US Senator\nFor the next half hour we will compare and contrast to candidates and the wrong they are US Senator Tammy Baldwin first elected in twenty twelve and state senator live oak near first elected to the legislature in two thousand two\nWill begin to the latest from the campaign trail and me and joined in Studio by Wisconsin Public Radio's Laurel white we interviewed each of the candidates in recent weeks what she'll here tonight are excerpts from those interviews\nBut first while these candidates stand in sharp contrast on nearly every issue there is one rises to the top health care\nHealth care and specifically coverage for people with\nProminently in the U.S Senate race in Wisconsin\nRepublican candidate Leah Vukmir is a nurse and wants to repeal the Affordable CARE Act the law that includes prohibiting insurance companies from refusing coverage for people with preexisting conditions\nThe law also prohibits charging on limiting benefits\nThe incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin is running hard on her support for the CIA ended protections for preexisting conditions\nShe cites her own childhood illness the blocked her from getting coverage for her personal understanding\nOf the issue\nKaiser Family foundation poll released this month showed but nationally Seventy five percent of those surveyed wants to keep provisions prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage because of a person's medical history and Seventy two percent don't want insurers to be able to charge sick people more\nIn Wisconsin for more than eight hundred fifty thousand people have preexisting medical conditions according to Kaiser Health policy\nProgram director at the U. W. Madison population health Institute Donald Freed them\nAt least about twenty five percent of adults in Wisconsin have some kind of excluded preexisting condition what are those include\nThey couldn't include I mean we think of the the the significant things like diabetes or heart disease but they could include asthma they can include ... fairly common conditions\nWisconsin through state attorney general Brad channel is taking a lead along with Nineteen other states in a lawsuit to overturn the Affordable CARE Act which would of course get rid of its protections for people with preexisting conditions here's Tammy Baldwin\nRight now one of the biggest concerns on the minds of Wisconsin nights is health care in particular they've seen a fight last year where they almost saw their health care ripped away and the protections ripped away\nOn right now after we narrowly defeated that legislation we're seeing the administration tried to unravel it as well as a case that's going up to the Supreme Court ultimately to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions\nIowa leading that fight in the ... set out of the United states I Know what it was like to have a childhood illnesses and be labeled as a child with a preexisting condition\nAnd challenger Leah Vukmir\nI support protecting people with preexisting conditions we did it here in Wisconsin um before it was even part of Obamacare I support bringing health care\nDecision making back to the states I'm a strong proponent of the principle of federalism states know best how to take care of their own and before the Affordable CARE Act was put in place\nWisconsin had one of the lowest uninsured rate we had a robust insurance market and we had a program for people with preexisting conditions and we had to get rid of that because of the one size fits all Obamacare I firmly believe that we can do better in Wisconsin and we should and we would take care of people with preexisting conditions\nBook mirror refers to a program made defunct in Wisconsin by the CIA it was a high risk insurance plans for people with preexisting conditions according to freeze them it doesn't really compare\nBut it's important to recognize that it was a very limited program it covered at its peak twenty thousand people in Wisconsin and we're talking about compare that to the Affordable CARE Act and rolling two hundred thousand people in the state\nAs fluent Wisconsin taking care of people with preexisting conditions Governor Scott Walker is also highlighting his moves to pass a new law to do that I propose that we announced the law was\nConditions [noise] build did pass from the state assembly last year that prohibited exclusion of people with preexisting condition\nThe idea that has been a introduced in our state is to not far as to assure that insurance companies offer a coverage for preexisting conditions but not excluding the underwriting provision so insurance companies could offer that coverage at any price they determine\nThat is reasonable for covering that particular individuals risk and\nSo while they may get an offer of coverage that that coverage may be unattainable in terms of the price\nThe assembly bill never made it to the Senate or the governor's desk but he and his running mate are pledging to bring back legislation if something were to change a change like the repeal of the a C a in a lawsuit championed by Wisconsin Republican\nToday in Wisconsin people with preexisting conditions are already covered\nThe CIA many people don't realize affects virtually everybody who has health insurance [noise] I'm In Wisconsin even people with employer sponsored insurance that\nHappens in um several ways one of the most important ways is in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions or providing um prohibition on lifetime limits of coverage and annual limits in coverage and this again is for people even with employer sponsored insurance\nAnd insurers are bracing for potential change for example the health care plan of Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin says quote\nThe current legal efforts to invalidate the Affordable CARE Act or concerning because there are not state based back stops or federal guidance to prevent the market for reverting to pre A. C. A. conditions well Governor Walker pledges to\nChange that if the A. C. A. is repealed the temperature on last continues to rise from the race for governor down to the campaigns for US Senate\nWe're joined here now violet or white from Wisconsin Public radio and thanks for being here with us absolutely thanks for having well it does appear that this race or pivots a lock on the issue of of health care and national polling at least would seem to support\nLiving over a trillion dollar hole in our nation's budget\nWe were told that would trickle down but I haven't seen the sort of pay raises a and investments in manufacturing that I was told or you know that was that was part of uh uh what was touted and lastly with this whole in our budget now the trillion dollars\nAre people who are talking about cutting Social Security Medicare Medicaid the safety net for secure retirement for somebody who's worked hard their whole life that is absolutely unacceptable to me\nIt's a tax cuts are going to the area spring the economy and it's going to take some time for it to continue to do so um I talked to folks all across the state who are thrilled to have that extra money in their pockets to do with as they see fit for their families and that's why I advocate for these tax cuts to be permanent\nAnd I think we are going to see that the ... the economy will continue to grow not only with the tax cuts but also with the regulatory reform that the president and Congress has been enacting this is the important thing and we saw the same thing here in Wisconsin\nThe classic split between a Republican or Democrat on tax cuts um tax cuts versus a spending or service cuts uh and yet our our opinions kind of shifting on this\nYou know I guess I Do tests will be a in you know less than two months but\nThere has been some indication in public polling that\nYou know people would rather pay for services and get more tax cuts at least in state issues here in Wisconsin for example they have more money to go to schools\nThan to tax cuts are obviously we are talking about federal tax cuts here but you hear very similar arguments from Leah ... who is completely and supported tax cuts and says Tammy Baldwin\nA doesn't want to put their money back in your pocket I Do and that these are working and really this is the the big bill the Republicans were able to pass\nA during these couple of years of Republican control in Washington so makes sense that they would be talking about a ... and it's taking a the argument that Democrats took from the get go on these tax cuts that therefore the wealthy and the services you value Social Security Medicare could be cut\nNow a another big issue that affects Wisconsin as well as for the rest of the country and frankly the world are terrorists terrorists are kind of attacks by another name you've done some reporting on that\nAbsolutely and what's interesting there is that while we're seeing a very traditional Democrat and Republican message on taxes were not quite seeing that with terrorists so we're looking at is running very close to the president on the shift she says that China's been eating our lunch and we need to take action\nBut Tammy Baldwin is sort of departing from other Democrats and that she's not denouncing the terrorists as a whole\nShe's saying that it's wise to step up and tell bad actors like China that they can't continue to do what they're doing but she says the president needs to do more to target those terrorists to make sure that our trade allies aren't affected\nBecause it is a big issue as we know a in Wisconsin with all of our manufacturing in our culture as well so we move along now to our next topic\nRight up next the topic of guns and gun control\nTammy Baldwin has an F\nSo we hear first from ... Maryland we asked her whether there should be measures in place to allow taking guns from people who demonstrate danger as in so called red flag laws she speaks about a new law aimed at improving the national background check system in order to prevent felons and domestic abusers from purchasing firearms\nTammy Baldwin follows her with her support for universal checks\nThat's an area that I think needs to be investigating looked at very carefully as long as those laws are um carefully looking at a particular issues for example\nI'm fixing expelled that was done by senator core nine looked specifically at that making sure that law enforcement an individual have the information necessary when they see red flags\nWe also have to make sure we have a carefully crafted a law that looks at mental health issues because that is a significant aspect that underlies a lot of these and I'd rather look at those aspects before we start looking at taking away people's guns from them because they were in when you do that and you were taking away\nThe ability of law abiding citizens to protect themselves and that's why San so strongly with that Second Amendment right and you know have been endorsed by the IRA\nSo I'm a governor myself um and so I strongly support the second amendment but I Do not think that the second amendment precludes commonsense safety a legislation at the federal level I think we need to have a comprehensive universal background check with no loopholes for\nInternet sales or a a going to gun shows and and not having a thorough background check and then I think we have to go beyond their um there are a number of uh provisions relating to\nI'm frankly the ability to convert a semi automatic weapon into an automatic weapon with a bump stock\nAnd I think we should be considering a these enormous magazines that had a allow a so many um shots to be fired or those aren't needed for those are weapons of war basically on our streets and we've got to step up\nOn this issue a little less recall the ... first a campaign ads featured her with a gun at\nHer side and a bunch of ... is kind of laying on the ads for the homeless veterans hospital opioid controversy and the death of a veteran there of an overdose in those that she blames Tammy Baldwin\nA four fold wins part she did discipline top aides over her offices response to that uh she also I'm released an ad describing her own mother struggled with addiction so these are some of the other kinds of issues that are coming out in the U.S Senate race in Wisconsin [noise]\nIt seems like election cycle after election cycle um there are people saying maybe this will be the year that that the gun issue or gun control is kind of a centerpiece of the campaigns are we're going to talk about for the next you know a couple of years\nUm I mean we had mass shootings or in in the past couple of years that have really energized younger voters for example to the issue is very much I'm In front of people but in in ... when it comes to campaigns\nA general election campaigns you do see is sort of tend to feed off into the distance and something like ... of the the VA\nBecomes something that we've opened wants to highlight in Tammy Baldwin feels the need to you know step in and kind of to go to a ground to [noise]\nWhat do you think um over the next to fewer than six weeks we should be expecting in this race\nAt ... scandal and I can hear about something that's related to the ... scandal the opioid epidemic I think both women on TALK frequently about their different ideas for combating the opioid epidemic in Wisconsin that's something that will continue to say\nAnd I think that will continue to see them getting very personal we've seen that from live oak marrying her first ad sort of introducing herself to voters and are seen that in a new way from can evolve and this time that we really hadn't from her in the past where she's talking about her past her mother's addiction when she was growing up\nAnd things like that All right well I think we leave it there and we thank you very much for all for joining us on that have had and finally tonight another election special live on the horizon October twelve that's when Sean and I will call moderate a debate between the candidates running for attorney general\nIncome and candidate Republican Brad shovel and democratic challenger Josh call will be here for a one hour lived to be from seven thirty to eight thirty pm on Wisconsin Public television and radio that is friday night\nOctober twelve I'm front of

police officer who responded to disorderly subject at a retail store and recognize that this was a woman who was on the autism scale and instead of using handcuffs he\nHe settled her down got the problem resolve even got out his own wallet and bought the item that her caregiver wasn't able to buy for her that day those people are in these challenge coins just yesterday I was with our Wisconsin state patrol\nUm for their annual awards ceremony I got to be as a speaker at that and uh some challenge quaint or is there included a state trooper Eddie Portage city officer who jumped into a river risking their own life to rescue someone who was caught in the rushing waters\nChat law enforcement officers and our military don't consider these fake coins he's a big deal to them and it's important that we we support them in these difficult times\nTo call 'em why is this something that you've been highlighting a as a campaign for\nThere's no question first of all that our law enforcement officers do some amazing work as I mentioned in the opening I'm proud that my step dad bill was a police officer\nIn you know um but our attorney general has spent about eighty three thousand dollars of taxpayer money on promotional materials that includes a these fake gold plated coins with his name on them\nAnd while ... may be appropriate to use your campaign funds on I'm Mr shall use taxpayer dollars and he put his name on the coins as well as his motto um but money has also been spent on promotional stress balls\nOn money has been spent on custom made fortune cookies which I didn't even know it was the thing that existed until I learned about them in this campaign a and in the meantime\nI Will that money was spent only nine of the kids in our backlog of untested rape kits were tested in Mr ... first two years in office to me that is a definition of misplaced priorities the\nTwo things are completely unrelated we got the largest grants in America for the sexual assault kit testing because of the plan we put together that the U.S department of justice believe was the best there was the ... the other promotional materials\nFrankly when I got to the OJ ... those things are being purchased I don't monitor every purchase that happened we discovered this was happening we clamped down on it we reduce the thresholds for people being able to purchase those things and it's not happening anymore\nBut the challenge coins that's a separate issue from the other promotional items along to our next\nQuestion yeah you're both on opposite sides of a lawsuit involving voting laws in Wisconsin judge call you literally argued the case in court or against attorneys from the Wisconsin department of justice this case reinstated several weeks of early voting or in person absentee voting in Wisconsin It's still on a ...\nHere why did you bring this lawsuit Josh call in ... why is it a case you're fighting so first you Josh call\n'em there have been several restrictions on voting\nThat have been an active in Wisconsin um there were over a dozen enacted and Scott Walker's first term in office\nThere's also a law that limited early voting to one location permanent ... no matter how big them innocent ... he was\nAnd as you can imagine that played out somewhat differently in Milwaukee as compared to say fond du Lac I'm so we went to court or we had a trial in front of a federal judge that lasted nearly two weeks I'm my team went up against a team from the department of justice led by\nMr ... and I'm proud that we won a significant victory in that case several restrictions on voting were struck down as a result um that included some restrictions on voter registration that were struck down\nAnd it also included restrictions on early voting that were struck down I'm as a result of that case um early voting has begun in parts of Wisconsin right now I'm I'm Glad that people are able to vote early right now and I'm proud of that case\n... why is this a case that you're fighting\nBecause it's my job as attorney in general I don't pick and choose which law I defend or not\nMy opponent talks about he likes this law he would defend is this other law he doesn't like and he's less reluctant is more reluctant to defend that that's not what you do I've defended laws that I don't like in fact we took one law that I'm not a fan of all the way to Ninety state Supreme Court and won\nFortunately the legislature has since changed that law on 'em and fix a problem with Wisconsin law but\nThat's not my job to decide that the legislature passes a law as the attorney general if we are to have a stable and predictable legal and regulatory environment in our state we have to have an attorney general who won't be an activist who won't pick and choose which lost a defense\nNow we have two roles one is we advise our climate client and that's the state of Wisconsin it could be the governor could be the legislature or regulatory agencies we advise them and then we also defend in court\nWe also provided advice to ah to the governor's office as they put administrative rules in place to\nTo make sure voter id was was handled in a way that was constitutional and they put in place methods that made this very similar to what Indiana did and that's already been approved by the United States Supreme court\nOrder to follow up on on that element of loss you real quick to the the voter id element of this or that that lawsuit sought to strike that down a court of appeals to put that part of the ruling on hold\nWhy shouldn't Wisconsin voters have to show a photo ID when they vote again for Steve Josh call\nThere are a couple of problems with this law one is um we were able to show in that case a that approximately a hundred people had gone through the process of trying to get a free id\nAnd we're not able to get an ID so in early twenties sixteen or some people actually disenfranchised or Mr ... office argue that that issue um should have been pushed down the road but fortunately it moves fast and are there is now a process in place that helps people do it but we also were able to show\nThat at the final Republican Senate caucus meeting before the voter id law was enacted a there were statements indicating that the law was being an active because of its effect on college campuses and in communities in Milwaukee\nAlright ... I'm a same question when it comes to voter id why is this something that you are defending\nOf the advice we provided to our client made sure that when people want the department of motor vehicles if we couldn't prove they were not entitled to an id to vote they got the ID so there's a time limit at the department of motor vehicle\nThe idea if they can't do it you get an idea that an eight that permits you to vote that's that's good for Wisconsin in it's good for voter integrity and it makes sure that no one loses their precious right to vote\nAnd move on to our next question as the U.S Supreme Court as you know has an associate justice on the bench describe how the contentious process to confirmed Brett Kavanaugh that saw accusations and in aisles effect victim writes in your mind how did the contentious process effect victims that's cause for San Fran channel\nMy opponents never worked with a sexual assault survivor I worked with hundreds of them\nI was I volunteered to join the sensitive crimes you know walk shut da's office they rolled it varies you prosecutors will take on because it's very difficult challenging work emotionally and legally I did that work for for over a decade and beyond that\nOnce I started doing that work for a few years I began to be recognized as an expert and I became involved in providing\nUm training on trauma informed investigations to thousands of law enforcement officers prosecutors and victim advocates around the state of Wisconsin and we began making our criminal justice system a more welcoming place for survivors of sexual assault\nI'm proud of that work and I continued at the department of justice to do that with placing five violence against women up prosecutors around the state of Wisconsin is resource prosecutors to the days and law enforcement fight and thing up these same nurse program they talked about the sexual assault nurse examiner program that's now making it\nEasier for sexual assault victims to come forward\nUm we're doing all those things\nIf the criticisms that some have levied about uh about my work at the department of justice for true I wouldn't have the vast majority Ninety percent of the elected sheriff in ... Wisconsin endorsing me their doors for me because they know I had the experience they've seen the results and that's why I'm law enforcement's choice of the question\nTo you\nJosh call how did that process of a confirmation for a prank Kavanaugh effect victims in your mind\n... I think the process was not a good one I think that Dr lousy Ford is courageous for coming forward and I have a different view on this process from Mr ...\nUm she suggested that he didn't know whether something that happened\nThirty six years ago should prevent somebody from ever serving on the Supreme Court um I think that our chief law enforcement officer needs to do that if a a sexual assaults happens thirty six years ago\nThe person involved is disqualified from serving on the United States Supreme court\nHe also suggested that this process would prevent survivors from coming forward but actually the opposite has happened a number of people coming forward has increased um I think we need an A. G. who's going to make clear that he is on the side of survivors who are coming forward\nUh unfortunately from Mr Schumer we've seen a a pattern of this sort of thing I touched on before\nThe backlog of untested rape kits were only nine kids were tested in his first two years in office but also when Mr ... was a prosecutor in Waukesha county I'm In one case I Believe", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "13"}
