into an already red hot political environment with the discovery of pipe bomb sent to seven apparent targets rock Obama Hillary Clinton former attorney general Eric Holder\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz former CIA director John Brennan and CNN\nThis comes after what happened on Monday when democratic donors George Soros was also a target of one of these devices we don't know who is responsible yet\nSo we're going to take a take a breath tonight talked about what we know how we got here and what it means for the election in our society and we want to hear from you\nHere's our question tonight what do you tell your children about our politics\nHave you talked about today's news give us a call at eight four four seven four or five talk that's eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five is always you can send us a tweet using the hash tag a O T L we always start off with the latest news and the very latest is that President Trump is campaigning in Wisconsin\nIn Wisconsin this evening for a Governor Scott Walker who is in a very tough reelection race and for live ... who is challenging democratic senator\nTammy Baldwin and what we're interested to see is whether President Trump includes the kind of language he's employed in his other rallies calling out reporters as quote fake news taunting Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and well you know the rest will see in a while\nAn earlier today in the White House the president called for unity\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nWe have to stress that we don't know who sent these bombs we do know that they were sent to regular targets of some right wing activists and politicians including the president\nSomeone the writer saying it safe a left wing ... perpetrator trying to set up a quote false flag situation to make the right look bad so close to the election\nAnd the timing of this does complicate everything what will be the impact of this attempt to terror will have a positive effect rats at the noise level back to maybe a five instead of where it is now or are we so tribal now that we risk making our divisions worse\nLots of questions so let's look for some answers together from some people who know the landscape better than most joining us from Milwaukee Charlie Sykes conservative writer podcaster and author of how the right lost its mind\nHere with me in New York shown waltz national affairs correspondent for the nation and the CNN contributor and in Washington White House reporter April Ryan of the American urban radio networks all welcome to America on the line April I'm welcome\nOn America on the line\nAnd thank you for having me on such a terrible day\nYes Charlie let me let me ask you start with you by asking has the president started speaking yet he was scheduled to start speaking at seven thirty pm eastern but last I check he had not taken the podium\nNo he he did start speaking a little while ago and he said do we will find those responsible we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly and then he said political violence as an attack on our democracy itself so he followed up the rhetoric we heard from the White House but obviously\nA couple of scripted remarks are really don't change the political context of the moment we're in the\nKnow in April is someone who sits in the White House press briefing room whose band that to to rally is like the one that the president is speaking to right now uh I\nI Would love to get your your um observations your reactions of what that experience is like as a reporter\nSo Jonathan rallies are generally um interesting to watch\nUh the rise and fall of the enthusiasm or the continual wise or what have you it it's almost like I'm going to church\nWhere you have the person there who feel the crowd cheered when they're supposed to and and fall down with his coach and listen to them and cheer when they are supposed to these rallies or something totally different and and just to correct the record I have never been to a Trump rally and I am\nIt is not safe for me to attend a Trump rally at this point because I Am\nConsidered a target um by some of those who follow the president\nUm and have had my own death threat um but what I Will tell you is is that this president I'm In his speech that hurt a little bit of the four jumped on the line with you he um he has to continue what he said this morning\nAnd it's happening to the question is can you change the tone of what he's already started and and the belief ability ... of this because\nAs I watch today and I'm sure you picked up on it as well with your king inside\nWe watched the president's head and and then his his a staff jumped up right away\nBut it took a while for the the rest of the room to follow suit and give a standing ovation and when you talk so vehemently and and and have fully towards groups people be it the Democrats who a mob beat reporters who are um\nUh on American or or opposition party or in these other people and whatever and talking about you know body slamming a reporter and congratulated met and then changing your speak it\nHas to be persuasive not just today he's got to sustain that because this is so dangerous now in a dangerous period and he's calling for unity he's got to continue now the question is will his supporters believe him you know and right and if he and it's something that the change has got to count\nMy joined you um and I apologize April for a mistake that you'd been to Trump rallies with Joan has been to Trump rallies and Joan ... also as journalists ... um give your observations of what it's like to be a journalist that a Trump rally\nI haven't been since twenty sixteen but that was scary as scary enough Jonathan I mean you were in a

I Wonder if I Want to thank you for calling in and especially thank you for that single for that single minded as a special residents were me today because I saw\nA American Sign on Broadway sarin Kerry Washington and that is a central theme in that that Ninety minutes play so thank you very much ... in St Louis thank you for calling into America on the line\n[laughter] thank you for having my call though yes I'm just sitting here listening to your radio station and it just hit me that this is what we talked about today I'm a high school teacher and we were just talking about the news and I say hey did you guys listen to the cabinet all a\nConfirmation and none of them knew I was talking about because kids today love their cell phones when they're not looking at the news I explain to them what's going on I said this man\nWho is a judge who was really doing a job interview\nWas being very disrespectful to those who were interviewing him and they still confirmed him to a job that's for the rest of his life so they were like how do you get up there with your life I'm like well that's what they have Supreme Court justice\nSo I'm I Am asking my students if you don't like the way that going maybe should get into politics and try to change that a person can't sit on a job from the Nineteen fifties twenty Eighteen [laughter] you know the world has changed so drastically and the last almost a year I'd\nStill go by\n... at least I I I Do want to thank you thank you for your call and thank you for calling in from from St Louis I Do need to move on to to our panel as the clock ticks down and want to get into the political climate a little more deeply now joining me from Washington is Peter Wehner\nWho is a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center and a former advisor to the last three Republican administrations and here with me in Studio in New York Karen Greenberg who is director of the center for national security along with John walls\nThe nation Peter let me start with you and we have Sarah who um ministers out there in Ohio you're in the evangelical Christian you often write about religion and politics do you worry about the tribalism that that divides the\nOh yeah I think that the tribalism than America that is one of the chief some problems that um that we face so I mean this is always been to some extent troubles to country a polarized country that is true every I'm Free country but it's it's\nThey all look that I can call in my lifetime and uh and uh you know people are living in in different worlds I'm and the demonization of American politics is what's striking to me um you know you get the sense of people\nLook across the divide and you don't just disagreed with each other but they think the other person those militias shovel level and\nThen the rhetoric issue is really getting out of out of control and at some point or the rhetoric is out of control of the ... to um to uh to ... [laughter]\nSo we're ... who's the worst pods equals country when the ... or ... sixty eight other periods but this is a difficult\nMoment [noise] and uh things are getting worse not better and so a lot of the stale smell\nRight caring to pick up on that 'cause I was going to ask you it seems like we're in darker times in our politics are we in darker times in in our politics yes\nBut I Want to just pick up on something that um he was saying which is that it's easy to say tribalism but one of the things that I think it's really interesting that's happening in the country and that's pushing us into darker times is that\nThere is we keep talking about these young individuals that are prone to violence to go to violence or or your earlier caller that called in about her four children and her daughter being labeled a certain way right what we see all around us is this profound identity crisis on a very personal level\nIndividuals trying to figure out how do I identify themselves how to re identify themselves how to question their identity whether it's gender religion whatever it is\nNow we see a country that's having an identity crisis\nAnd so it seems to me this is sort of bubbling up from the personal to the larger the here and now to the to the very highest\nUm office is in the land and so I I think we need to understand it that way which doesn't minimize that the tribalism but adds a layer to what I actually think it is going on that we need to grapple with are we at a given what\nWe're I'm following today um the pipe bombs and to set in um people and entities entities meaning CNN or are we added to it I mean are we at a tipping point moment for or am I just being hyperbolic or why\nDon't you know you know I don't think we know we're at a tipping point moment until we tip right when we look back in history um and I\nYou know I I basically agree with what Peter said but I guess I Would take a little bit [noise]\nI Would push back a little bit on the word tribalism because it really does it's another one of those words that kind of has a connotation of both sides and I think Peter would agree with me that one side has really gone off the deep end in the last thirty\nWalls Peter Winter Karen Greenberg thank you very much for being on America on the line we'll take a break here and when we return we'll turn our attention back to the campaign trail in battleground Arizona [noise]\n\nYou're listening to America on the line from WNYC as it happens returns in its entirety on friday November second\nComing from the television has an all hidden channels that in the plane to learn and grow and have fun while they are they and then the ... channel I mean all the time quality educational television children now and love twenty four hours a day that's a nice stream curious George and\nDaniel tigers neighborhood\nThat's going to see them you can watch them over the air or seen them anytime anywhere\nSupport for WPRI comes from a I a Wisconsin the state's side of the of the American Institute of architects dedicated to creating practical solutions and building better communities with a focus on sustainable outcomes\nWisconsin an architect dot org Wisconsin Public radio brings you thoughtful and engaging discussions everyday authors artists politicians and voices from around the state you hear them all and you can be part of the conversation too on air or online at WPRI dot org\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n[laughter]\nJonathan Capehart and this is America on the line from WNYC in public radio stations across the country\nAnd we're going to go across the country to Arizona for another report from the campaign trail this one is a very tight race between two women to replace Republican Senator Jeff flake\nJoining me now for an update on that and the messaging battle over who will protect Arizona and health care is Kevin ... political reporter for her post Kevin welcome back to America on the line\n... and also we'll be taking your calls in this segment to specifically we want to hear from you if health care is your main issue in this election and if so why call us at eight four four seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nKevin ... or the Senate race in Arizona is particularly interesting because no matter who wins the Democrat um which is ...\nCinema board the Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally there will be a woman going to the Senate from Arizona I'm next year so we're and go ahead Kevin\nOh yeah and they'll be the first female senator from the state of Arizona the winter\nUh this is something that's been coming up a little bit more and more as more women have run for office we started to see more women versus warm in Senate races uh there was one last year in New Hampshire\nA this is one of two this year the other one is in Wisconsin a there is also well I should say one of three of the Nebraska Senate race which isn't particularly competitive also has two female candidates while we're starting to see more and more a woman versus warm and Senate races which were extremely uncommon obviously for 'em much of the twentieth century now\nThe gaps in the polls between the two of them has widened recently with five thirty eight giving cinema as sixty three percent chance of winning so ... what do you think is cinema pulling away or is this still a tight race\nThis is still a very tight race cinema is probably a slight favorite um she has a lead in some polls are the political environment also favors are slightly a but it's not a huge margin in this race it would not shocked me at all if Nick Sally pulled us out\nHuh [laughter] and so the other thing the other historic thing here in this race is that if Crist in cinema wins as he is the is the first openly bisexual she would be the first openly bisexual\nI'm senator from Arizona from anywhere in the country and she would be only the second openly L G Beatty senator in the country of course after senator\nTammy Baldwin from Wisconsin how our next Sally and send them a um framing gender in their in their campaigns is one running towards it and the other one running away from it\nIt's interesting it really doesn't come up that much considering that this is a contest putting two women against each other um there is a gender gap in public polling that favors cinema uh you would expect that typically I'm female voters favor Democrats or that situation doesn't necessarily change when both\nCandidates are female and actually in some cases when both candidates are female the gender gap actually gets bigger in favor of Democrats\nOr we haven't quite seen that here but neither candidate is necessarily running on you know elect me and I'll be the first woman in part because they're both women\nAlthough both candidates do I'm sort of emphasize I'm sort of some of the historic nature of their candidacies are of their lives um Mick Sally we'll talk frequently about how she was the first woman in the U.S military to fly during combat um after the\nProhibition on women flying in combat was lifted in the early nineties she flew 'em in Desert Storm and after a and then sort of the Afghanistan conflict\nFight following the September eleventh attacks cinema I'm also isn't really wants to play up her gender\nUm but she is clearly you know she emphasizes parts of her background as an algae beauty person she played a large role in defeating two propositions that would've banned same sex marriage in Arizona a when she was a state legislator state legislator\nA and but she doesn't really play up the fact that she would be the first uh openly bisexual senator doesn't really talk about the fact that she would be a\nOne of only to uh open the algae team members of members of the Senate and neither does make Sally it's really a and this may be a former progress it's really not an issue at all\nNow when you were on the show a little while back it's been that the whole segment talking about the importance of of education as an issue there in Arizona but apparently healthcare is a dominant issue in in Arizona isn't it\nIn the Senate race I was just at an event cinema was actually holding with a group of teachers it was a a canvas kick off to basically encourage the teachers you know go out and knock on doors for her campaigns and the vice president of the Arizona Education Association the teachers the major teachers' union here\nWas there and even she said that health care was sort of the dominant in the race more so than education it's really become the dominant issue because cinema like so many other Democrats around the country has just been hammering\nMix Sally over a Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare and what that would have done if they had been successful to the protections for people with preexisting conditions\nIn the Obamacare law we've also seen mix Sally this morning a came up with an ad where she claims that she would have that she would protect people with preexisting conditions and they've been fighting the insurance companies\nThat's not really backed up by her votes on Obamacare repeal a experts and industry groups and advocacy groups all agree that the protections for people in ... with preexisting conditions\nIn the GOP plan to replace Obamacare would have been much much weaker than the ones that are included in the Obamacare law\nNow ... is a congresswoman cinema hammering congresswoman mix Sally over the report where mix Sally was quoted as saying an excuse me at a Republican caucus lunch the report I read said she stood up and said quote let's get this ... thing done\nAbout about the repeal efforts on the part of the Republican Party\nYeah I mean that specifically hasn't come up with that did show you know mix Ali was all in on these proposals a there is not a lot of hesitancy on her part the way there was some other um\nRepublicans running in spring district and a lot of Republicans running in spring districts that he's a number of them ended up not voting for the law\nA mix Sally at that time had an yet declared her candidacy for center at the time a Senator Jeff flake we're still expected to run for reelection but she is a she was represented a swing district in Congress ... a district that narrowly voted for Hillary Clinton and she was still very enthusiastic about repeal at the time\nWhy asked folks to call if they if health care was a main issue for them in this election as folks to call it for for seven four or five eight to five five and Donna from Everett, Washington\nAh heeded the call Donna as always welcome to America on the line\nThank you for having me so health care is an important issue for you in this election\nYeah for some reason I say that I have created their own children and elderly parents ... thing condition children\nElderly parents and there's a lot of reasons to want health care I'm from Washington we used to have state health care plan but for the amount of care system came in I like that just a very large and travel I handled Obamacare is I Am the profit\nI end paying someone else's retirement plans someone else's\nMoney for their second home ... or send their kids to the college instead of keeping profit nine and my ... and I walk I don't think it's right for government to require that I make profit industry we should
