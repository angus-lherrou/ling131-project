Associated Press national politics reporter Hi Lisa thanks for coming on welcome to America on the line\nHi Brian thanks for having me so\nThis just broke a couple of hours ago and it was from an AP interview right how the president is comparing Saudi Arabia to Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's right our White House reporters did sit down with the president just a little while ago and we have a number of stories coming out this evening from that interview one advantage says posted online now in circulating and he said you know the president has really been I'm leaning into this idea of\nGiving Saudi Arabia some distance from NASA a case that they've seen journalist and he told the report very fair and the interview he said quote you know I think we have to find out what happened first and here we go again with you now you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that he said\nWe just went through that with justice cabin on us and the than all the way he's really can Harry and Saudi Arabia\nAnd whether or not they on a conference and the government there Saudi Arabia of life at all\nI'm involved in the disappearance have come off the show they have the yeah that's right the end colonel asked to have gone in to the consulate faring just involved and never return dad and he um the president is Israelis sort of I'm questioning\nWhether or not the government was even involved we of course have multiple reports uh now you know indicating that they're there may have been involved there and it is something that is of course a massive investigation right now\nIn Turkey I stay uncover what happened two weeks ago when journalists went into the consulate\nCurrent tell us a little bit about what's been shaping up in that investigation today because with Kevin uh one could argue certainly as supporters argue that there was some evidence but it was far from conclusive regarding ... Ford how's the evidence been shaping up\nEspecially today for people who may not have been following the news during business hours regarding the disappearance of Washington Post columnist ...\nYeah I mean these are just really two very different cases and to sort of conflate them as the president has\nJust it's just it's it's just a different line of a sort of thinking then\nThen the way a lot of people are thinking of the situation of course the situation with the charge happened you know allegedly thirty five years ago in this situation here with the Saudi ... a writer it unfolding before our very eyes so I'm the ape you have to report out of stumble\nTonight that says that you know the police are searching the Saudi a consulate there and I'm I'm believe they have found um you know some evidence that he was in fact\nKilled there and they are continuing the investigation and so you know there is um a lot of pressure right now on Saudi Arabia\nTo explain what happened you know consulate is that you know it's a government building it's where you go to ... do you know official this tend to have the status than someone who is of the country going to you know their home state building there in a foreign country and have them disappeared is you know very\nUnusual and so you know why was the country um\nI you know are apt to unable to um protect a\nYou know the journalist and in that country it just raises enormous amounts of questions and of course you have the Republican senators here in Congress which is you know where I'm\nAt covering Capitol Hill I'm a\nVoting offices let me let me jump in on that because\nWe have a clip of just what you are starting to refer to and here's one place where the comparison between tub and all and the Saudis\nCertainly breaks down Kavanaugh had Senator Lindsey Graham fiercely in his corner on this question of guilty until proven innocent he was Lindsey Graham today on Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman who groom refers to\nHere as in the U.S there's a difference between a country an individual thing NBS figure there's to me toxic he can never\nBe a world leader on the world to what is the president do thank us up to the ... what I Would do I know what I'm going to do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia\nSo ones from the defense of the Saudis want even his own party in Congress has not\nYet you know um I I Can't answer that fully you know I think the country a United States and Saudi Arabia have long and deep ties of course Saudi Arabia was the first stop foreign visit that President Trump made in twenty Seventeen after he took office\nSo [noise] um there's been a relationship there for a very long time between these countries in the relationship or have any turbulence in the relationship obviously [noise] um it's difficult but that's exactly what you're seeing and this division as you mentioned between\nUm the senators I'm Lindsey Graham of course being the most outspoken but you know a number of senators\nI came out last week I signed on to a letter I'm sort of starting the clock on these sanctions that um could could happen could it could be fall on on Saudi Arabia [noise]\nI'm In a hundred and twenty day clock that the Senate started um [noise] um and the president will have to respond to that and decide whether or not to um a whole Saudi Arabia accountable 'em and see you know what what\nInvestigation um I\nI Want to say it was a sweeping a quick action by the Senate here for the it was almost unanimously by the U.S senators on the Foreign Relations committee to [noise]\nTo launch that I'm a hundred and twenty days sanctions clock which you know you rarely see that kind of cooperation anymore here on Capitol Hill right and so it was a real indication that\nI'm the president is it that out on his own on this of course secretary pale Mike Pompeo the secretary of state\nWent over to Saudi Arabia today um and his meeting with NBS I'm Robin and solemn um on on the issue I'm a ... and and so we'll see you know where the investigation goes um\nYes it is a bit isolated on this\nIs my guest is Lisa ... from the Associated Press the a P interview with the president was today was leading the day that it\nWas just a a I think are the stories are just posting here within the last hour or so it was in the afternoon as a as far as I Know a\nLot of it a little bit to track of time you know maybe a couple of hours ago yeah\n'cause uh I guess up until the ... know lifted scheduled today and he seems to have spent the day tweeting or were you counting I Know some of the media was counting I think they were up to Seventeen and mid afternoon or something like that which is high even for him\nYeah you know it was a I think surprising to a lot of people you know when that schedule comes out usually the night before we get a sense of what the president's during again I'm up here on Capitol Hill so I don't follow 'em\nAs closely as our White House team does but I definitely noticed it last night when it came over right that there was nothing on his schedule now clearly he had this interview with the Associated Press I imagine\nHe's doing you know other calls and other events during the day that are not on his schedule but you're absolutely right he started the day treating and he has been treating quite a bit during the course of the day I did not some of the total ... got her\nThat we saw um you know treats about I'm Elizabeth Warren the senator who has been talking about her um you know Native American ancestry it's an issue she's been a wrestling when we saw some treats on the Russia investigation\nWe will kind of go down that gas lighting we'll do you feel you've been gas let the Trump your and your mental health David Greenberg

mid term elections we'll talk now about how the steady stream of rough and tumble news about politics and the increasing tenuous relationship of things that are said to be fat and truth\nIs affecting many of us in somewhat less than clinical terms the news is making it was crazy so we brought in an expert Dr Cindy bound Baker a clinical psychologist who is joining us from Philadelphia\nAnd her take us neither political nor predictable she's got so many scenarios of individuals from left right and other working through their feelings about the country today in various ways couples to so welcome Dr bound Baker\nThank you very much glad to be here and listeners will take your calls at eight four four seven four or five talk is the news or the political environment being reported on by news outlets stressing you out how are you dealing with it are you cutting back on news\nAre you watching more news I think we'll hear his story of that as a way to cope\nFrom our guest house or you're dealing with it how can your experiences help your fellow listeners to cope with what questions might you have for a doctor Ben Baker aid for for seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five eight four or five eight four four I'll just\nSeven four or five talk\nUm you have so many interesting scenarios let's run a few before run through a few before we take some calls from listeners\nI'm One of the stories you told us off the air is one member of spousal unit is anxious so she's wanting to watch the news all the time the husband just turned off by that because watching the news is making him anxious can you talk about that couple in what they represent\n[noise] yes sure um you know anxiety management is been really a challenge for a number of people\nAnd we all manage her anxiety differently so for some people the more information they get the more they can reduce their anxiety and for other people the more information they get the more their anxiety ratchet up\nAnd the problem happens when you have a couple\nA where one wants to be listening to the news and watching TV all the time\nSo that his anxiety can uh be lessened and his wife is somebody who when she sees Donald Trump or hears news starts getting more and more anxious so\nIt's affected couples it's affected individuals I\nI Want to piggyback on something David said sure\nDavid said um you know you asked them about gas lighting and do people only believe you know when the president tells them they haven't seen what they know they've seen and I would say he's not making us crazy but he's crazy making\nAnd it's in the crazy making\nThat people are having difficulty\nIf you if you think of anxiety right how anxiety as a felt sense of no control and unpredictable future a feeling of no escape\nAnd when people have that sense\nAnd if they start worrying and worrying worrying they can we called ruminate are worried they're way down to depression and we of course depression is also the stuff I've lost so these are the things I mean I can give you a some clinical scenarios and these are some of the things people are talking about a lot in my office\nSo let me ask you how you would resolve the first scenario um that you laid out where you have one spouse who wants to watch the news a lot to reduce her anxiety but watching the news makes the husband more anxious how would you counsel a couple like that\nIn a case like that um she's gonna have to be watching or she is going to be have to be watching the news um when she's not in the bedroom or in the living room um and it's a reduction in their shared time\nI'm a you know it's the the best way to do it I'm there I had one couple that just decided that the bedroom was off limits\nFor the news and um they sort of you know like we do with little kids and we say there are certain rules that you can bring your toys in in certain rooms to camp there are certain rooms in this house you can listen to the news and certain ones you can\nLet me raise one other scenario of yours for listeners before we go to our phone call is um and this really crosses\nParty lines is is not about you taking a political position any is er and so you've talked about how many Democrats are feeling betrayed and handing by their represent\nShould open their mouth and say this is crazy but many Republicans are feeling Shandong rejected and wounded and not understood and they're feeling even silence because so many Democrats are feeling this rage can you compare and contrast\nWell you know everybody's pain of course has their own pain I think that if I'm as somebody who works with a couples as well as individuals with couples oftentimes it's helping one understand the other the communication here each other more I think the issues run deeper now in the divide\nI think that um as you say Democrats are feeling really betrayed and Republicans are feeling so rejected and miss understood\nUm and nobody's trusting anybody so when we're we're living in two worlds right we're listening to two different news that's even the word I don't know [laughter] I'm old enough yet is now um and we're told the press is the enemy of the state\nSo then\nWho can be trusted so people aren't trusting each other and with how a sense of trust\nYou know our whole socio emotional world becomes a very dangerous place\nAnd you see an outgrowth in this in a sort of sense of paranoia [noise] um and and you see this and the object of xenophobia and what's happening with the immigrant families in separating the kids and people intensity is terrible or Charlottesville is a\nYou know an example of that so [noise]\nA lot of people certainly in certain demographic feel unsafe\nAnd I think there's something else that the president's styles\nIs one um that's really I'm filled with a lot of uncertainty it's always a changing landscape right change change change change\n'em and that's hard for people and that scares us because it's unpredictable if you go back to when I said about anxiety and so what the president has done is he creates a lot of chaos and uncertainty and then he tells people\nThat I Will make America great again and if you just listen to me that other stuff it's fake news it's baloney those you know blah blah blah listened to me people are holding onto that because they're scared I think everyone is scared\nLet's take a phone call poll in St Louis you're on America on the line I fall scarred\nMedia can be both isolating and community forum and we have to take a break we'll
