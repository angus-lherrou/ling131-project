P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n\n[noise] from WNYC radio I'm Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line on news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations around the country\nWhere here every Monday through Thursday was the latest developments analysis and your calls our question tonight is especially intriguing and we'll get to that and just a few minutes\nWith election day exactly one week away there's a lot of campaign news to cover let's start with the United States Constitution the fourteenth amendment to be specific last night in an interview with Jonathan swam from actually does President Trump said he would sign an executive order\nTo end what's known as birthright citizenship which gives every person born in the United states automatic citizenship\nSome legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution we could have water ... or have you thought about that yes that we've all it was always told me that you need is a constitutional amendment guessing lemon but\nYou don't need a number one number one you don't do that somebody can nothing to worry about it as well and you can definitely go with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nJoining me to talk about the legal aspect of this if WNYC legal affairs correspondent Jamie Floyd Jamie welcome to welcome back to America on the line okay Jamie your legal expert\nIs what the president proposes even legal or constitutional\nWell uh I have my pocket constitutions you're wearing writers certainly wish the president would open has so let's just simply read the constitution and we only need to read the fourteenth amendment section one and Jonathan don't worry it'll take\nJust one second to read the relevant portion it's very explicit it's the citizenship clause the very first words if the fourteenth amendment ratified right after the civil war\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside so what does that mean Jonathan it is simple\nChildren born in the U.S automatically become citizens of the U.S and so any executive order to change this would lead to an immediate constitutional debate over the fourteenth amendment and I've been thinking about this all day Jonathan\nI and my view and and the view it seems a of a broad swath of analyst in scholars today is that the fourteenth amendment citizenship guarantee is clear\nAnd that the president cannot erase it or really any other part of the constitution with an executive order that's the very foundation of our constitutional form of\nGovernment Jamie Kennedy just provide some context why was the fourteenth amendment even necessary why was that cause you read even necessary that is\nImportant to understand the main purpose of this clause was to overrule the now infamous Dred Scott decision of the U.S Supreme Court which was handed down an Eighteen fifty seven and that said Jon I than ... as he ...\nDoes not know this part of our history but it said that black slaves were property and that we were specifically Jonathan not\nCitizens and plus the decision also said that Congress and the states could not grant citizenship to the descendants of slaves including the children all freed slaves\nThey were not us citizens either and so this is why what has happened today is so painful\nA it is rooted in the ugly history of this country and the Dred Scott ruling was specifically nullified in sixteen fifty eight when the U.S ratified the fourteenth amendment which is essentially gave blacks\nThe right to US citizenship and all persons born on this soil\nI wouldn't even ask you a question about just let's say he was the president was able to actually do this the logistical nightmare of of enforcing that I mean what he's proposing in the end is just kabuki theater there's this is going nowhere\nWell the politics of citizenship goes back a century or more citizenship it's been a contested political issue\nSince reconstruction uh and and the president understands that you're asking me the legal part of this I can dive into the political if you want to do that now I you know coming today a days before the election it sounds more like a political stunt than any sort of reasoned argument\nBut given the ugly history um I\nI think we have to think both about the legal kabuki theater as you\nA college and the political implications of what he's trying to do and you as you recall Jonathan\nUh he he brought this up once before and two in two thousand six election there was all this talk about the executive order a ... around the citizenship question and then nothing came of it until when today brings it up again\nA and there's an expectation that after the midterm elections it will it will disappear right well I have you here real quickly and um forgive me if I neglected to even bring this up as as a topic but I'm the president also an announced yesterday that he wants to send\nFifty two hundred troops to the border to help block migrants making slowly making their way up from Central America and that last\nUm read out they were over a thousand miles away from the U.S border with Mexico just legal migrants right the migrants legally speaking\nWhat can troops do in the military do in terms of enforcing the law on the border\nRight well ... there he this has come up before with President Trump\nA and watch authorities he has to give orders a release of the the us border\nUh and the military and which are aspects of our ah for the U.S military forces border patrol et cetera should be monitoring the border by the way before the migrants have even approached the border\nUh so it's it's terribly complicated and again days before the election so let's have this conversation shall we after the election and see whether he's still talking about sending anyone to the border beyond the folks who are they are monitoring the border and part of their daily job all ready\nSo Jayme our taxpayer dollars herself on the show eight days from now [laughter] oh I just made you an idea [laughter] that is great well Jamie a thank you very much Jamie Floyd WNYC legal affairs\nOur panel for tonight joining us is Washington Post columnist Council on Foreign Relations fellow\nConservative and author of the new book the corrosion of conservatism Max Boot and with me also here in the studio is Brian layer host of WNYC ease the Brian Lehrer show max Brian welcome to the show hey Johnathan I to be on okay I I Want to since I was talking with Jamie about um\nI Am this executive order on the fourteenth amendment ... let's just have to have had this discussion before we we turn to Pittsburgh Brian sincere here um your your reactions to this\n[noise] well there's a lot to say and Jamie shed a lot of what needs to be said one\nOther thing is that this a clause of the constitution as it relates to immigrants was actually tested\nIn the U.S Supreme Court a few decades later when\nChinese immigrants exclusion was all the rage in the United states like Latino and Muslim exclusion is now in certain circles and there was a Chinese American born in this country name long cam arc\nWho left the country and to test\nWhether this applied to immigrants um he was detained outside of San Francisco and he tried to come back\nAnd just went to the Supreme Court and they said yes this was not just applicable to former slaves but also to\nImmigrants and came close now there are still people who say that that was one kind of immigrant case it could be tested again but I think it's very interesting for our listeners to know that with respect to immigrants that was tested none of the Supreme Court\nMacs do you have any ... any reaction to this talk about um an executive order rescinding the fourteenth amendment\nWell I'm reminded of what people set up a Bill Clinton about how this is a booth bait for bubba is I mean this is not a serious proposal I don't think even Donald Trump himself imagines that he can re send birthright citizenship by executive order this is simply a way\nAlright max thank you very much Brian and max will be back later in the show when we return

[noise]\nI'm Jonathan Capehart and you're listening to America on the line from WNYC in public radio\nStations around the country [noise] here's a question for you do Americans value of democracy less than we used to what a lot of us be okay with the leader who wasn't required to work with Congress\nThe answer is yes according to the world values survey which measures attitudes about democracy and with that in mind that's our question for you tonight how do you feel about democracy is our system of government working for you or could you imagine living under a different system\nAnd authoritarian system military leadership\nCall us at ... for for seven four or five eight to five five that's eight four four seven four or five talk\nOur colleagues at radiolab are doing a special episode on democracy time to election day reporter a lot of Nasser joins us from Los Angeles and tell us more about how liberal democracy is regarded by its citizens welcome\nTo underline letter thank you very much All right so this this is fascinating and so you're you're ... episode starts off with something called as I mentioned before the world values survey and ...\nUm the let me see where is that first question the first question and the survey is this how do you feel about having a strong ruler who doesn't have to bother with Congress or election what people say in response to that\nThe researcher who who sort of scientists for as a as a political scientist Josh a monk at Harvard and and he was comparing weight that people were answering these questions Americans were answering these questions\nAre back in the nineties and then in the latest version of the survey and so the question or would you say that having a strong leader who does not have to bother with Congress in elections is a good way of governing the country I'm\nUh in Nineteen Ninety five about twenty four percent of Americans endorsed this idea of the strongman leader or in the latest survey thirty two percent it ...\nThat would that's incredible go ahead go ahead yeah\nWhich is really ... which is really surprising like a a I think for yeah for for\nFor someone like me like coming from an immigrant family like the the the thing that you know the value in democracy so much to hear that there is this this widespread discontent in this country that it's a that even you know as a strongman leader that doesn't have to bother with Congress that's a very anti democratic\nIdeal that that you know might be appealing to to that many people so the second question was how important is it for you to live in a democracy on a scale of one to ten\nRight and so uh and so in that question about two thirds of older Americans which is to say those American born in the thirties or forties would give the highest response is very very important to live in a democracy you know the top the numbers\nUm but less than one third of millennials dead so it's really generational you see that uh yeah for younger people it's not quite as important to live in a democracy OK so before\nI get to the third question let's dive into this a little bit deeper ... is the millennial response is fascinating and is that because of a\nA lack of trust in institutions and ... and if so what is driving that do you think\nYeah well there's a few there's a few reasons that especially that this researcher your mom equally standards of living have sort of stagnated so younger people see you know the success that their parents had that they don't see that themselves having that same success nurse feeling\nA a a a little unhappy about it another possibility is that you know you have older generations who remember a World War two I remember the Cold War\nOr they feel like they have something to compare it to they they know\nThat uh you know what uh Germany or the you know what fascism was like they know what I'm what Soviet communism was like an and they can say oh at least our democracy is not is not as bad as that whereas now for millennials who you know have come of age a post Cold War\nUh there's really nothing else to compare it to and say you look at the system and it's just sort of dysfunctional and you think oh this this sucks [laughter] and the third\nThe third question is do you think army rule is a good system of government how did people respond to that\nYes it is it's it's it's a very surprising thing so their share of us citizens who thinks that it would be a good are very good thing for the army to rule so in Nineteen Ninety five just one in sixteen respondents agreed with that and then the last time this survey was done a one in six agreed\nWhat's ... what's behind that yeah\nNo and it well and and just to make it even more of like saying ... among among young affluent Americans one in three agreed that army rule would be good or very good\nWhile I'm ... I asked I asked that last\nQuestion to get the army um military rule question out of the way because Allen is called in from Brooklyn or to answer our questions about how do you feel about ... is our system of government working for you um can you imagine living under a\nSystem Alan what see you\nWell the the day I Would realize that we're not a democracy would be the day it's not the night before that I Would leave um other than fighting for democracy\nUm I'm a son of a Jewish immigrant from polling\nWho left in I'm In the light of a Nazi a Nazi taking power in Germany I'm ... years later after the war and you know uh well during the Cold War when I went to visit his town in Poland and just\nReturning from going from East Germany to West Germany I was put in prison because of my papers warrant in order a they had forgotten to give me what they called the transit visa and just being in a place where\nYou know you realize you have no records\nUm there's you know there is no opportunity to exercise freedom of speech or if you do it's either repressed or it's meaningless and then years later I worked as a journalist in ah in Chechnya where these people\nWho are you opposed Russia were just literally obliterated a civilian city\nA civilian city which would they called the worst onslaught of the worst bombing since uh the bombing of Dresden was annihilated but couldn't [noise] so what are you there you go you know that's what you get when you don't have choice\nWell I was about to ask you you have a band to places where democracy is in short supply if you know not exist in if you are\nAs letter just pointed out your millennials are are are down on democracy or and down on the system of government we have now in one sentence what would you say to millennials um that would be sort of a rhetorical shaking them by the ...\nWell you know I I asked a Chechen journalist what would you tell Russians for change their idea and she gave me this wonderful idea which I Would mold a little differently and she said\nI Would do a soap opera or the Russian man and a Chechen woman in love\nWell I Would do something on the net that would capture\nWhat it is to live under a society because people have to appreciate it and understand it in their gut they don't understand the only way that you could possibly come up with the statistics that we're just sign it they don't understand what it's like to live in that kind of science\nAllen I Want to thank you very much for calling into America on the line and let's go to the state next well you have to cross New Jersey to get to Pennsylvania but let's call it let's talk to Peter in parks bird Pennsylvania thank you very much for calling into America on the line\n[noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to America on the line from ... in my see what happens returns in its entirety on friday November second\n\n[noise] there's a lot going on in Washington and it can be hard to keep up with the latest news and even harder to put it in the contacts and so every Wednesday we take a look at the biggest issues and out comes with an adolescent reporters who can help us make sense of it on joined us Wednesdays from the latest news out of Washington and why it matters for Wisconsin\nCentral time weekday afternoon from three until seven or online anytime at WNPR dot org\nSupport for WPRI comes from a women's entrepreneurship day Wisconsin November nineteenth that minority terrorists in Madison featuring female business owners nonprofit leaders policymakers and more\nW.

Democrats feeling pretty good about their chances in general that's the ... the topic of the political environment um\nUh it's almost more of a structural issue for the governorships hum of those twenty competitive\nA governorships um fourteen are held by the geo pay a whole bunch of those are actually open seats um\nAnd those are the sorts of seats which can can can flip 'em so uh if you will take take the big picture for the governors' seats um I Would expect\nA of a a net change the Democrats' direction between three and tenth seats um if it gets to be tendencies and if a ... sort of on the outer edge of what's possible um that would actually be enough to flip\nA control quote unquote of the uh of of the governors' seats I'm from the G O P which currently has um [noise] uh thirty a a thirty three\nUh seats amateur chef is thirty two Democratic at you I'm a just in the course of one one cycle\nWhere I Am I'm Glad you brought that up because I was going to ask you a thirty six governorship how many are controlled by Republicans and how many are controlled by a by Democrats and in terms of state legislatures do you have ... ... at your fingertips\nHow many state ... state legislatures both houses leaving out Nebraska raskin unit camera system but um\nHow many ... legislatures are completely in the hands of the Republican Party or completely in the hands of the Democratic party\nThat's a great question actually come back to the\nTalk of I I Do know ... generally that that the joke he has a lot more ... these are called ... effective right I'm a than the Democrats too and I should say that um\nThat ah there's a pattern it's a long term historical pattern\nThat um that if a party hold the White House they're bound to lose seats actually in Congress as well but as far as what we're talking about um they are bound to lose government governorships and also state legislature control it's just a natural sort of ... kind of\nA act by the voters I'm a a ... typically especially in these big mid term elections when so many governors' seats are up I'm a mid mid term elections are really bad historically for the party in power and the White House\nAnd there is a sort of a bleed down effect where a voter is take out their sort of aggressions on the party\n... and so it's very common like you know in the Obama years the Democrats that terribly in terms of governors races in state legislatures and um now what we're seeing this is the first midterm under Trump [noise] um and ah if things go as as a seems seems\nSeems to be expected that the Democrats should gain the question is uh\nIs the degree of that game will it be just a small number of seats or will it be a larger number\n... ... and I was asking the question about state legislatures and wishing on the number governorship governorships because we had former attorney general Eric Holder on the show or a little while back in right now he's big effort to use the chairman of the national democratic redistricting committee\nAnd they've been very focused on state legislatures and governors ships because I'm ... the election is twenty\nEighteen they're focused on redistricting effort\nThat happens after this after the twenty twenty cents is and how that plays a part in redrawing congressional districts and the party in power in the governor's mansion in state legislatures are the ones who control how those districts are drawn to that's why\nThese races are also very embarrassing very very important I've slowly\nYeah I'm a uh the the cycle that we're in right now which uh uh the uh the uh the uh twenty Eighteen cycle go back ... I'm a a total of eight years and even before that sixteen years ago a lot of the the sort of ground level\nUm structural issues for for the Republicans actually stem back really as far as two thousand two it's sort of weird so in two thousand two came in the recession and voters in a really large number of states throughout the incumbents because there were states physical crises and they were very dissatisfied with their state government\nUm and uh it was a strange pattern blue states went red and red states went blue\nThose governors who are elected in two thousand two for the most part served eight years two terms they were out and twenty ten and twenty ten huge GOP wave here [noise] so you have a lot of states I'm ah in twenty ten that are sort of purple states maybe even bluer states\nUm ah they actually chose ... governors that year a lot of them and that was sort of the basis for why there's so many GOP governor's no because they they actually won and Twain ten strong GOP are now those guys for the most part of being termed out a after two terms and so\nThere are a ton of open seats for the for the governorships this year I'm giving the Democrats a lot of opportunity to complete to compete\nIn places like say Iowa and Ohio and Michigan and Maine states which are sort of ... um and they lost ground and twenty ten and now they have a fresh chance in a much better democratic environment um to actually win a lot of those seats back\nAlright ... my last question for you and I'm not making a yes or no or this blue wave that everyone's been talking about that certainly Democrats are hoping will happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Madison", "day": "31"}
