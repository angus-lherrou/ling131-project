P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nWNYC radio I'm Charlie Sykes in for Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC in public radio stations across the country\nEvery Monday through Thursday we're here with the latest political news analysis and your calls tonight we have the first the new series that will be bringing you on the ... in the closing days of this campaign field reports from the battleground\nWill be in three key states for updates on the races that will shape our next two years Missouri Nevada and New Jersey but first a quick update on the news of the day\nThis afternoon President Trump acknowledge the Saudi journalist Washington Post columnist your ... is likely dead he said the evidence seems indicate that the show he was murdered but stopped short of blaming the Saudi crown prince and he made the comments to the New York times\nAnd they quoted him as saying of Saudi Arabia\nThey've been a good ally and they bought massive amounts of various things in investments in this country which I appreciate and meanwhile let them a potent is weighing in on this says the U.S bears a certain responsibility and he wonders why the Saudis\nHaven't been punished as the Russians were for alleged use of chemical weapons so it kind of being fooled by Vladimir potent\nAnd tonight ABC News reports exclusively the secretary of state Mike Pompeo was played the table ... being murdered and was given a transcript of it by Turkish officials State Department denied that he had heard that tape but did not address whether he had read the transcript of the recording\nAnd meanwhile the Dow Jones filling a three hundred points today after dropping eight hundred points in a single day last week\nAnd if there's an October surprise for voters it just might be what's happening to their four one K. is this month\nAnd a Republican Party survey by the polling from public opinion strategies which was leaked to Bloomberg Businessweek\nFinds that the upcoming election is mostly not about the economy jobs trade or any other issue the report says research indicates the determining factor in this election is how voters feel about President Trump\nAnd that's our question for you tonight is your vote whoever you're voting for or against isn't meant to be a referendum on Donald Trump and is it his policies or his tone is personality that you are reacting to so when you go to the polls are you voting for or against Donald Trump even though he's not on the ... give us a call\nAid for for seven four or five talk that's aid for for seven four or five eighty two fifty five and you can also send us a tweet using the hash tag eight oh tia okay\nIf get started with our battle ground field reports we have three reporters standing by to update us on the campaigns in their states three fascinating states well here from New Jersey\nWhere there are some races the Democrats hope will be the key to flipping the house then we're going to go to Missouri for an update on the Senate race between democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill and a Republican challenger Josh Hawley and finally to Nevada where there is a tight Senate race between incumbent Republican Dean Heller and Democrats Jackie rose and we're going to start\nWith Nancy Solomon managing editor of New Jersey public radio who joins me live in the studio right now so thanks for coming in ... ... ... ... what is the state of the race in the Garden State lots of bugs that Bob Menendez might be in trouble where are we at tonight well he's\nChallenger Republican ... who's a pharmaceutical executive um some polls have had him down into single digits but he he's been depending on the poll bouncing around I think ah from all that I've looked at Democrats are\nLikely to hold their noses and vote for him because they are concerned about Donald Trump and um you know the the biggest problem the Democrats face with Bob Menendez\nBesides the fact that they didn't offer up a candidate to primary him when they should have is that\nThe Democratic seats in the house that are up for reelection aren't competitive races so your ... your democratic strongholds in the state aren't going to see the kind of turnout that we're going to see in the five Republican held districts where the turnout is you know they're expecting a democratic surge\nAnd so that's gonna hurt Mendez but uh I think when all is said and done I think he's going to get out\nOkay well I Want to come back for more details because this has really turned into a a nasty race even even buying New Jersey's stance let's go to Missouri now\nIn Allison height of the Kansas City star or thanks for joining us Allison appreciate it\nThanks for having me well let's talk about what's going on in in in Missouri right now I'm In Claire McCaskill always seems to be in sort of a perilous you know the perils of Pauline always seems to be waging uphill fight 'em how she faring as of right now\nRight well Missouri is a state that voted for president Donald Trump by something like Nineteen points so um it's a difficult state for a Democrat to win is as one of the most important Senate races in the country one of the closest Senate races in the country I'm In right now it looks like an absolute toss up the cook Political Report has it as a toss up the last poll I saw\nHad Holly ... polling at forty five and McCaskill at forty four\nInterestingly in that poll they asked undecided voters are voters that didn't answer it where they were leaning and got the exact same answer Holly forty five McCaskill forty four\nSo it's a very very tight race um and pretty much every poll that we've seen is within the margin of error um it's also one of the most expensive Senate races this cycle out of the center for Responsive Politics\nHad as a second over almost expensive race and the most expensive race in terms of outside spending\nAnd the closer we get to election day I'm the nasty or it gets you know we've got\nJust an onslaught of political ads the ads against Holly are calling him you know a lot of climbing politician and the geo piece golden boy\nThey've been going after him over health care and the ads against one call a McCaskill are accusing her being out of touch with Missouri\nI'm Holly campaign of trying to Penn McCaskill two Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi um he's been on a stop Schumer fire Claire to wear and his campaign bus has um himself on obviously and then McCaskill Schumer and Pelosi\nAnd of course now we have an undercover video which apparently we can't have a campaign without one of those so I was more to come back to the ... and just he was the moment and finally I Want to go out to a Las Vegas in the ... of the Nevada\nIndependent um look I mean there are a lot of states that have crazy politics but uh I mean you're right up there [laughter] that is\nOne of that one of the crazier states to cover that's for sure but yeah we have one of that one of the craziest Senate races this cycle and your governor's race was pretty nuts to it at\nOur governor's races crazy too yeah we have quite quite a lot going on out here and in the west [laughter]\nOkay well let's talk about this all about the Senate race because a lot I think a lot of Democrats thought that the incoming Republican Dean Heller was dead men walking that this was the number one and number two biggest pickup prospect\nFor them um ... the last poll I saw would suggest that but ... is is ahead or even but what are you looking\nAt right so a lot of the people that are the cycle of really had that\nYou wrote an up by a few but within the margin of error so not really you know statistically significant there was one poll recently were held there was a little bit ahead but everyone on the ground here really think it's still a toss up you know this could go either direction but like you mentioned\nYou know how there was considered the most vulnerable will ... will never will Republican and the Senate and and he still is but he's actually been able to get around some of the issues that were really big Sorenson inside\nAt the beginning of the campaign one of the big issues that\nJackie rather than who is a political newcomer\nShe the first time Congress woman she was recruited by Harry Reid to run for the house and twenty sixteen so she doesn't have a lot of experience but she's been going after Heller really hard on health care um Heller with one of those senators\nWho came out initially when Senate Republicans were debating repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act and said you know no I have some concerns about this but then he eventually voted for that motion to proceed voted for the skinny repeal of the Affordable CARE Act to get rid of the individual mandate\nSo Jacky Rosen thing going after him saying you know you flip flopped on the Affordable care\nAct she's been running these really memorable ad\nFeaturing the orange inflatable to man the kind of thing you see outside the car repair shop at sort of come here a type deal she's been running ads accusing him of being senator fine let's go to saying he's been blowing with the winds of Washington and\nThat sort of been her biggest attack against him is that these cave to Senate Republican leadership and he came to president Donald Trump going against the ... best interests up to that and and what's interesting about that it's ... actually said that he was Ninety nine percent opposed to Donald Trump during the\n... election he's been slowly warming to the president over the last two years um you know it was really happy about tax or farming campaigning on that issue\nSo Jacky Rosen and sort of trying to keep her her head above water and and sort of just run a straightforward campaign and the biggest attack ... thing against her as the fact that she's a political newcomer and running ads against her things she's accomplished zero in the house she accomplished zero before she announced her bed for the Senate so you know why do you want to elect her when\nYou know I've been around he he first I was in the house in two thousand six he's been around for twelve years that they have that experience contrast as well\nBut it was interesting because a ... which was not pro Trump infect looked like he was going to face a primary from a very very cruel a pro Trump candidate Danny Tarkanian apparently Donald Trump cold often and Danny Tarkanian to run for Congress instead and now ... seems to be pretty Trump being running running in this campaign\nJust an a you know thanks to all three of you for being here in America on the line we have to go to a break and when we come back how much money to the Saudis released spend them United States anyway and what does human ... has to do the voter registration stay

I have a theory that's kind of depressing but you know OK I'm sure any explanation of this will be depressing\nLook Trump ... has been flirting with neo Nazis or for the last couple of years are starting at least with when he initially did not disowned endorsement from David Duke uh so the idea that this would be like beyond the over to the window at this point I I think is\nIs sadly a little ridiculous right like we have become accustomed to the fact that's exactly\nThat's exactly what my theory was going to be that that having seen all the things that were considered quote unquote acceptable to two years ago that we have in fact move the window of acceptability there was something that would have been a massive controversy just a couple of years ago is is not and apparently\nIt and it doesn't appear to shock the conscience of of Republicans who apparently had been ignored to this kind of you know hyper re flying\nAnd I also agree with that and it's sort of on brand in some sense we are Steve King in particular\nMaria it's the normal life you know they're normalizing of it right it's it's absolutely the number of it the normalizing of it um regarding Steve King I'm I was recently in his district about a year ago that somewhat recent in political terms um he's his district is majority Latino in Iowa\nMajority Latino residents I Know your eyes are pirate yeah not not voters but in terms of you know the fastest growing demographic in Iowa hello Latinos and let the not\nJust in terms of contacts by the way I also met a Latino there who was pro Trump so just a little bit of context but in terms of\nWhat I'm this notion of a it's it's normalizing white supremacy\nNow on the other side you know before you could not say the word white supremacy without just be just a this kind of horror of people like we have to talk about white supremacy we have to talk about what it looks like structurally and what this raises is\nPrecisely the question that you're asking Charlie why is it that people are not speaking out about you let me\nRespond to that I don't disagree with you but I think that\nIt that often in terms of racism and which ones are thrown around so much that people have a ... when the real thing I mean you're talking about an actual neo Nazi white nationalist comes along\nThat we don't we don't calibrate our responses in the in the same way because this is I mean this is this is something that that ought not to be you know not to be controversial but it's not close call here\nBut I don't think the problem is that we're too quick to call the no I I really don't and and and\nPeople don't walk around throwing the term white supremacy it's I'm a journalist I have an analysis I'm looking at things structurally I'm hearing what people are saying most people are not out there saying that so I I Want to caution about well everybody's kind of I don't I don't agree\nI disagree with my esteemed colleagues on this I actually think that there has been a a permit skew his use of terms like white supremacy\nAnd racism over the years and I think even some you know conscientious liberals have acknowledged it and the era of Trump and said you know we called\nMitt Romney racist and we called John McCain or racist and that was unjust and you know we regret it now because now we really need the term to have the same moral force a and it doesn't because there there's the boy who cried wolf problem and now there's a real wolf\nOh go on a ... by so many things I'm I'm Sorry but I sort of brutal took us off on an on on on that direction I'm Kevin I Want to talk to you about ... about money\nAnd what about the Saudi money issue\nThis obsession that Donald Trump has with how much economic value the Saudi Arabian connection has for us in in ... to tell me about that and and how deeply it appears to be influencing the administration's response to the brutal murder of ...\nI Would say that the United states has always had to some extent a naked like transactional relationship with the Saudis but\nTo Trump that's like a virtue right he he sort of believe that the fact that he doesn't prioritize American values that instead he prioritizes American economic interests are financial interest\nThat's a good thing and you know a lot of supporters believe that as well I mean they they said he's not eating illogical that's a great and he can make great deals for us well he's focusing on the great deal he's not focusing on our values\nAnd that's a problem clearly I\nAnd we as a country should be promoting our values around the world and holding our trading partners and anybody we had any sort of relationship with Sheila count when they fall short\nBut Trump has openly said I mean there isn't sort of this tape bring over at like well let's come up with some other excuse about why do you want to maintain his relationship he just comes out and says now we're getting money from them that's a good thing\nSo motives that is is is that just honesty or is he just being more honest about something that's been the reality for four years is is it is is it not a departure that we should be concerned about [noise] [laughter] well\nI'm In the first place um they're the president's suffers and at times like this from a character flaw namely that that he is utterly amoral he has no moral sense whatsoever\nAnd soda moment like this when people do expect I think the president to express America's revulsion in general at at this kind of behavior he's kind of incapable it's as if he's being asked to speak a foreign language [noise]\n\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you are listening to America on the line from WNYC as it happens returns on friday November second\n\nWisconsin Public radio

about the mid term elections from WNYC in public radio stations around the country and I'm back\nWhat are brilliant panel Latino USA host ... host of the Washington Post Catherine Rampell in Washington columnist and author Mona churning I promise we'll be taking your calls in the segment do and here's a question I mentioned this poll commissioned by Republicans that concluded that\nThis election is really not about the economy stupid it's not about other things it is about how people feel about President Trump's so do you agree\nOr they're in a positive or negative way when you vote are you voting for or against Donald Trump or is there another reasons you can call it an aid for for seven four or five talk it's a four four seven four or five eighty two fifty five\nOkay just the question but it's been like in his me to hear\nHow do you think it is that the Republicans work the Kavanaugh come from\nOn this how does it become a story about mob rule smear tactics in and being in the smearing of of an innocent man well Christine Blasey Ford\nWho everybody said was credible and compelling when she was testify has really just disappeared as a factor I mean it is being a couple of weeks and that almost seems to be invisible so I mean is this this is how Republicans win the battle is no more I I Know you may have a different perspective on all of this\n[noise] yes I um I actually think this was ... on the part of the Democrats um they piled on too much\nThey embraced um implausible and even outlandish accusations along with a serious accusation that his forwards\nAnd by so doing they diluted the strength of her accusation and they allowed I'm both a Kavanaugh and other Republicans to say well the Democrats are just flinging all of this mud and they and Michael ... was a gift to them\nSo that they could then just say throw in the Ford accusation with the less credible ones and um and deny that any of them had credibility\nJasmine I it's true if you had asked me a couple of months ago I thought it would be good for Republicans to have their Supreme Court pick at credibly accused of sexual assault I would've said absolutely not no there's no conceivable universe in which this could be a\nPolitical positive and clearly it has been it has become such a thing\nUm I think it's maybe partly that Democrats and you know did give too much weight to the to like the ... claim which had to be walked back\nBut I think it's also that Republicans are just willing to play dirty or to some extent and Trump himself you know he was warned don't attack a lousy Ford's credibility don't attack her personally and initially he didn't\nBut it to some extent maybe it was the turning point that he went after her directly that he that he doesn't have any qualms about attacking a credible that can or sexual assault and and that's affecting somehow you\nKnow I'm I think a lot of women I'm not sure what this was going to mean in terms of the midterms but I think there are a lot of women who are still\nStill kind of trying to catch up with what happened\nUm in terms of the nomination and confirmation of capital I'm I'm Still as I travel across the country since um since he's been confirmed I'm continuing to hear the same thing that women are still coming to terms with things that happened to them [noise]\nUm and the kind of shock of it all and again the normalization of of now justice Kavanaugh um but I think that how did this happen that the narrative shifted\nSo I'm a again he brings me no joy to say these things but I think that um if you think about who is actually running America's newsrooms who has a kind of maybe an understanding of let's let's be concerned about the young men in the world America's newsrooms have become\nLess diverse since September eleventh there not more diverse so we have to think about how certain narratives are picked up and and that they become the central narrative which is now now that we have to be concerned about young men as opposed to what women are experiencing so I just I think in terms of a structural perspective\nUm who who's in our newsrooms\nSo ... this this may not relate to directly to this but did you hear the story but Ellen magazine online tweeted out this a click bait tweak the the the ... and you know Kanye West and came crashing or breaking up and if and if you clicked on it if you got sucked into that you were sent a voter registration website so\nI guess I I'm not clear about is a smart way to get young women to register to vote or is it\nIs it more insulting and condescending\nHimself [laughter] I don't think in the Senate or the second you know what was going to be convinced by this who's going to be if\nGet their click bait and they're going to say well I'm closing that window you know if you actually want people to register to vote and make the case\nFor them to ... the last thing that we need the media right now is to be kind of clearly being manipulative that just is not helpful I just can't see what the upside\nIt I'm ... I mentioned before that I wanted to talk about the you know race is like for example in in Nevada where\nUm the real big question is is will the Hispanic vote turnout insufficient numbers and there's been all kinds of stories and surveys suggesting that than Democrats are expressing real anxiety um over a ... on motivated his Hispanic\nOh my God well we'll wait let me stop oh my goodness wait a second Democrat Democrat the Democratic institutions are concerned about what's happening with the Latino vote right now how many days we have left to let me get a little late thank you so what's happening [laughter]\nThe thing is is that you have to understand that this is ... and again we were just speaking off off Mike about you can't make these huge generalizations about Latino Latino voters across the country I mean this is like a huge group\nFifty million plus people um you know there are Latinos from Utah there are Latinos from Florida and there are Latinos from Chicago and we are all very different not monolithic not at all monolithic so\nBut what what is monolithic sadly Charlie ... is that Latinos and let the nuts across the board I understand that we are being targeted\nIt's not like maybe maybe we're being targeted no\nWe understand that Latinos and letting us were born in the United states along the U.S Mexico border\nTheir passports are not being renewed those ... they are coming into renewed their American why are we not seeing this explosion that he has a ... because you know when there is also a sense of feeling very much attacked but not spoken to\nSo what do I need I mean like actually ground troops like actually let's look at what ... what Alexandria Ocasio Cortez did which was a serious ground game people to people this is not\nYou weren't you are not going to be able to put any Latino candidate\nI'm a young Castro for example who I was just with his book is out he's going to have to work very very very hard at going after these let the Latino voters they are not just going to show up because everybody dropping the ball is that what you're suggesting that the Democrats have been dropping the ball let me see\nLet me see well most recently after just you know listening to um slow burn and and really focusing on Bill Clinton and the author of what Bill Clinton was doing in terms of his policies on immigration\nOn the border you know and all of his hard line we've gotta stop immigration to where he was doing that he wrote the laws in Nineteen Ninety six that has led us to this place where people can be detained held and deported those were those were the laws and this was the Democrat\nI Want to come back and ask you another question about this because I I I don't fully grasp what what's happened but it is ... fool you amount of political malpractice on the part of Democrats who are now saying hey we have not figured out how to mobilize the Hispanic vote and then it at our fault yeah let's let's go let's go to get a couple of calls you've asked the question when you turn out and vote assuming that you are going to vote", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "19"}
