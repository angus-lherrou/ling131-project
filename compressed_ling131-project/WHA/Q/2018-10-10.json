P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n\n[noise] from WNYC radio and Jonathan Capehart in this is America on the line a news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nEvery Monday through Thursday we're here with the latest political news analysis and your calls and we have a very full agenda tonight so let's begin with the news of the\nDay and for that I'm joined by REO Edwards levy polling director and political ... political reporter for huff post are welcome to America on the line\nIt get so much for having me okay so like I said there's a lot there's a lot going on the big news today was the surprise resignation of the U.S ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley\nOr any idea as to why she would make such an announcement twenty eight days before the midterm elections and yet she is not leaving until the end of the year\n\nIt is an interesting sort of kind of timing there and you know I don't know if there's ever a great time make decisions but it definitely does sort of ... news cycle back\nFrom talking about ... having all that she had sort of unusual legs and this news environment back into the chaos of the Trump White house and you know I don't know if it's still going to be talking about by the time that run its voting but it's certainly what we're talking about now\nRight well we're talking about it now but as we are actually speaking the president is at yet another campaign rally this time in Iowa can you talk more about the president's campaign schedule and why\nIowa tonight Florida and the White House last night he was going to Ohio on friday what's going on here\nYeah um I think the question right now is going to be pretty much how fired up Republicans are going to be in that church we know that Democrats\nAre fired up for a whole host of reasons but right now\nA lot of it has to do with keeping Republican energy up high and you know you're seeing him out there he just turned out to Democrats as dangerous which is sort of an interesting in version of twenty sixteen rhetoric and obviously as a pretty full schedule out there right now\nI'm the one thing that we're we haven't been talking about and in any of the world this would be major news that was the un report that came out yesterday warning that climate change is happening more rapidly and with more serious consequences than anyone had thought\nI'm the president said he wants to look at and this is what he said who drew it\nThat's what he said in his in his words is this un report do you think something that um the Trump White house and the president particular will take seriously\n\nYeah it's sort of an amazing combat and it's sort of amazing how much a story like that it's just not making traction over the un over\nA Nikki Haley over the election um you know climate change is one of those issues that seems perennially eight sort of boiling but never really gets to the point where it's an eight story today and it hasn't really been in the Paris accord so you know it's hard to see what's going to change\nA and one more a sin to leading issue to talk about speaking of the electric going back to the election Taylor Swift\nOn Sunday when she announced through Instagram that she was going to ... to support the Democrat running for Senate Senator in Tennessee the former governor former governor Britain's and\nUm she encouraged her one hundred twelve million followers to register to vote and vote dot org experience and unprecedented flood of new registrations nationwide\nUm they're quoted as saying up to sixty five thousand registrations in a single twenty four hour period since Taylor Swift post now we talk a lot about the impact of celebrity endorsements but there's no denying that Taylor Swift had an impact here\nYeah I mean that makes you think it might be a little bit of a taste of what I Would call post ...\n... ... in that day also happen to me you know you go to registration deadline and a whole lot of states which I Would think might also have a little bit at that age so certainly you know when somebody it felt like I had an impact it a little heart tangled Bactrim jazz\nYou know an election suddenly living as a lot of people encouraging everyone to get out there and you\nAre right REO ... thank you very much for being on America on the line it get so much for having me\nNow with the mid term elections now exactly one month from today we're starting to see more campaign ads and it seems like a good time to check in on the messaging\nAnd let's start with the Republican themes that are bubbling up themes like my opponent is a socialist or the Democrats are going to impeach Brett Kavanaugh or the Democrats are going to teach President Trump or both\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell today thank the Capitol police for keeping senators safe from what he called mob tactics used by the far left\nLet's dive in to all of this with longtime conservative a commentator and writer Charlie Sykes he is a Milwaukee resident and he's also the author of how to write lost its mind at Charlie thank you very much for being on America on the line as usual here\nSo right now the president is in Iowa he at another campaign rally he is hammering away at\nAt the Democrats the Democratic party Democrats by name I'm Elizabeth Edwards\nA Maxine Waters Nancy Pelosi you name it he's attacking them\nWhy is the president going after Democrats in and also advancing this notion that you know the the Democrat is this law lifts mom when there are other things he could be talking about such as the great economy why isn't he doing\nThat that's an extraordinarily interesting question and and and I think it reflects the the the nature of our politics which is dominated by negative partisanship look Donald Trump understand\nI think would believe that that in order to get the conservative base riled up he needs a foil he needs to have an other an enemy\nSo the Democrats are not just wrong on the issues there for open borders they're going to let the MS Thirteen into your community or they're going to bankrupt the country they are socialists or they are getting up these mobs\nAnd you you can tell that that that this has been a consistent theme for Donald Trump that Donald Trump um and and the Republicans have a lot more energy when it comes to describing what they're against what they are outraged about and what they want voters to be afraid of as opposed to what they're actually four\nAnd ... well will these fear tactics work\nI mean you could argue that they worked in twenty sixteen are they going to work in twenty Eighteen what what part of a that's a key point that they did work in twenty sixteen by making into a binary choice and the binary choices basically you don't have to like Donald Trump you don't have to believe and Donald Trump but no matter how awful he is the other side is old\nSo if you can make that into that binary choice that's the formula that that I think the Republicans are going to at least to the Trump the five\nRepublicans up it's who knows whether it's going to work or not um we may be heading into an election where we have a you know diverge results were will work in Senate elections in red states but failed miserably in house seats where you have a lot of college educated voters typically college educated women\nNow usually in a midterm election um everyone looks at this as a referendum on the president and with this particular president ... is that is that the case uh time's up thousands is this a referendum on Trump and and if so who wins if that's the case\nWell it is a referendum on Donald Trump or ... as you were describing a little bit or you know earlier there's almost no other stories can get traction were not able to talk about you know massive stories that have\nHuge consequences were not debating the future of the national deficit we're not talking about national security when it came about global climate change we're not even talking about what happened to those children who were separated at the border right everything is about Donald Trump and so this election is very much a referendum on Donald Trump and then once again\nWho's gonna win well he's still heavily underwater but\nI'm the Senate all this the control the Senate may be determined in states where he still is popular but I think this is an indication that Republicans are in deep trouble in the house\nOr a Charlie Sykes thank you very much you're going to be back a little bit later in the show with me now are Joan Walsh national affairs correspondent for the nation and Ben Smith editor in chief of buzzfeed Joan Ben welcome back to America on the line\nThink yeah forever far as we continue to keep the focus on the on the Republicans right now 'cause we're to talk about the Democrats in in in the next block up didn't you just give me your reactions to um\nTo what a REO was talking about in the news block in ... in Charlie's reactions to the questions about in particular the fear tactics and why isn't the president and why aren't Republicans if the economy is so great why are they not out on the stump talking about it\n\n\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise] you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[noise] starts\nOn us and K part and you're listening to America on the line we're back with Joan Walsh of the nation in buzzfeed's Ben Smith so for all the talk of a blue wave a takeover of the house and maybe even the Senate there are complains that the Democrats don't have a unified message and so my message to both or do they need one band\nBasically not I'm In mid term in midterm elections are typically to some you know they're driven by dislike of of the of the ruling party this case you know Donald Trump the house the Senate and that gives Democrats room to run very different campaigns and different places\nAnd so you see a Democrat in West Virginia running a campaign in which he supported Brett Kavanaugh for instance and Democrats in Florida and Georgia running kind of a much more progressive campaign you've ever seen in there and I think you know you you're going to see a very very wide range and an end who wins and who loses and there will will will say it will shape the party going for\nDrunk I mean do do are are Democrats running national races or or to pick up on Ben what benefits that are highly localized races or a combination of the two\nI think they're mostly localized I I just spent two weekends with Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA you know watching her talk about Medicaid expansion which is actually popular among sixty percent of Republicans are watching her barely mentioned even her opponent Brian Kemp and not mentioned I don't think that I should\nMentioning Donald Trump even once seriously she talks about ... cradle to career education she talks about losing eight million dollars a day because the state did not take federal money to expand Medicaid\nOr it it's it's a national race there's a lot of national attention there's national money on both sides but as she goes from you know appearance to appear and she's talking about why Valdosta doesn't get the same tax benefits or flexibility\nThat Atlanta does a and you know from what I see of Andrew Gillum he's doing the same so we you know here in the metropolitan elite a national reporters are obviously focusing on national trends and national meaning\nBut when you get down into the you know the but the state level and even more so in state legislative races you're seeing a very local message\n... speaking of your media elites in and our focus on non local issues one big issue is impeachment whether it's impeachment of judge justice Kavanaugh or impeachment of President Trump's\nNational reporters keep asking democratic candidates right leaders what they think of the issue here is um house minority leader Nancy Pelosi speaking with Dana Bash of CNN a week ago at the Atlantic women of Washington series\nSo let's focus that on that would not be my plan\nWould not be your plan to charge him and I have enough things on my back to impeach the president never saw that for\nWith the information that comes forward and when\nObject temperament that has not judicial that that will do the right thing\nAnd I think it's easy for we we metropolitan a lethal actually maybe it's more than just people who live on Twitter issue as sort of see these incredibly divisive national issues the central I think if you are running house races if you're in the house leadership\nIf if if you were ... if if you're thinking about a voter who is burning to pitch Donald Trump they're going to show up and vote for the Democrats and the voter that you are trying to get out as somebody who\nCares much more about a local issue cares about you know they're you know I think it's easy to forget that their independence of their swing voters that there are people who are less polarized and that's what Democrats are trying to pull their way and I think they know but I think none of them the impeachment as as as as helpful that meanwhile does get Republicans excited rent\nAnd what about the conversation about about civility about um civility whether you know the loss of it or\nFighting because the other party isn't isn't being civilized and I am saying that because I'm former Democratic presidential a nominee Hillary Clinton former secretary of state had something to say about that just this week just the other day here's what she said\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nSo to me what I Love about that quote is that it is it's basically telling people when you feel that your your country and everything that you you believe in and stand for is at stake that all this talk about civility is out the window until you get to a point where you can restore it no\nI mean I agree and I think that all the talk about civility is another example of the mainstream media and on ban might have my back on this or might not you know just one\nEquivalence and we are in a situation where we do have children and babies in jail we had children being taken away there we had an amazing a ... day about children who will never be returned to their parents are going to put the put up for adoption\nWe know about the climate change uh information we got this week\nWe have a party that is so beyond being civil or that is so slowly into power were told that when we yell about\nUh the charges against Brett Kavanaugh that we were not allowed to ever talk about Merrick Garland if you ever if you're ever on\nCable TV or you know in a debate and you mentioned Merrick Garland it's like oh well all you want as were then from Merrick Garland I don't want revenge and I just want it on the freaking record so there's no civility because of the Republicans\nI Want to go to John who is calling in from Raleigh North Carolina John thank you for calling in to America on the line\nHigh so you're you're a democratic precinct chair\nI Am so I made a low level Democratic Party official here in North Carolina um and yeah it's a little I'm loving this conversation that you all are having I'm On the radio and I just wanted to add a couple of viewpoints from here in the south beach hungrier I'm mom um yeah the the um\nWhat happened with Brett Kavanaugh and the way he presented themselves in the confirmation hearings with outrageous um\nHe did not pretend I'm chopped truthfully he um and the Republican senators did not represent 'em ... before it and so it isn't simply a women's issue and it's not that\nYou know we're a hysterical mob but we're normal everyday people were where [noise] you know Boy Scout leaders and fathers mothers and we just simply want their elected officials\nTo be decent people and more we have the same thing from the president I\nAm from Brett Kavanaugh is anything but the things that\nJohn I wanted to thank you very much for calling in from Raleigh North Carolina let's go to Brandon in St Louis Missouri Brandon thank you for calling into America on the line\nIn our area good so tell me what's on your mind brand [laughter]\nOh I'm Sorry I thought you were going to um when I was gonna say was I've been listening to the broadcast and uh and do the lady that uh the speaking she's the author um she was saying that that the people that voted for Trump or just angry white man I'm drawing a white man\nSaid I I'm Sorry to cut you off or going to have to leave it there in about six seconds we're going to take a break and come back with more America on

Greg and Charlie welcome to America on the line Charlie welcome back thank\nI'm Craig let me start with you I'm clearly Governor Walker's reelection races that the high high profile race in this\nReport that while Walker has strong support from the conservative base he's struggling to reach voters in the middle why do you think that is and why are swing voters so important in this race\nThey're important because Wisconsin's a really evenly divided state [noise] they swing by definition Scott Walker is always one independent voters in his victorious campaigns but he's losing them right now so his problems really go to sort of\nWhat we call it sort of true independents people that really don't lean toward either party but he also has a problem with with kind of soft Republicans independent leaning moderate Republicans a lot of these people\nBelong to that minority within the party that have major qualms about Donald Trump and the polling shows that they're supporting Scott Walker but by ... much smaller margins than the party base and they're also you know not very mobilize there are a lot less enthusiastic about voting so\nHe's got a problem with soft Republicans and he's got a problem with independence is partly has to do with Trump partly also has to do is you know running for a third term being around for eight years having run for president\nRight after winning his second term um he's got a lot going on there well\nEntirely that gets to the question I was going to ask you whether you thought a Walker's presidential bid or his current support of President Trump is affecting his chances in his current reelection bid for governor ... ...\nRight in his analysis there there there's a couple of things I've been going on with us Scott Walker number one is\nIn Rome or he's been around for eight years and he's been a been through three elections so there's a certain degree of Walker fatigue um and then of course you have the Trump hangover the wouldn't interesting thing about Scott Walker here in Wisconsin I Know Craig has written about this extensively is\nThey're remarkably few swing voters when it comes to a Scott Walker we we we are eight and evenly divided state but at the poll numbers for Walker generally don't move that much because people are so locked in place because the the political polarization after ... was so intense\nSo to a certain extent with the exception of the Trump factor\nThis election does feel like almost all of his other elections I mean almost in every one of those\nElections it looks like it's close it's tough and ... and then they they basically grind it out gutted out based on turn out so you know what what Craig says about the turnout is absolutely crucial if Democrats turnout in numbers be above and beyond what they normally turnout Scott Walker's in in trouble if you can if he does not\nUm turnout his hardcore crawl through you know fire you know over a glass of Republican base turnout and he's also in trouble as well because he always wins relatively narrowly and there's not a lot of swing voters and play\nI Want to ask you another question before I go to callers I didn't mention that his Democratic opponent is Tony ... and his campaign's been attacking a Scott Walker for cuts the main ... to education funding but Walker himself has declared that he is the quote education governor how's this issue playing out in the race\nWell it's a it's a huge issue I mean it's the one issue in the governor's race that both sides are talking about in their TV ads which makes it which is really interesting 'cause if you think of education is an issue that Democrats spend more time talking about but I think Scott Walker sensed it was a vulnerability because\nOf the cuts on education and the polling shows right now people actually prioritize education spending over tax cuts in Wisconsin\nSo he's tried to address that and of course he's running against the state school superintendent\nSo it's a big central issue and um and it you know it's going to have an impact on this race in the end\nOr I'm going to go to um I asked people from Wisconsin to call in to call in to a four four seven four or five eight to five five and you'll geese traveler from Madison, Wisconsin is calling in thank you for calling into America on the line\nOr a Walker over the last year or eight years is cutting millions of dollars and community schools and\nTwo hundred and fifty million dollars from the University of Wisconsin and they think about schools really anchor all these communities across Wisconsin and with across Wisconsin on the schools closed the communities really suffer and a lot of the families they move from those communities and an interesting dynamic here as we've had dozens of referendum\nAcross the state where communities repeatedly\nHad voted to increase their taxes to support their school so when they see their education\nYou know at their community school being cut and they have to go vote themselves to raise their own property taxes just to keep their schools open it shows you a real dichotomy there and you know when you compare that against a\nTony Evers who's a superintendent of schools and she's been talking about investing millions in schools and particularly in special education and it gives you a real contrast between the candidate and um you know this has also been playing out when you talk about infrastructure as well I mean our roads\nHave been rated the lowest here for years and you know for the last eight years you've had one party rule in ... they haven't been able to figure out mechanism to actually find our infrastructure and our roads a short of a raising fees on electric vehicles\nIn Hungary a vehicle you just let me ask you a question because I'd be able to point out that you are running for deemed county board district number six why are you running for office\nYeah so actually I I Am the Dane County board a district six a supervisor and one other one of the reasons I was just recently elected in April and one of the reasons I was really looking to run it because I think\nAll politics is local and the more we can focus on local issues and we have to enter a real important distinction in these midterms it's going to boil down to a lot of the issues that matter here in our communities like for example and our attorney general's race uh our attorney general has not test\nShe took years to test rape kits and if we think about what just played out with Dr Kevin are already when Dr Ford and a judge Kavanaugh\nYou know after somebody's experienced this trauma and then they go and they get this intrusive exam\nAnd to have that that rape kits sit on a shelf for years with the top law enforcement officer not addressing that it shows you I think how a lot of these local issues are going to quiet down so I don't think Trump is going to have as big an influence and people are going to say\nIs my life better in this state under one party rule or over the last eight years or am I ready for a change in the paper really seeing people ready for a change\nYou'll see some of the thank you very much for calling into America on the line when it goes to probably one of your neighbors in Madison, Wisconsin Carrie thank you for calling into America on the line\nHow are you thanks for having me I Am in the climate and neighborhoods and want to have voter\nOh okay [laughter]\nI I couldn't have said it better I mean I think\nUh it's interesting now with a third caller from Madison tonight I think we have experienced firsthand on this issue of you have to keep your eye on the bacon keep active on the small every election matters [noise]", "show_name": "Q", "year":
