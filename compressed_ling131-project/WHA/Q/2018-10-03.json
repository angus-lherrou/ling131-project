R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n[noise] from WNYC radio and Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line a news and call in show about politics in the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nEvery Monday through Thursday we bring you the latest political news analysis and opinion from you our listeners tonight we want to hear what you think about this comment from President Trump today\nWhile I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult time\nHe was speaking in response to the sexual assault accusations against judge Brett Kavanaugh what do you think\nIs he right about the status of young men in America we want to hear from you men and women men are you scared you'll be wrongly accused of something women\nAre you surprised ... asking this question a year after me to give us a call at eight four four seven four or five talk that's eight four four seven four or five eight to five five you can also send us a tweet using the hash tag ... H O T L\nWe'll be talking about the growing gender divide in how it may impact the midterm elections a little later in the show but for now we want to bring you up to date on the ... the latest news developments there's the progress of the FBI investigation of claims against judge Kavanaugh there's an update on Rod Rosenstein job status\nOh and the New York times is reporting that President Trump appears to have committed tax fraud\nAcclaim denied by Trump's lawyer and also by the White House or a statement that just hit seconds before we went on air from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders oh and now New York state is investigating so another typical slow news day\nLet's turn now to Washington Post reporter amber Philips amber welcome back to America on the line happy\nTo be I'm okay so let's take the the er the last thing first and that is the the latest response from the White House from Sarah Huckabee Sanders about this bombshell New York times story about the ... they're flat out calling it a tax fraud\nOf not just a now President Trump but the entire Trump family\nYeah I'm I'm as you said it's coming out before or on the arts them reading it right now it does not look like she Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaking out specifically denies the allegations are the key line here as\nMany decades ago the IRS for you and signed off on those trends accents and then she goes on to attack\nThan New York times or what that suggests to me is that there's not a clear denial of the things that the New York times accuses President Trump of doing that being said the New York times that quote Trump lawyer saying a\nOr denying any allegations that actual brought in masturbation\nA new one of the ... one of the instant analysis of this is that it sort of blows a hole into the president's image or that he has perpetuated of himself as\nA self made a self made man who went from queens to Manhattan and made it big and made it bigger than even his own father do you think that\nAll on the president's standing\nI have stopped guessing that a long time ago what will stick with the with the president um you know I I my own personal theory is if you're on the left and you don't like President Trump you got any number of things to be mad about to get you to the voting booth the the million dollar question of course is what\nThe Trump base feel about him with all the negative news coverage and if there is something that could sort of pull apart the glue between Trump and his base\nThis is certainly a possibility he went out this is the complete opposite story that the president's successfully sold to voters in two thousand sixteen that he'll run the country and like he has his jumping higher right\nYeah and I think go ahead but it was just I wanted to add that like a ... last summer there was also a New York state but the kitchen that charity let's run as a fraud and so if you look at these together in the picture of a remarkable lack of integrity of the Christian\nRight now I should also point out that New York state um put out a statement today saying that they're going to be taking a look at some of the the the allegations that are in the New York times report let's move now to do what's going on with the FBI probe of\nThe allegations against judge Kavanaugh Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said today that this whole thing could be wrapped up later today if not tomorrow and Dr Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys have been out have said\nThat they haven't heard from the FBI from a process prospective amber how can\nHow can Senate Republicans actually wrap this up in it by Wednesday and have anyone believed that this was the process that Senator Flake Collins Murkowski and and and Coons and others are wanting to have happen\nThere is a critical political question here and that's the question of also determined judge Kaplan I space is\nWhenever the FBI investigation wraps up or however salt or not and bought the White House was in ... whomever they talk to\nIt is to a handful of Republican and Democratic senators and decided they thought it was fair enough and they've made very clear he mentioned over the past couple of days\nThey want a fair investigation\nOr they're pulling out of the deal that to consider voting for kept an eye as soon as this week\nSo amber I have a I'm a\nBit of a not a conspiracy theory but a theory because it involves um again majority leader Mitch McConnell for whom the Senate\nIs um must be protected at all costs\nSo if if it if it's a flawed process one that does not earned the vote of ... and ... particularly Collins Collins and Murkowski and flake in order to confirm judge Kavanaugh his nomination goes down the Republican Party base is enraged\nAnd that gets them to come out and potentially help save\nOr or at least preserve the Republican majority in the Senate am I going too far in my thinking here\nWell when I'm\nOn the opposite side of what would have okay in the right we're all trying to guess right here is cabinet doesn't get confirmed because how do Republicans go back\nHome to voters and say we controlled all of Washington and there was a slam dunk Supreme Court the that would have sealed the conservative majority and totally messed up and we don't have that anymore [noise]\nOkay I can I can I can see that ... will push them to the side [laughter] or knows we will be\nWhat is happening with with the deputy attorney general now\nYeah he seemed to have gotten out of the cross hairs of President Trump for the moment I'm President Trump saying wait until after the mixture which is what he seems to have done with a lot of controversial decisions over at the Justice Department including\nWhether he left the top guy turned eight general Jeff Sessions go a\nHouse Republicans as sort of picking up that mantle for the president do they want to interview Rosenstein and talk to them about whether he tried to wiretap\nThe president or get cabinet official to impeach the president um and that real danger for Rosenstein because House Republicans a group of than it already filed impeachment articles against him\nOr is it possible that the president could and maybe he has cooled down and could convince House Republicans to cool their jets when it comes to Rod Rosenstein\n[noise] you know that's a great question I watched the token poll closely between President Trump and his allies in the house and in the end his allies in our team to win out of there was a battle recently over whether\nThe Justice Department should give over information about an hour and they had and Trump with sort of no I don't know I don't I don't know we should release that\nIt has to Republican Christian and Trump\nEssentially made them turn it over ...\nDid I miss that I leave anything out amber [laughter] so much has happened has happened today and I'm\nLike oh my goodness well you're going to get into the old gender debate later in the show which I'm looking forward to hearing in fact\nWe are going to do that right now ... with the Washington Post thanks very much for being on America on the line\nThank you for joining me now to focus on

host of WNYC if the United states of anxiety and from Washington Republican strategist Sam Donaldson and we're taking your calls at ... for for seven four or five\nEight to five five to ... in bed sty thanks for calling in\nThanks for having me when I saw the Kavanaugh performance of what's really offended but not at all five on the east who say that kind of behavior from people like him\nAnd uh [noise] I thought that the president if he's giving you or what can they can when you have allegations of sexual assault you're in trouble because of the man\nPhoto does not stand for president of the United states is the land of the driver of the United states\n... not going like Laura ... the bar let me ask you a question do you do you think\nThat um if judge Kavanaugh were not a white male that he would be able to give that forty five minutes straight\n[noise] uh last there's [noise]\nWell I'm based on how Tom Clancy just jump right yep yep yep yep yeah I think though aren't yet they're pecking order\nAnd men are higher in the pecking order than women are period\nAren't to bar I thank you very much for for calling in from ... uh Brett ... in Rogers, Arkansas thank you for calling in to\nAmerica on the line\nI think forever but the truth or conversation we'll see what I did you move clay or at least for myself I have three boys is twenty five your age group [noise] this is something that probably their criminal could rule\nRoutinely that this is on the top of their mind falsely start there is a lot of drama that it's\nBetter than four or five as someone was able to agree with and who knows who's feelings Emma get hurt who knows what the better because they are constantly having to respond to accusations nothing like this but as far as sexual\nIssues like that but just slight allies of back stabbing and it's it's it's just the finals that age group a lot of places it's yes our son's feel targeted they feel like they could be justifiably accused of a lighter\nAnd rubber ... is it to send them\nSome civil the others you know this is a problem that has nothing to do is to build the school longer to you know the Kurds civility to others longer heritage you get that\nCan do with the ... they have Brent can I ask you a question when you say you're having your position with your with your three sons they age Eighteen twenty five and they're saying that they are ... are they specifically saying that they are afraid of being accused of sexual assault or do\nThey feel targeted just for you know\nMicro aggressions or thing things like that that don't rise nearly two that kind of level\nI I'd say a little bit of both hey they feel targeted by do I know lots of listeners out there is but they are all white men\nYes they feel targeted at the very least they feel\nThat they're being pushed down where I feel a little propped up\nYou know so there's a little choose our generation that we'll white men were pushed up and we had a opportunities that others have though they're being pushed down and targeted articles and it's on the front of their minds out socially\nAbout how to behave but\nThey've had offered she's able to Paris where\nAt nothing that they have good just because of the rumors start tapping into social media runs wrap it was something they can't even defend the also it's comment more common that we want to believe that that age group and all those people are up brand I become legislators\nRent I Want to thank you very much for calling into America on the line Brett was calling in from Rogers, Arkansas Brent gave us a lot to [laughter] to think about there and that gets to the bigger question that I wanted to ... or bigger topic I wanted us to discuss in that is\nAs Brad was talking about there's there is a swath of the American electorate that feels like Brett and Brett's sons and they're going to be going to the polls in thirty something days and the president given what he said and given Brett Kavanaugh's a performance last Thursday\nIs this really a thing have we hit a cultural moment where where straight white aggrieved men are going to view this moment as they're rallying cry to show up at the polls\nWhether or not they show up at the polls is is one question but I mean I don't I think we shouldn't rush too quickly passed\nThe the meat is the thing that Brett is talking about because I had heard versions of that repeatedly and reporting on the United states then finally when we've been talking to to Trump supporters and to\nSort of alienating white people in general and um and the problem is that there are ... there there are more than one things have one thing happening at the same time one you know there are not\nAh these questions about accusations whether they'd be false or not a\nExist outside of a world we we don't have a world in which we have actually created systems for dealing with sexual harassment and so everybody all of us\nHave anxiety about it that Israel because we have done a terrible job of creating systems for dealing with sexual harassment period and if we actually had systems in place nobody would have to feel anxiety about false accusations are true accusations 'cause there'd be a system set up for dealing with it\nAnd so that's one set of conversation that we should be having as a society but we can't have it in society because we have the president in the United states and one of the major parties or one of the two major parties using a megaphone to to to rile up\n... this this white male ... identity politics or white male agreements that makes it impossible to have a an intelligent and useful conversation about what what do Brett sons and he\nYou know and and how can ... fund thrive in and actually pro plural society\nElected I I I I Want you to also to get in on this but I have to go to to to Sam to get your perspective um one as a Republican but also as the white male on this panel\nWell I think that's going to be the year the woman frankly at the ballot box and whether or not word of it up so little Lola society if we can always wake up the day after the election that will tell us\nA lot mhm what about okay go ahead Sam\nThough but I mean I you see white suburban women as an example of left this guy drove you\nWe always usually these posters all the time talking about generic ballots which for your listeners is\nYou know would you vote for a Democrat or Republican for Congress for getting anything else just straight partisanship and you know you see these numbers now bad around with his public polls of aids per se at high levels ... hot single digits low level it is\nOur eyes Sam dawson's high rise elections Grinnell thank you very much for being here when we return we'll hear from a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter about how when and why the Russians began to interfere in the twenty sixteen election stay tuned\n[noise]\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[noise] just\nKind of started in K part and you're listening to America on the line from WNYC and public radio stations across the country every night we hear from you our listeners in response or questions\nLast night long after the show it ended we got calls on our voice mail answering the question what can we all do as individuals to bridge the partisan gap dividing our country here's a sample\nShame factor and I'm calling from Redondo Beach California and I'm calling from Los Angeles I'm calling from Sacramento, California from Burbank the\nTopic was how we could possibly make politics testify to a woman she went to her parents and the parental log on to walk out\nOf the California DISCLOSE Act which shows in medical honors drawn out in the noisy initiate campaign finance reform you could pause on your yard and paying for the middle is not empowered that's kind of thing and also there's a petition\nIt like they have in other countries I think that all the politics to the real issues\nRussian hacking\nBlack males secret meetings at Trump Tower in this still unanswered question of collusion these are the subjects of the Russia investigation and the story of how Russian President Vladimir put and tried to undermine American democracy it's a story so complicated so nuanced that journalists then investigators have yet to get to the bottom of it\nBut you've gotten close few I've gotten closer than Pulitzer Prize winning reporter\nGreg Miller he covers national security for the Washington Post and his new book delve into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen presidential election it's called The Apprentice Russia a Trump Russia and the sub sub in the ... version of American democracy and I spoke with him earlier today\nGreg Miller welcome to America on the line thanks very much so the title of your book is a play on the reality television show that citizen Trump made famous but how are you using the moniker The Apprentice your new book [noise]\nWhile you're right so it's it's the name of the show that propelled him to such great fame I think that it works on a couple of other levels you know obviously he came into the White House pretty unprepared for the job never held public office before\nI'm needed a lot of kind of um staff and expertise around him to function in the job and even then it looked pretty clunky at times\nAnd then of course there's this other aspect to it ah this this survey ... that are characterized as his relationship to poop or seems to [noise] uh and so you know he's he's an apprentice president in some ways\nSometimes he seems to behave as if he's in a print just putting that seems to be his model that is who he often that's the way he admires and sometimes it's we emulates\nHow does that ... that admiration for the Russian President how does that go over with the\nNational security community that you cover and have been covering for years\nThat's a really great question and I think that the reality is that\nThis this is a schizophrenia administration you have a head of state and the president who believes one thing about Russia ah who rejects most of what his advisors tell him about Russia let alone what all of U.S intelligence agencies have concluded about Russia [noise]\nUh but you have this whole separate 'em entertaining I mean he would call it the deep state but it's not that deep I mean I think these are his many of them are his advisors who worked closely with him in the White House\nThey see it completely differently and they do their best to try to minimize the harm or to try to keep the Russian policy uh on makeup resemble what it has been a through our recent history\nCannot withstand a president who is bucking um decades' worth of practice can't can that ah other part of American government withstand a President Trump\nYou know that is the big test a lot of the the institutions of government are undergoing I'm an enormous stress test right now I'm In the White House with this president and I think it's an unanswered question so far I think that um\nWe don't really it's hard to know what the what the damage to these institutions might be beyond Trump's term however long that ends up being\nI think that the Justice Department and the FBI or under particular stress and you could point to a areas where they are holding it together and doing well right the Mueller investigation has racked up all of these indictments had had made a\nThat Russian interference was real and yet you know Trump is doing everything he can can much of the time to discredit the FBI as an institution to make it look like it is politically motivated um any surface some real stuff right there have been problems that he has that have been exposed to all of this drama\nUm such as well the the tweet the texts between these FBI agents and so forth\nThey kind of I'm In ... the the the drama around McCabe a former FBI deputy director I'm Around the uh Rosenstein and his you know impulse is two to four to wear a wire and meetings with the president you know this is weird stuff\nIt goes it goes hand in hand with the Trump presidents\nDo you do you believe that um deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in the story that um that's been out there\nThe pushback has been Rosenstein was joking but the reporting is he wasn't joking where do you where do you land on that\nMy sense and I write about this in the book I don't write about um his proposal to wear a wire but what I Do write about in the book is how um\nHow disturbed she seemed about I'm sort of emotionally\nAfter what happened in the ... in his hand in it how he was used right the White House makes this decision Trump makes this decision to fire James Comey but then tens that decision on Rod Rosenstein is deputy attorney general\nHe writes this memo that the White House points to it says this is why we're taking the step Rod Rosenstein says he is a terrible FBI Director\nRosenstein in the in the aftermath of that is just aghast he sees his reputation he built up over decades in the department just going up in flames and his reaction or in this in this moment\nUm he'd behaving a bitter radically at times he's sending messages to colleagues that make them concerned about his emotional uh wellbeing\nAnd so I I kind of think that he I I tend to believe that this did happen that he does propose it in a serious way he sees this as a crisis right um uh and he uh he um\nHe was deeply troubled about where they were this was all heading and that's why in the book and I was right about\nThat sets in motion his decision to secretly hiding from the White House hiding it from the attorney general sessions his decision to bring Bob Mueller and and give them the job of special counsel\nThe crisis I'm that Rod Rosenstein finds himself in the nation finds itself in now you start off the book and you were prologue\nUm goes back to August twenty sixteen\nAnd it involves then CIA director John Brennan\nAnd at a place within the CIA called Russia house what is Russia house and what did he discovered there that was so significant that he called up then chief of staff Denis McDonough and said I Need to get in to see the president", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Madison", "day": "03"}
