Soviet let's hear what he had to say about the global opinion writer\nFor the best of our knowledge to show is not a United States is that right or is that a permanent resident okay\nWe don't like John we don't like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to me\nSo it's it sounds like we're we're hearing that I'm Congress is is stepping up in\nTrying to be a check on the executive in this regard is anyone talking about the fact that the leader of the free world is not taking a stand on\nFreedom of the press which the United states has always been a beacon of light um when it comes to that in standing up for democracy [noise]\nYou know not especially but we should not be a surprise considering a their track record our president has had\nWhen it comes to [noise] uh respecting the press um [noise]\nHe has not been why who has consistently or advocated for journalists being able to hold their governments accountable or even you know building with American citizens and as as you saw as you heard of that cell by his first priority\nAmerican or not and that seems to determine how interesting he was in his uh safety and\nHis ability to write what he should be able to write as a member of the press\nBut something that's very important for people to pay attention to and we have an article in the Washington Post about this\nIs that Donald Trump is a long standing business ties with Saudis Saudi government's boost to his hotels since he came into office he certainly benefits from a positive relationship with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd some of his critics and or and even some of his supporters certainly believe that is shaping how seriously he is or is not taking\n'em efforts to find out what has happened to them all\nI'm a CNN is reporting that President Trump's legal team is preparing answers to written questions provided by special counsel Robert Mueller and this is according to the sources familiar with the matter\nSo this notion that Bob Mueller would lay low between Labor Day and election day\nI'm is not proving is not proving out is it\n[noise] it is and and and no one really should have expected him to you I mean he is so focused on this has been dividing up providing so much attention\nTo this issue or since he's been put in this position I was talking to someone working on his team earlier about this and uh they're moving forward at their pace are getting to the bottom of what they believe\nThe biggest issues are and or anyone talking about knowing for sure when this war wrap up its its just speculating about\nOkay I Want to turn to a Kanye West and you have to have Eugene ... and I just want to give the listeners who might not have heard the ten minutes to look we just a couple of samples here's one on ... and the alternative universe\nIs infinite amounts of universe and there's alternate universe so it's very important for me to get Hoover out because an alternate universe eye on him and I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago\nAnd then he talked about Superman\nMy dad and my mom's separated so I have a lot of mail energy in my home and also a very family that I'm\nNot a male energy doing all that useful\nBut we're you know and that's how you know I\nI Love everyone right but the cats\nGuy they didn't get to see that all the time like a\nIt was something about when I put\nOff and make you feel like Superman\nHe also used a number of choice words not safe for work or family listening I I I Want to bring in this part of the discussion Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham University but Christina Eugene what was that I\nI think unfortunately it's a display of a man who's suffering from some sort of break down and if you go back and listen to his first album he has become the antithesis of what he said\nThat he ever wanted to be um I think what's really really troubling also you know in that Superman description he's describing perfectly toxic masculinity he's leaning why so many men couldn't bring themselves to vote for someone like Hillary Clinton\nAnd you have in the oval office one of the most sacred places I Would argue\nFor our American democracy with two men who don't understand or respect the role of the presidency as evidenced is Trump in\nLast ... sitting in the office dropping profanity and you know I Know a lot of people are trying to dismiss them oh he's just ... we know that many rappers or some of the most intelligent word Smith of our generation that's not on that's not debatable here but it clearly isn't on display we have a man who unfortunately has cast his lap\nAnd sold his soul to be with Donald Trump unfortunately is going to be on the wrong side of history and I think it does harking back to ... him in the J word so many years ago and both of them being from Chicago and he never being able to get over\n... Eugene can you talk about the political significance of what happened in the oval office today [noise]\nAbsolutely I wrote about it for the fix a Donald Trump\nOr it's genuinely convinced that are aligning himself with ... will improve his ally with black voters or Fox News earlier today he said that his approval rating with black voters went up twenty five percent since ... has been vocal and support for Trump\nThe truth is a black support for Trump is never even been twenty five percent much less gone up twenty five percent\nOf the reality here is that uh we have a president who has it made it to having a soft spot for entertainers and celebrities and people who are famous because he views them as a culture sabers which they are however most black people do not take their political views from entertainer ... much less\nHip hop artist much less skyway west and so it would be in the best interest of the precedent to know that ... does not speak for black Americans coyote wet speaks for ... a west but it may be difficult for the president to know this because he doesn't have\nAny senior black people and his team who could inform him of the issues that matter most to black Americans and how they go about choosing which politicians feedback\nEugene Scott from the Washington Post thanks for coming on America on the line\nThanks for having me\nLet's turn now to the real possibility of major voter suppression on November ... started getting the most headlines now comes from Georgia\nWere fifty three thousand voters have had their registrations put on hold the secretary of state Brian Kemp he led the effort to enact a new law called exact match which requires that if there's any difference between the voters id and his or her name on their application no matter how tiny the application is held\n[noise]\n\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday October nineteenth\n[noise]\nLet's wait wait wait don't tell me give you what you've always needed a break from the news astronaut Scott Kelly tells us why you need to double check your eminent as when floating in space and he found coal reveals for most challenging role monster can we hear often go be terrible thing of the exploding lasagna bitter said will join us for a mini vacation for your soul and the news quiz\nFor men pee on Saturday morning at nine and Sunday at noon on the ideas network [noise]\nWisconsin Public radio is the surface of the Wisconsin educational communications board and the University of Wisconsin Madison with additional financial support from the corporation for public broadcasting and from listeners too the Wisconsin Public radio association\nSupport also comes from Madison country day school and independent pre K through grade twelve college preparatory school fostering a lifelong love for learning in smaller class sizes open house November tenth Madison country day dot org\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I tell the story of law were after\nA shooting at our school we could get a loser I'm a Twain way up the Miami Heat I'm the one ... on our website the amount of people that are registering to vote ...\nAnd it's really just a matter of years we were on a covered by mine because we were on the covers of all the sports pages and it was really showing that we have to hit people with ... you know hard to just have\nThose conversations and do it on there that that voting get out the vote ... of Michelle Obama hold on to them\nA lot of people go because of course it's the former first lady she she was a very public figure that people like to find if you are already in that world if you are and all they do you like to see that won't show up in ...\nThe celebrity does play a factor we saw that\nUm was that this week the time has it's now just melt together I don't remember ever Taylor Swift was this week or if that was last week but when she put on Instagram that you know telling people that they should vote for um bread is in in Tennessee\nThere was a huge spike as a boat dot org ... a a hundred and sixty six thousand people\nA signed up with forty two percent of registering falling between the ages of Eighteen and twenty four um did you see 'em a march for our lives any kind of Taylor Swift effect for you I Know that happened when are we on a a ground day\nI'm was with you guys have march for our lives\nAre are already on the ground they shut down our website eleven up [laughter] [laughter]\nSo so like celebrity not endorsements but celebrities support is crucial\nWell it's interesting because it's\nIt's not necessarily the perception of celebrities at least we use the term influence there because when you're trying to engage young people in a way that they'll actually find pretty interesting and find the stain of all he has to do it in a way that young people understand and oftentimes we're not going to really be enraged by a lot of the different methods that have been used before but when you're using these people that we oftentimes let's\nToo in social media in our actual immediate all throughout our daily lives\nThat's when you can really get them interested when you're showing somebody that they relate to and that they connect you on a level like this that they are oftentimes following because they are celebrity but because they aren't influence or they're\nGoing to be more engaged and it's just about speaking the language of the people that are trying to reach and I think that's I mean I think for a long time\nSo I'm a ... we have a dilemma and Ryan some young people who we reached out to the talk to them a across the country about whether they're registered to vote and if so what are they going to do one of those is DJ Lacey calling\nIn from Massachusetts but is from West Virginia DJ thank you for calling into America on the line\nI thank you so much for having me tonight I'm Glad to be here\nSo am I right you're an independent who votes Republican\nI Am I'm a registered independent um I actually voted off the first time in the primary in may and West Virginia and I voted in the Republican primary\nAnd I'm ... in the the the Senate race that's happening that's happening right now Marcy versus mention um where are you following or you are you going to go for the Republican candidate\n\nCertainly been a very interesting race you know if you look in West Virginia on President Trump won by around forty two points so when when you look at the state you would think that you know a Democrat could never have a chance to win a statewide election\nFor being with us on America on the line and thank you for your activism listeners when we come back we want to hear about your experiences with voting have you ever had a problem voting or maybe you've never voted tell us why not call us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nThis is the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio you're listening to America on the line a special from WNYC as it happens we'll be back on friday October Nineteen\nAnd sometimes on ask me another are contestants are wrong\nOther times they're so wrong there right [noise] courts\nStraight illustrated as funny as\nJoined me here Eisenberg on NPR's our of the president's word games and trivia\nSaturday morning at ten on the ideas network [noise]\nSupport for WPRI comes from the children's hospital of Wisconsin foster care program\nTo helping thousands of Wisconsin foster kids connect with caring families\nMore about being a foster parent is at the age W. dot org slash T.

that we've been talking\nAbout voting this hour we want to hear from you have you ever had a problem voting tell us what happened and and if your vote counted in the end call us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five if you never vote and don't plan to this year\nTell us why ain't for for seven four or five talk\nOf course registration doesn't matter if voters don't vote so let's get into the question of turnout\nJoining me now from Washington is Derrick Johnson president of the N. double ACP they've launched a new initiative to get black voters to vote and to stay politically engaged particularly African American women and back with me is Fordham political ... political science professor\nChristina Greer welcome to you both to America on the line thank you thank you for having me so\nAnd quote back to you something you wrote in a an opinion piece you wrote in essence magazine that came out yesterday you wrote it is clear that this nation's voting system wasn't built for us\nForeign listeners who who may not know what what this looks like for for black folks can you please explain what you mean what you mean by this with a system of\nVoting in this country was built for aristocratic white males or was not created for for participation of African American and that fact for white women\nAfrican American men have the right to vote for white women had the right to vote although there were aggressive efforts to suppress to write\nA to exercise a vote by after America's particularly in the south so the system was not built for us to participate\nBut you know just like Langston Hughes wrote a poem in Nineteen thirty six or America will be the America that we dream of because we're going to participate to ensure that all citizens are treated with protection under the law\nThen you also saying that and that ... that African Americans or can can make it meaning the voting system work for us what are some of the way to end up ... pie is hoping to make the system or work as it should for black people were you\nUnderstand the history of voting of this country particularly for African Americans uh up until Nineteen sixty five we were denied a large part the right to exercise or\nThe vote even though we we had it on paper there were so many laws to suppress the vote or in the American south\nFor then double ACP and many of our partner organizations at the time oh there was an aggressive effort that led to the signing of the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act and in that act it requires certain jurisdictions to get pre clearance to change the rules of engagement\nAre because we knew you can have the right on paper but if you put both suppress of measures in place it would deny a by and large large a number of people the right to vote\nFor then double ACP our goal is one to fight against in a vote suppression methods to to make sure individuals know when the vote is to take place how they can exercise that right\nAnd I understand that the choices that in front of them without us telling after America how to vote mhm\nSo I'm a resident Johnson I Want to go to Kayla who is calling in from East Tennessee Kayla thank you very much for calling into America on the line have you ever voted\nI have not now I'm very excited and all those care to\nYour very excited and you're scared to do so I get that right [noise]\nI yeah I Am not so much scared as doesn't tend to say that there's so much that I don't know that I Want to know I Want to make 'em an educated vote I Want to do um I Want to do what's right\nBy what I Believe um there's a lot of pressure I live in an area that's predominantly Republican and it's it's pretty apparent in our area that if you don't agree or things that uh the way they always fatty or ... or judge [noise] um and it yeah I found myself complaining about the way that things are\nYet I felt guilty because I've never been to that so it sounds like a lottery you know if you don't play you can't win and\nI felt an overwhelming sense of\nUh [noise] I guess responsibility and I feel like I and it's something I have to do\nWhat Kayla was there a particular issue or an incident that pushed you to go from never voting to thinking oh my God I have to vote [noise]\nIt's like everybody else is saying it was a a conglomeration of things that actually started in our local politics\nThat nominated year after year after year and that's the definition of insanity you know you you get the same people in office and want different results and of course they're not rendered I'm at work is doing the same thing and now I'm I'm almost thirty I'm a homeowner as things matter to me now [laughter] I didn't hear about taxes before I actually do now I have a daughter in elementary school at\nUm you know the board of education and and all those things are just being triggered and [noise] um I use triggered it in a way that you know it's you're going to my mind and I just I Want to do that\nTo my local civic duty and then you know I start watching the debate and I have to\nI have to get involved and the things that I agree with him don't agree with and our states\nKayla I Want to thank you very much for calling into America on the line Kayla was calling in from East Tennessee you should never voted before but she's going to\nIn twenty six days a week before it comes to Christina I'm going to go to Scott in in Washington Heights here in New York City Scott and welcome to America on the line Oh thanks for ... have you voted before I have\nVoted for most recently uh twenty six\nOh okay well that that counts that counts so what are you going to vote in the midterm\nUh [noise] the thing I'm having an internal debate with myself about whether or not I will explain I feel that in this may be cynical me to say that [noise]\nUm but I feel that\nWe really have the illusion of choice when it comes to choice in terms of choices that matter\nUh you know we can have Fifteen flavors of bagels so we are only two parties and our political system that I feel that\nA large percentage of Americans really don't have their interests represented in my mind I feel like there is an illusion of choice when it comes to significant political positions in this country\nScott and I want to thank you I Want to thank you very much for for calling and I want to bring in Christina Greer here boredom political science professor\nI uh\nUh where'd you gotten gotten just blew my blew my mind they're given the two years that we've been through this idea that like there's there's no difference is is is astounding to me but\nYou talk about what the the calls we just heard but also the the effort that the N. double ACP is trying is undertaking\nTo ensure that African Americans that only registered to vote\nBut stay active and vote right and I think that that registration pieces key right because we know that participation is a two step process it's registering and then turning out to them but before I answer to delve into that\nI I think with Caitlin scatter saying are actually a little similar\nRight both of them are not full participants in\nThe electoral process keep mine Scott vote in twenty sixteen we had municipal elections all throughout twenty Seventeen that's right right right mayor and city council in public advocate and comptroller I mean people who control our lives in a very visceral and local level and they control right away and very direct way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Madison", "day": "12"}
