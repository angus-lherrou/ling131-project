T. L.\nSo about that nightmare scenario I mentioned earlier\nNow what if the election really isn't over next Tuesday night what if there are so many disputed results ballot challenges runoffs and slow vote counts that were left with a cliffhanger\nIt happens take the Norm Coleman al Franken's Senate race in Minnesota in November two thousand eight that election wasn't decided until\nJune thirtieth two thousand nine after every available court challenge was exhausted what should we be bracing for this time joining me from Washington is David Wasserman editor and cook Political Report and from Phoenix welcome back to have post senior political reporter Kevin robot lard\nKevin Dave both of you welcome back to America on the line\nThey chop them\nBack they let me start with you how likely is any permutations of the nightmare scenarios I laid out likely to happen [noise]\nWell it's it's certainly possible that we could emerge from election night not knowing it controls the house I think Democrats are a strong favorite for house control maybe Seventy to eighty percent odds foot on a good night for Republicans and wishing to carry out that fat\nOr Democrats or or certainly can't seem to have that on on the least worst night for Republicans are there could be some question as to uh several races that are very close a on the east coast in the mid west but also\nFederal races that might not be settled in California for several weeks personally I Love California slow vote counts because it adds to the drama but that fight the nightmare for party strategist who want to know who\nThe speaker will party strategist how 'bout that millions of Americans who want a definitive answer a election night so I'm sort of anticipated what I was going to ask you in terms of\nOf slow voting where where it could we see slow voting half in California is notorious are there other parts of the country or other states where slow voting is just something that happens every two to four years for\n... vote to slow down to I guess you got to fix\nAbout a month to finalize a all of it's a male and vote returns and\nIt's counted up beyond a the election day takes a long time to determine factors and ... Democrats too fat or\n... in the votes that are counted after election day cigarettes are trailing in a handful of braces find election I fair or they could make up that gap Washington state is another place to look out for\n'em and Kevin one of the nightmare scenarios I rattled off was a run off ... what are the conditions that lead to a run off and of course I'm thinking of Georgia and Mississippi start with Mississippi some Mississippi Israeli where we would have\nSort of a nightmare scenario in this case we wouldn't know who ends up with control of the United States Senate\nAh Dave's nightmare scenario would have relied on a very good night for Republicans are relatively good night for Republicans there's no real way Republicans are very good night and the house or listen to rely on a pretty good very good night for Democrats and when it comes to the Senate\nIf Democrats are able to pick up maybe one seat and sort of hold onto their others control of the Senate could come down to a runoff in Mississippi likely between the Democratic candidate there who's a former congressman and agriculture secretary and your Mike Espy\nAnd Mississippi or incumbent senator a Cindy Hyde Smith\nThat wouldn't be decided until December that could be a real nightmare and knowing who control the Senate you'd also likely see just a ton of money and resources\nFrom both political parties poured into that state in an effort to determine control of the United States Senate or that said it is sort of an unlikely scenario again because it would run bubble really really good night for Democrats um that just doesn't look hospital considering how Republican tilted the Senate map as\nIn Georgia you could see one of the most contested um governors' races go to a runoff that's between Democrats Stacey Abrams in Republican Brian Kemp\nUm if neither one of them breaks fifty percent on election night that ... that race will go to our off\nAnd let me bring you back to to Mississippi one second before turning at my intention to to Georgia ... the race in Mississippi I'm Mike Espy versus the income than a ... this is a big deal because Mike as to be the Democratic um candidate\nHe shouldn't even be competitive in is in a red state like Mississippi no\nYeah it's it's a really interesting scenario um for all this to come up basically what happened is when a Republican senator Thad Cochran resigned earlier this year he triggered a special election which takes place under some sort of different rules than a typical a Senate election what in Mississippi\nPart of that is including the run off another part of that is that actually on the ballot there's no party registration listed so none of these candidates under Mike as we've name it does not say Democrats under Cindy Hyde Smith name it does not say Republicans\nThat really could end up making a different depending on how things break down\nThe reason this is likely to go to a runoff is because Cindy Hyde Smith\nIs also facing a challenge from within her own party from state senator Chris McDaniel he has sort of an arch conservative he was one of sort of Steve Bannon's warriors who do you remember back at the beginning of the Senate cycle we talk a lot about how bad it was gonna try to run challengers to all these incumbent Republicans\nLike Daniel was going to be one of those challengers he hasn't really raised the money that he expected to at this point it looks pretty safe based on pulling the SP and hide Smith will advance to the runoff but he's going to take away enough of the vote from Hyde Smith to make sure that neither candidate got ...\nPercent okay now now George and you laid out the possibility of a of a run off their one of the things that was we were talking about\nAll sort of blends together Kevin I don't know if it was last week or the week before where we were talking about the situation in Georgia with the um\nUh registrations that were being held fifty three thousand a voter registrations that were on hold\nAnd one of the things that came out was that whether your registration is on hold or not show up at the poll and polls and file a provisional ballot so talk about the difference between a provisional ballot and a standard ballet and how that I'm comes into play in terms of\nVote counting and whether we will we will that will add to the suspense or in Georgia and the Georgia governor's race\nYeah so this could add to the suspense of whether they wouldn't even be a rough ride on what happens here ... is basically used when there's some question about whether or not a voter lovable about\n'em and virtually all states under sort of a help America vote act which was passed back in two thousand two after the recount in the presidential election in Florida\nUm the voter can cast a provisional ballot or almost all the time\nSo it varies sort of under what conditions you would cast one and the thing is many of these ballots can be\nA challenge in some places it's contingent upon the boat or to provide proof that they are relatively ... sort of after the fact so there's really lots of complicated way and uh that this happens it's very easy to see in a situation in Georgia where there's a lot of questions about how camp is handling\nThis election because he is also the secretary of state to state street elections officer\nIt'd be very easy to imagine a scenario where there's lots of provisional ballots cast perhaps and perhaps lots of challenges to ride\nA so when we started the show I asked listeners to call in to say whether they would be voting their fears this election day and six days or their hopes eight four four seven four or five eight to five five and mark calling from Missouri mark ... welcome to America on the line hopes their fears\nHolds for go on for\n\n\n\nYou're listening to America on the line from WNYC as it happens returns in its entirety on friday November

I\nWould love your reaction to I'm hearing the president said he's going to say Fifteen thousand troops\nThink that's more troops than we have in Iraq right now um I mean I I'm thinking actually about morale I'm I tweeted this morning I said we are you know there will be black and brown people who speak English going to the border to keep black and brown people who speak Spanish\nFrom becoming black and brown people who speak English and Spanish\nHe's the only difference between the people who are going to be down at the border and those who are coming I'm you know the the few thousand people who were desperate [noise]\nUm is that they speak a different language but they basically you know they're going to look alike and there are Latinos and African Americans in their majority will probably be at that border [laughter]\nUm so it's a very strange site um but but I think it's it's also we have to keep it in context I'm very concerned about the way the mainstream media has kind of played this is a kind of a horse race I'm really kind of a again this whole thing on a narrative that that basically that that Trump has um has\nHas done created this is not an invasion\nFlooding uncontrollably that is not true I'm pleased with to keep it in context that the people of Central America as a whole are several million people\nAnd these are maybe three thousand four thousand people at this point um that are the most desperate people the most absolutely desperate people who thought that they could be protected by coming in this way because it's a dangerous missions in many ways they're making a smart decision by saying I'm not going to do this alone I'm going to go with others\nAnd yet they're being met with a huge political dynamic they I'm sure many of them were not even aware\nOf before I turn to the fourteenth amendment I Do want to go back to to um the calls because I asked people to call in to on this Halloween to say if they're going to vote their fears or their hopes aid for for seven four or five eight to five five um let's see\nWe've got a call from New York and I'm calling from Ohio let's go to let's go right here in the borough of Manhattan here in New York City and pick up allies are Eliza thanks for calling into America on the line\nUm hello Hi I'm I'm Eliza mhm [noise] um I'm twelve years old and I and my greatest fear for the midterm elections is that people will go out and vote\nThat they want yeah\nAre you worried about this like I'm I'm kind of in love with the lives of right now here twelve years old and you're thinking about the midterms and you have an emotional reaction to this like where does this come from life yeah\nWell I I'm I'm twelve I obviously don't get to vote 'em\nAnd I feel like other people that are of the age to vote they should get that chance and get the chance to speak their mind and vote because in the two thousand six cheat election a lot of people didn't vote which means a lot of like\nOh like\nThis even if you don't think it does it concern you like like your country this is your life your president and like you said get to choose\nAnd lines that I'm so in twenty six gene when Donald Trump was elected president universe hands\nUm and so I Would like to know just as a young person um he is president of the United states everything and it seems that you are very aware how how has his presidency and how he has um performed and behave as president how has\nDemocrats Republicans independents give us a call eight four four seven four or five eight to five five this is America on the line [noise]\n\nYou're listening to America on the line from ... in my see as it happens returns in its entirety on friday November second\n\nOn wait wait don't tell me we invite accomplished people on our show to answer the truly difficult questions their reaction is refreshing the next time you have questions like that and match somebody um [noise]\nLeast we try wait wait don't tell them the news with us from NPR's\nSaturday morning at nine and Sunday at noon on Wisconsin Public radio\nWhen you listen to Wisconsin Public radio you're enjoying the results of membership support\nFifty four thousand members helped make this unique radio service possible\nYou can learn more about WPRI and all of our programs by visiting WPRI dot org WPRI connects you to the people in Wisconsin and around the world you hear many perspectives and civil conversations every day and you may even learn a few things along the way\nWisconsin Public radio brings you thoughtful conversations and the latest news thanks for listening\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I think they have a shot at this\nWhat will you know and as to your point during the rally just before going on the air the president asked\nYou told everyone you know it's important for you to get out there and vote in fact you can vote now how many have you voted raise your hand\nAnd everybody raised their hands and he even said wait you've all voted it's a hundred percent why am I here and he throws his hands and walked around the states can you do what was the mood like in the room was that an electric moment during that rally\nIt was up but you know I mean the people who come to the things they want that they want to be entertained the thick of it more as a a\nProfessional wrestling event than a political thing right that's what they come here they they know they're supposed to boot CNN and hate on the media and and then share when the good guys have done the things that they do you know Trump bragging about his victory so I wouldn't worry too much into that\nUh and if you are so interested in politics you're going to come to one of these things you probably have already voted by mail if you're older and Florida that's what you tend to do or at one of these early vote and stuff that you know ... it's\nLike a good percentage perhaps even half of the vote is going to be and before election day\nCan I ask a question were there did you see I Know that at these rallies we've become accustomed to seeing a lot of red hats I'm beginning to pick up a lot of green hats did you see them\nGo get the er at the Trump rally just now I I did not what are you know we're not growing as to whether it's a good bye\nOh okay but my sense is is that the green hats are are tied to Pepe the frog ah and I didn't know sadly that um you know in a low key essentially white supremacist right yeah\nI can be I've not the those and I've been to several over the last few months are both on my own like tonight as well as part of the White House full and I'm frankly have not seen that\nSharif I'm tired of the folks who are at the rally tonight would you say that they are they are more dissent as voters or Rick Scott voters or are they Trump voters are they there\nBecause President Trump is there and Trump is there a guy and the census and and Scott or just ancillary figures\nYeah let's put it this way a rod status is lucky if he can get like fifty or sixty or a hundred people for one of the vets are rich Scott has not been campaigning Michael ... he has that excuse but let's Fort Myers Fort Myers is like red tide central\nTheme is where the toxic algae came from the lake Okeechobee and make make life miserable continues to add is really hurting the business so Rick Scott was run out of his own rally\nOr back in in uh in August and September so he he had trouble if that's part of the state I'm I'm sure he came in by motorcade so he's very fine leaving but I doubt he would've had anywhere it's kind of reception it had not been for Donald Trump ... they could they were here for Donald Trump they're\nHere for the show there for the entertainment\nOr ride Sharif Dante has political reporter thank you very much for hustling and um they get calling in to the show down there in Fort Myers Florida where President Trump ended moments ago for a rally\nFor a Rick Scott who's running for Senate governor Rick Scott and for round the census the former Republican congressman who's running for governor against Democrat Andrew Gillum who is also the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida Michigan thank you\nFor your thanks for having me\nAnd a back with me as you as you heard from the question that she asked me you know ... and Kevin ... is also still with us Kevin thank you very much for for a hanging on there you know um one thing I wanted to to bring up before I go real quickly back to calls\nAnd that is sort of the question I\nAsked should region that is how helpful is it to Republicans\nTo have the president on the campaign trail whether he's campaigning for them as a church that this is great for the census and Scott\nBut what about those Republicans running in purple districts for whom even though the president's not they're campaigning for them and speaking of Republican candidates the fact that the president is out there talking makes their lives more difficult\nKevin yeah it's it's interesting one thing on though is uh CNN reported earlier today that in Trump's final rally schedule the Trump White house actually decided not to send Trump\nTo either Arizona or Nevada or in fears that the more likely hurt Dean Heller unorthodox Sally than he would be to help them which I think is a fairly good indication", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "01"}
