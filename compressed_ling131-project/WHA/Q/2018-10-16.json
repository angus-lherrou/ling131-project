Emily Hi amber thanks for joining America on the line tonight\nI\nAm or we all know how Trump has said putting denies involvement in the twenty sixteen election as ... as a credible source and maybe it was a four hundred pound hacker sitting on his couch and since that's been affected for him I guess listen to the similarities\nWith what he said this morning about the evidence that the Saudi Government had killed your colleague ...\nFirmly denied any knowledge of it he didn't really know maybe I don't want to get by but it sounded to me like maybe they\nWere gonna try getting to the bottom of it but it was a flat denial\nFlattened NATO who knows the ambush sound familiar\nYeah you're exactly right it hair long chunk of anything three years now white on whether Russia meddled in the two dozen sixteen election day he told CBS lightly all you know Russia they now I think China metal to\n'em and much more domestically we've seen the president in\n... in Oregon accused of eating badly the benefit of the doubt even when others in his party don't want to stand by that I'm thinking in particular Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race that Republicans walk last year and a good question\nGoing to get anyone he wants to stand by the benefit of the doubt take them at their word the question again it why\nEmily actually [laughter] yeah well what do you think\nOh I'm Sorry the question for me not to drive yeah I was going to transition there but then you gave me such an interesting Marshall to follow up on\n[laughter] right right yeah I it depends on the situation is very clear in the examples that followed more closely here at home of men accused of behaving badly in his orbit when people are politically beneficial to him he wants to stick with those people he doesn't want to drop\n'em diplomatically I see\nA similar mindset in terms of him thinking of\nDiplomacy is relationship\nHe always talked about how much she likes Xi Jinping and China invite them or we can get along in in Mexico the incoming president you they liked each other and it's all about like the kind of surface level relationship and so I'm Wondering if that had something to do here with\nHis inability to say no to strong men which you also said several times during the campaign you'd Myers\nEmily in fairness to Trump two things one\nThe Saudis can buy weapons from our adversaries China and Russia like Trump says if we cut off themselves as punishment\nFor this possible murder or some people are calling for maybe that's not the right to sanction and two American presidents for nearly a century less we forget our history our recent history\nHave been looking the other way while the Saudi Government commits all kinds of human rights atrocities\nMostly for the sake of cheap oil to support or consumer lifestyles so do you think Trump's totally up to the Saudis is different and he looked kind of an degree in any way [noise]\nI think in the green it's different though I think you're absolutely right try mine does have that history now there's a general reluctance on the part of American leaders to\nTo call the Saudi doubt on they've been useful to us and so I'm American leaders tend to have to be forced into taking an adversarial position towards Saudi Arabia that this is such a frightening and um\nYou know blatant disregard for human rights that I think Trump has felt at least somewhat on the defensive in the last few days and this whole looking of wrote killers which is an explanation that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut says that the Saudis themselves are trying to circulate\nYou know that sort of by the Saudi line we don't have any sense of ... about why he thinks that's a plausible accusation and I think he's very um committed and the past often successful and kind of floating these\nFairly implausible excuses for people doing what looked like to be really terrible things and the uncertainty itself right the kind of who knows that's such a ... with him then it becomes\nYeah one more unanswered question that people can make up conspiracy theories about\nAnd when he says maybe it was real killers that sounds implausible because it sounds like strangers whooping into the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nTo go after Mr ... but now we have reports from several news organizations that the Saudi Government itself was gonna say um this was an interrogation of ... gone bad\nAnd they weren't supposed to kill him and so ... the Saudis kind of in conjunction with Trump or setting some of their own people up to be for guys wrote killers\nThat's exactly right on your situation where Trump is giving the Saudis and a lot of wiggle room to try to get it\nSupport for WPRI comes from the history museum at the castle in Appleton gridiron glory the best of the pro Football Hall of fame and exhibit featuring stories about the racial integration of professional football my history museum dot org\n... search they released a video that ... a team of Saudi agents or you know of course which is down ... tried to capture the show so\nOn the on the other side of that you're Saudi Arabia trying to say exactly as you said it wasn't her Gawker and Trump is giving them so much room to to make that case\nLet's move to the Elizabeth Warren story and by way of background she has come under fire from Trump and others for putting down on a professional profile\nThat she has Native American blood she did that once upon a time to grow up in Oklahoma and says stop was family lore about some Indian heritage Trump uses of to argue she's a phoney and has challenged her to take a DNA test well guess what this morning senator one revealed she did say such a tough\nThe tester at Stanford University did not know whose DNA he was examining and there was apparently a Native American ancestor six to ten generations ago so here's part of the video\nThat Senator Warren released with the toaster Stanford University professor of biomedical data science and genetics Carlos boost a mentor\nAnd the hunger genome did five five segment from a\nTree with very high complement we believe zero rate is less more so now the president wants to call my mom a liar what are the facts [laughter] we have a Native American ancestry your\nCue the sentimental music I don't know if it's indigenous music or not but Emily what do you make of the scientific legitimacy of that test if you can make anything of it and what about the political implications for this potential twenty twenty presidential candidate\nI mean I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt that geneticist here since he sounds like he is um very well credentialed that knows what he's talking about and I don't know how DNA works\nAmber Phillips politics 'cause funding for the Washington Post

Bush won re election in a very close two thousand four presidential elections because Republicans put an anti gay marriage question on the ballot in the ultimate swing states a year of Ohio\nThe drove Republican turnout and Bush won by a hair so bell with questions matter times to Emily Bazelon from the New York times magazine wrote last month about the Florida ex felons question and she is still with us Emily ... background\nHow does that even become a thing in the United states of all the punishments for felonies large or small why did some states include losing your right to vote for the rest of your life\nThat's a great question the law that I'm permanently disenfranchised former felons started in the early Nineteen century in states like Connecticut and they seem to have been you know a kind of punishment maybe as sort of puritan idea of on continuing punishment\nBut they really take off um during reconstruction in the south\nAnd what we see there and it's really clear from the history is that as southern states were forced to give 'em black people to vote in order to re enter the union 'cause that was the terms for re entering the union\nThey also tried to reduce the political power of the same people who are getting the vote and one of their tools was to permanently disenfranchise you if you had a felony conviction\nUm the states in the south including Florida they pass those permanent disenfranchised bands and then they included crimes like petty larceny\nIn the meantime there are actually also rounding up a lot of African American former slaves for crimes like larceny I'm often without really any proof and they were putting these people in prison and then leasing them as laborers to plantations\nSo you see this sort of double blow here where you're both imprisoning lots of people who work for a million slaves and then using that as an excuse to take away the vote for them forever\nSo listeners will open up the phones on this one who among the things that a felony conviction should cost someone their right to vote for the rest of their lives rather than until they've served their time and who thinks otherwise give us a call from Florida or wherever\nAnd aid for for seven four or five talk aid for for seven four or five to five five\nAnyone want to tell your own story along these lines or that of a loved one or just your opinion if you've ever thought about it maybe if you've never thought about it and you're hearing this are you thinking yeah bad them for the rest of their lives or what people can vote for the rest of their lungs even after they've served their time\nAid for for seven four or five talk for for seven four or five eight to five for\nYour article says Florida alone has a quarter of all the disenfranchised villains in the U.S how did that come to be\n[noise] you know there are just all those people who get prison sentences and Florida and it's now the third biggest state\nAnd so what you wind up with our number showing up more than one point five million people are permanently disenfranchised and Florida um that's one in ten of 'em all voters and one in five African American voters so we're still seeing a kind of racial and balance in the impact that this law has\nObviously this is part isn't too or those ex felons disproportionately and demographics that would tend to vote for Democrats [noise] yes\nEight over this but it does seem like because I'm about thirty percent of them are African Americans and African Americans in Florida vote for Democrats at a rate of about Ninety percent\nThat there could be some part is an advantage to Democrats if this and then it passes but I should say that it's not totally clear because it's also possible that the people who've been out for a longer maybe more likely to register and vote and those people tend to be white and tend to register\nAt reasonably high rates as Republicans and independents\nSo it's possible that this is not going to be some you know huge a turn Florida blue\nTool and that you know the argument that people are passing the amendment want to make is that this is just a tool of citizenship it's like you know a debt pay that status paid people should be able to have a second chance and that\nVoting is tied to people feeling like full citizens and there is an interesting research suggesting that be getting the vote back may um correlate with people being less likely to re offend so it could also take that benefit into account and evaluating this amendment\nIn fact I've read that the rationale for only allowing white men who own property to vote at the founding of this country the property part was about the idea that you have to have a stake in the economic well being of the nation\nTo vote responsibly it's so the opposite of how we tend to think today right that the wealthy use their influence to shape the law law to hoard the well for themselves\nAnd so arguably nobody has more of a stake in the economic future of their communities to the than the many men who were convicted of felonies in the era of mass incarceration which might be ending is that to historically abstract for politics or anything like that getting shut in Florida\nI think you're right people are making these abstract arguments about citizenship and second chances and\nBelonging and I think one reason is you know tactical this amendment has to pass by sixty percent to become law in Florida because it involves amending the state constitution and they have the supermajority requirement for doing that\nBut I think there's also a kind of deeper commitment on the part of the you know most of the people who are leading the effort here are former felons themselves and I think they feel like there's something deeper at stake here about\nWho they are about you know recognizing that they've done their time and that they want to lead to a different kind of life and that they deserve to be part of picking on the elected representation for their communities\nLet's take a phone call Jason in St Louis you're on America on the line Hutchison\nThank you very much Emily ... from the New York

I'm Brian layer\nIn for Jonathan Capehart tonight and let's keep going on election day ballot questions\nGoverning magazine counts a hundred fifty four of them nationwide for November six we talked about two of them in some detail let's go down the list of some more of them more quickly now whether interesting and which candidate races they might also affect with us for this\nIs Candace Norwood reporter at governing magazine Candace thanks so much for joining us welcome to America on line Hi and thanks for having\nAnd listeners help us tell this story tonight on America on the line tell the rest of America about a ballot question in your state that you plan to vote on which way are you voting\nA hundred or I'm Sorry aid for for seven four or five talk eight for for still toll free for for seven four or five talk aid for for southern four or five eight to five five\nTell us about any ballot question in your state that you plan to vote on which way are you voting and was interesting was it important\nAid for for seven four or five talk\nLet's start Kansas with the um counter intuitive conservative referenda fucking call them the counter intuitive conservative in too liberal states that I mentioned briefly earlier in the show Massachusetts might repeal transgender rights\nYeah that's right [laughter] which is a bit surprising given that they've been kind of a pioneer and a number of ... plus I'm writes\nUm it's one thing to fight over adding new roads it's another thing to consider taking rights away who wasn't happy with the application of transgender rights in Massachusetts so\nUh and twenty sixteen the actual Republican governor Charlie Baker signed legislation that extended\nProtections to transgender individuals in public accommodations\nPublic accommodations include restaurants they include theaters parks on health care facilities but the real focus in this debate has been on a public bathroom access and a members of the G O P have used a\nWhite Democrats\nReferred to scare tactics and focusing on public bathroom access to 'em suggest\nThat women and children are in danger if someone pretending to be transgender war to enter a public bathroom for ... facility that doesn't align with the gender that they were assigned at birth\nSo transgender rights might go away if there's a ballot measure succeeds in Massachusetts and Oregon might repeal it's sanctuary states status\n[noise] yes so uh Oregon has the oldest a so called sanctuary state law a that was implemented in Nineteen eighty seven\nAnd obviously sanctuary laws have been a contentious topic and\nThe Trump Administration has actually taken legal action against states and cities that have implemented these policies so it'll be really interesting to see whether voters ah uphold these policies are if they'll repeal their\n... and do you happen to know I mean that's the hasn't elected a lot of Republicans lately\n[noise] yeah I personally haven't done extensive reporting on this my a colleague a gram vice was the one who really focused on this on our website\nUm but it is certainly a little confusing in terms of uh how a a blue you know seemingly progressive state like this came to uh have this on the ballot\nGoing in the other direction now that we've talked about conservative measures and liberal states kind of tell me about the Medicaid expansion questions and for red states Montana Nebraska Idaho and Utah all going to vote on basically expanding Medicaid as laid out an Obamacare\nYeah so our health care reporter Maddy ... has been following this more closely but just to give you an overview as you said these four states will be voting on whether to it\nOh which has been a central part of Iraq Obama's Affordable Care act\nBetter known as Obamacare um this is going to be really the first test for Medicaid expansion since congressional Republicans tried and failed to repeal it only one state so far in Maine has approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box\nLet's see what ballot measures some of our listeners are following in their states cruise in Madison, Wisconsin you're on America on the line Hey Chris\nI actually just voted today my name is a cruise what are they from Madison, Wisconsin and\nHey there early voting\nYes first day got my sticker on twenty three and I voted to a yes on ... on a ballot measure to make marijuana legal\nSo that's on the ballot or yes for recreational use\nI'm Sorry yes at the age of Twenty one\nRight Chris thank you very much let's go to Stefan and now we have to find your on and on the line\nThey should commit call I'm sort of just go ahead\nYeah just go ahead what's on the ballot in the white\nWell there's a measure that is a little conflicting for me it's to a surcharge on investment property is\nA it was originally geared for people who live out of state or out of the country and property is here [noise]\nFor investment purposes and then they pay rent them out or something like that is helping drive up the price of housing and it's supposed to be to fund education the sons are suppose to your markets earmarked for education\nThere are two problems with the bill though or at least one is that there's nothing that says the legislature cap reduce their general funds for education by whatever they take it off the transient or or on the investment tax\nAnd then the other is that it was originally written should be on property is worth over a million dollars [noise]\nUm that was removed in the final draft of the bill\nSo for all the people on the mainland whose eyes are blazing over in has just been ain't going what or who gets hurt by this that makes you leaning it sounds like you're against a ... you you want to do some measure\nAnyone who read south [noise]\nStefan thank you very much boiled it down to super ... at the end there and let's go to Elaine in St Louis Hi Elaine your automatic on the line\nElaine you there oh\nI'm Sorry Karen in Columbus ohio carrying around America on the line do we have ya\nYeah hello Hi there what's on the ballot\nLuck I Am voting for a state wide I issue line\nI it will reduce want are currently
