I'm Rob fair and\nComing up and moments where we the deadlines and pressure we often buckle down to get the job done but a new exhibit of mid century designers at the Milwaukee art museum suggest the best ideas are often found by making time for playing the curator of the new exhibit joined the show coming up\nFirst us representatives from both parties voted last week to pass a reauthorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration the bill would continue funding for the FAA but this year's version contain some new protections for airline passengers if the bill becomes law the FAA would be able to set a minimum standard for a seat side and leg room on planes\nAnd it would also prevent airlines apparently from forcibly removing passengers after the ... the boarding gate something they got national attention last year after managed dragged off United Airlines flight to make room for crew members\nDug with kid is the executive director of the national association of airline passengers Douglas welcome to central time\nThank you for having me well this at the reauthorization bill it's huge I I understand uh two thousand or so he does there's a lot in their blood key in on his leg room thing because this is a common a problem faced by ear travelers are things really getting more cramped over the years in the plains we fly on\nYes they are and it's not an accident the airlines have figured out that ah if for example they\nGo from say thirty four inches of leg room or see pitched to thirty one inches a sea of a of a sea fish\nThey can put an extra ruin the airplane for each ten rows they do that too so they say okay this is basically free money\nLet's put it in there and you know people will ah in most of the time just simply accepted as soon as it is but uh again it's not a a really a good thing for passengers because when if you're on a short flight\nOkay you can endure it but the longer the flight is the worst gifts and you know there is a potential for a harm to people from a blood clots and so forth\nSo in this bill passed by the house I think the Senate still has to weigh in on this or how would they regulate this issue of of leg room and and a pitch\nRight the um the Congress passes a law but then it's up to the um regular the FAA or DOT in this case to um create the regulation that enforces that particular part of the lawn for they do that they've got to go through their own set of hearings and studies and so forth so\nA while we are are glad that they are moving in this direction is something we asked the FAA on the ah to look into back in two thousand and fourteen uh we do not we're not we're not going to hold our breath on us because they're going to take their time they're going to study it\nThey may come out with something that says the effect that we don't see a problem with the existing standards and what our main concern would be would be they would say whatever it is right now is fine with us rather than taking the passengers point of view in saying thirty inches or last\nArchitect designed toys as well as playgrounds and play equipment and the last section of the exhibition focuses on corporate approaches so things that were embraced by corporations in the mid century that outlook playful and ...\nSome people might think back in the Nineteen fifties maybe the word conformity might popular had everybody's where he received suit you got cookie cutter houses but clearly people design world we're trying to do something different to you talk about that moment and and what the designers were doing\nYeah you've actually hit it on the head I mean one of the things that I like to talk about is you know the man and the gray flannel suit and that is exactly it right this kind of a margin is Nineteen fifties moments and there were a lot of architects and designers who were\nReally striving to get away from that and so this is what we've done in this exhibition as we've looked at um a number of these architect and designer is over forty of them who have tried to get away from this ... this\nSociety and moved towards something that was a little bit more ... playful a you know in order to get out get out solutions to encourage free play and there were a lot of kind of outcomes\nAnd as I understand that if I read this right there are some artifacts from that era but there's also some modern things inspired by that is that right\n[noise] no actually everything's in the exhibition is from the period so it's all Nineteen forties through the nineteenth through the late Nineteen sixties\nWith the exception of um we do have three play areas in which people are encouraged to walk in and uh actually play with things that were made yesterday which is why they are allowed to touch those things so I think maybe that's what you're referring to are these play areas\nAnd there's a philosophy here but I think you you are interested in and these designers word the idea that a good cool stuff to come out of of having fun with it instead of coming in with this sort of very serious approach yeah\nTotally so I think you know when people stop and think about what the what the furniture from the period looks like he might think about something that is um you know made of new materials or new technologies something like um the aims of plywood for example that seems pretty ubiquitous now but in the period\nIt really comes out of a lot of experimentation that they do and so in the exhibition we have\nA number of examples from the Ames is but one that I'll call your attention to is a small child chair so they made children's furniture in the late Nineteen forties\nAnd actually it was while they were experimenting with their full size plywood chairs that they decided to try to make the small scale children's furniture and so it really gets back at the at our central these\nOr play 'em it's possible for designers to come up with so many you know so many different kinds of pasta positive outcomes and through ... and you you really get at different um you know different objects\nYou mentioned that uses and as I understand it and some of these other designers who didn't just work on one kind of thing they weren't just I I Do chairs or I'd have a lot of more experimenting in a lot of different uh I guess mediums informs\nYet so we uh what's interesting is if you come to the exhibition you'll actually be able to see that so\nUh the angels are the kind of quintessential example feels the work from them that includes films and furniture and also toys for children\nAnd I think this is important because it really should get really it really shows people that architecture and design is not just you know a a kind of it's not just a singular discipline but in fact once you start blurring the boundaries you can do super interesting interesting things and it's not just the ... says um there were a number of designers that um that\nKind of that that worked across many different disciplines I think one great example is um someone like Ann tang who's best known as an architect\nBut the projects that we are highlighting in the exhibition is actually her first project before she began making buildings and that was a team toy and it was interesting modular toy\nUm that was essentially a kind of kid of parts and kids could make kids adults could make anything from like a push cart to a table to you know whatever it is that your imagination allowed you to do\nAnd what's important about this is that even in the period she ... she uh she said that\nIt was this project that allowed her to do something playful and that allowed her to develop her ideas so play for the for the idea of play is really important because it gets architects and designers thinking about other projects\nThat are going to Monica Lewinsky uh she's with the Milwaukee art museum curator of a new exhibit there are serious played design in mid century America or just open up running for another bunch of months months there\nAt Monica is this just kind of a novelty died and in the history of design or do things these designers you're featuring do did back in the Nineteen fifties still echo today\n[noise] yeah I think I think so I mean I think we're seeing you know ... one of the things that um people ask me about it though you know this seems like it's super popular now and there must be a reason and I think I'm actually I think in terms of its ... it has been popular for a little while\nBut I think in terms of its ideas right this idea that a free play or experimentation is really central to the work of architects and designers I mean if you look at something like Silicon Valley for example I mean they are really\nI'm a kind of driving this message home um and so I think certainly the the topic does um ... you know is is really important for corporations today so I think I think we're seeing some some of these trends continue\nFor I've talked to a lot of guts to say the one of the key uh still I guess one of the key competencies of an employee's creativity and worries that maybe we're we're focusing too much on\nYou know rigid facts math education and stuff like that and not nurturing the creativity enough is that a a worry you have as you as you look at the designs here\nI think actually that's exactly what these architects and designers we're getting at um you know just to give another example from the exhibition another architects that we feature his name is Arthur ... and he practiced in Chicago\nBut he actually also had a lot of connections to Wisconsin one of the projects that we look at is his magnet masters which was a toy that he made for a museum in Minneapolis in the Nineteen\nThing right in the bunch of shapes colors and he's employing magnets and and asking children and adults to make things out of these\nI'm Out of these shapes and magnets but actually he was thinking about magnetism at as not just something that was a a playful game but he was thinking about magnets for\nFuture buildings and he was trying to kind of ... he was actually envisioning a future in which buildings could be held together by a powerful magnetic core and it's only when you allow yourself to stopping dream and think about these things that you know the future as is possible I mean\nAnd and we can even think about something like you know Tesla or a you know going you know uh when when we when we talk about uh you know regular civilians going to the moon right I mean this kind of thing wouldn't be possible fifty years ago if it weren't for um you know at a designers vision\nWhat are you hoping or maybe the the non professional designers who visit the uh the exhibit what are you hoping they're inspired to do when they leave\n'em well I Hope that they come through the a bunch of really beautiful things that\nInspired them you know in their own lives I Hope that they take some time to actually explore the play areas and again let their minds go free and and maybe you know spin a top he maybe haven't spent a top since you were seven but uh you know just to kind of enjoy the\nProcess of doing that and and I hope that actually gives you some pause and it causes you to think that oh maybe I should blackout Fifteen minutes a day to not read something or not look at email or not look at my screen and actually just let my mind go I think that would be the greatest thing\nAre there are a couple artifacts in the exhibit that you'd want us to maybe pause by for a few extra minutes and really uh really taken and be inspired by\nOh my gosh there are things\nI don't want to tell you how many objects on the show because I don't want to scare you but um\nThat you know I honestly I Believe that the the show in which there is a little bit of something for everyone and as I've gone through and I've watched people\nYou know pause at for example there's a beautiful installation of of mid century clocks um there are ten clocks that were\nUh most of them designed by Irving Harper for George Nelson one of them ... for for George Nelson a produced by the Howard Miller clock company and these are just super fun super ... and the way that they're installed um you know cause people to kind of stop take a photograph\nYeah maybe maybe say like oh I remember seeing this in grandma's house um I think that there are a lot of really beautiful moments like that throughout the exhibition\nAnd do you think maybe some you'll see these and we'll see a new a clock or abuse the furniture or what have you ah intensive juniors inspired by what they saw their\nUm fingers crossed I mean I Would love for there to be some young designers I'm In you know in Milwaukee that are going through and and that that they're inspired by something that they see that would be really wonderful\nMonica thanks for joining us it's been a lot of fun thanks so much Rob\nMonica Lewinsky as the dumber curator of twenty twenty first century design at the Milwaukee art museums curated oversee this new exhibit we've been talking about serious played design in mid century America organized with the Denver art museum exhibits open now through January six\nBy the way there is a gallery talk with Monica tomorrow it one thirty PM at the museum check Mam dot org for more days coming up learn about the\nThere aren't any jobs around a half of the African American men in Milwaukee and some sort of a criminal record that makes it much harder to get a job any kind of job the good jobs are inappropriate need to get out there\nYou have children you need childcare to to someone to take care of your kids so this makes it and not to mention of violence and the trauma that surface makes it very difficult to lead a normal life and normal economic life than most people would like to move\nIf they could afford to\nSo my student Mitt Desmond wrote a famous book called evicted and Matt said you know in central city of Milwaukee people are paying forty and fifty percent of their incomes for rent\nBut of those kinds of some policy farmed just as a lovely report it's not because rents are higher comes available if because incomes are so down all\nSo I'll give you one number is is a great guess number [noise]\nSuppose I ask you the phone was in Milwaukee County what fraction of black families with children were living with incomes above twice the poverty line meeting about forty or fifty thousand dollars\nThe answer is one in eight only so if you pick a black it out as a seven eighths chance of due to poor and therefore they're not doing well in school they're stuck in the central city schools they don't have alternatives the families can't move out\nTo avoid the violence and to improve the schools and things for their kids so that that's a problem if we're going to solve poverty in the state of Wisconsin we have to pay attention to Milwaukee\nTalking attempts meeting for me to be Madison looking at a new report on poverty rates in Milwaukee County in particular ten I'm hearing a whole bunch I kind of chicken or egg type questions there aren't jobs\nBut a job creators are gonna want to move in this area if they don't feel like it's safe if there's not a opportunity to sell things to people ah that's just one of the where do you start\nQuestion you need to get people to the jobs and their jobs are on the periphery or even the jobs are in the infrastructure building up for Fox Canada everything those jobs Jeanette require high levels of education [noise] those are the sorts of ...\nDid someone for a job in employer could take someone or formerly incarcerated approached and give them a chance working in construction crew\nAnd in fact uh I don't see why that doesn't happen but uh\nYou know this has been terrible 'cause of the blame game has been going on in Milwaukee for a long long time of the Democrats are better than the Republican some errors been sitting on this for for as long as he's been there and before that\nAnd somebody needs to get off the dime and make some changes there has to be some policy employers if they're hungry for people and they want to give people a second chance the way they are doing here in Madison\nYou need to go off for jobs to people give them a chance to they could subsidize them give them a shoe dollars off an hour for training purposes and gives them a bonus if they're still working and six months or something that would be one nice way of injecting some money into\nInto downtown of course you'd have to get them out to the jobs\nBut employer over there's there's ways of getting people to the jobs if if employers are hungry as some people think there\nIs there a need for subsidies for transportation like that as you say to get from St central Fisher doesn't forever\nAnd look in this town and you see all those represents driving around those are all those state fans I when I was running the poverty Institute at six people hear from you weren't in Janesville and boy to get an event and we have to go back why can't there'll be a van somewhere in downtown Milwaukee the picks guys up to six thirty seven in the morning\nTakes them out to the job and brings them back after that so low cost if that's what an employer wants and if they need that labor\nAnd I mean this is all mixed up in a race to and racial politics we know you can find white formerly incarcerated men on the front page of the New York times walking out of prison into a job in stone trailer\nBut I Can't get any data from the state on how well we're doing with African American it on that same in getting keeping them from going back to prison and getting them jobs\nIs is not a priority because this is primarily black area we're talking\nAbout it could be I mean a lot of people haven't reaction a black man that they're scary they've been in prison which a lot of them have some\nWho for violence shouldn't be it should be in prison they shouldn't be put young first time offenders if we can divert them something other than prison\nIf he could start to get them involved in jobs if you could give them an opportunity and the same thing now next fall the single parents are going to say if you are so low income you're still receiving our future program you have to work three hours a week\nWell where's the childcare where's the transportation who's going to give them a chance is there a transition job you can go to so I'm One of our former students Johnny Hunter here who runs the for the local food closet as underground watcher\nHe and his colleagues set up a bakery sunshine bakery which gives people a chance to learn how to be bakers in in places them in jobs in the restaurant industry and the bakery industry in this town we need more and more things like that I mean we we really need to try and the same I receive for mothers with kids who\nWho also need to help directly themselves\nBy the way you a measure poverty is a little different than the way the feds do you include the impact on public assistance programs in that and you just mentioned the possibility of a work requirements for public assistance are there ways we could do public assistance to\nBetter ah that'll create better incentives in say that's at thirty to forty percent a poverty rate sure\n... first of all we can have a higher minimum wage that's Fifteen dollars but not seven and a quarter we could go to nine or ten dollars which is what we've done that gives you an incentive to go to work 'cause she'll get more\nBut we haven't Saturday at minimum wage if I don't want to start a business in central Milwaukee paying minimum wage why do I want to start with paying\nI Want to get the people out to the business is OK I'm not\nI mean there are ways of trying to stimulate business is business in Milwaukee but business in those areas Milwaukee's expensive I've been to those areas they have to rent they have rather guards at the front in the back door and people are afraid to go there at night and things like that [noise]\nUm so if we can't fix that area directly the trick is to give people enough economic wherever fall as they can move out of there so expanded low income housing would help too but uh that's expensive more generally\nAll right but how about a once people start getting money is there a way we can make the community something that they don't want to move out of once they can afford\nTo that would be wonderful that takes leadership within the community it picks policing the streets would take reducing continue to\nReduce crime um it's just very difficult they're reducing unplanned pregnancies would be good so that I'm young women and men who did not want to have a baby didn't have an accent and they have a baby\nWhich if you don't have your education or a job or that creates you know really steep row to hoe fruits you know if you don't if you haven't finished your education of a job you don't have a partner and you don't have a plan [noise]\nIt's hard to raise that kid in the non poverty situation and then it hurts the employment situation of a mother and father and the father may end up in jail\nTo its you know\nOne of the things that we do know that work so it's a lot of people who are scared are afraid to move out\nTo move out of the city into a different area and if we could do more of that that would help and one way to do it as if people go to earn some money and get their earned income tax credit when they get at once a month if you go first to last month's rent that allow you to move okay if we had a child allowance at our country like other\nIf we took three child tax credit of two thousand dollars a year which I get and most other parents do\nAnd made it pay monthly and made a refundable that'd be a hundred and Seventy bucks a month check that per kid that every mother would get and they could use that to to help enhance education their children maybe find a private school a Catholic school some other school but\nAlso them to you know not worry about whether you have to choose between the ... the rent so forth every month\nTalking attendance meeting professor of public affairs and economics at the La Follette school of public affairs a U.
