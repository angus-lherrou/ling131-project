mural when you're in the two of them coming up next\nFirst coverage for preexisting conditions has become a big part of this year's midterm elections with candidates up and down the ticket from both parties saying they want to protect her in the race for governor Democrat Tony ... has been criticizing Governor Scott\nWalker for a lawsuit here that's trying to strike down the Affordable CARE Act is unconstitutional walkers solution requiring preexisting condition coverage of the state level hit a snack yesterday when leaders of the state legislature said they weren't sure if you have the votes to support that\nDonald Read some of the thing was researcher and health policy program director at the University of Wisconsin population health Institute she also oversees the group covering Wisconsin which helps ... residents with insurance plans Donna welcome back to central time\nTo be with you well it's a moving target in some ways book right now as of today what's this coverage for pre existing condition to look like right now in Wisconsin [noise]\nWell it looks the same as it looks at the national level because uh the protections are extended under the Affordable CARE Act or the same nationally I'm for it with and all the states so um insurance plans are not able to exclude people based on preexisting conditions\nAnd um people cannot be I'm faced differential pricing based on preexisting conditions\nSo we've got this national lawsuit Wisconsin as part of it are saying we Affordable Care act is unconstitutional a hypothetical you for court were to strike down the whole thing what then happens to this uh the preexisting condition coverage mandates\nWell it would be a substantial change without a doubt if the if the Affordable CARE Act goes away the pre existing conditions peace would would go away along with it and that would affect a lot of people on it would affect really virtually everybody in the state in some way\nThe estimates are that about twenty five percent of the adult population in the state or about eight hundred and fifty thousand or adults in our state have some kind of excluded preexisting condition\nAnd people think of large conditions like cancer but this can act included really common conditions as\nMy depression diabetes those kinds of things and a lot of people either half\nOf them are at high or at high risk for developing these kinds of conditions so if the um existing law goes away and we don't have anything in its place than insurance plans will have\nThe ability to exclude um those people with those conditions from coverage or substantially increase the price for plans for people who have those conditions\n\nDid you know that this was happening at the time he said you were five ... five I have no memory of it so now the stories that you get are ones that you have him retail you writer on you know just his recollections and so now your dad and you have a daughter and you've been taking her to some of the game when has that been like that's\nThe dream come true for me more more than being able to attend to myself to be able to share it with my daughter because my dad never had the chance I mean you were super into the team but the team was just never in the playoffs when I was a kid so yeah to see her light up and celebrate a victory and\nJust like fuel the crazy energy in place\nSo you went to a game this weekend and I was lucky enough men stupidly bought tickets for a game that's weekend well you got to see them when\nI see them when not driven in your face a little kid it was an amazing experience and the energy and electricity in that stadium was so overwhelming especially at\nThe end obviously when they won but it's like it didn't die down the entire game\nIt's really cool when I'm when I went to the divisional series and saw him when I finished during those two electric the whole time stadium floated when they won everybody's like singing and cheering and\nWho are [noise]\nIt's such a British cubs fan variants that uh you know and even with cubs fans you know they had a huge drop between World Series but it's not like they weren't making the playoffs right

outlook on life had orange and I have I'm Maureen\nLast a brewer is now Packers fans are known to be devoted even repeatedly ranking number one in the Forbes List of NFL best fans and what makes a fan happier than getting to feel a part of the team joining us now or to Green Bay Packer fans whose work beginning with painting murals on fences surrounding the stadium has made them even more a part of the pack\nSpencer young is a graphic designer an artist from shocked in vain stats is a graphic designer and painter from Green Bay together they've been painting murals on fences surrounding limbo field for years now they've been dubbed the unofficial Packers artists are the Green Bay press Gazette Spencer welcome to central time\nHey Rob thanks for having me and again thanks for joining us\nYeah thanks for having us\nWell let's hear the story you're both fans obviously you're both artists Spencer how did you end up paying these murals on Lombardi avenue\nA it's a quite a funny story I I'm actually left my job but it was in office desk job and just it wasn't for me you know it's it's fun working on the computer but my real passion was painting and I pursued this dream and\nFortunately a month went by and busy and call me and said I there's an opportunity to paint the Packers fence and\nI thought he was lying to me because I remember growing up and that was the one thing I remember it was a press handler the previous Packer fans painter doing that every year and I just told myself man that'd be so cool to do and here we are I mean I'm living my dream right now\nAnd again this is a lot of pressure this is something that basically every single Packer fan is going to come in the on game day much less the rest of the week did you feel a lot of weight on your shoulders when you did that first\nMural or the first one level that just because they only had three weeks notice\nToo that I'm so to come with the design and then executed but under twenty four hours\nI'm repeated one day but I could do that we had to do it with a little a nerve wracking but I mean the first year we feel like they knocked out of the art and then every year after that I just got a little better\nAnd let's say let's get the dimensions of the fence or Spencer because I think people like ... there's a little thing along aside I mean\nIt's a large fence if I remember correctly it's about sixty six feet long and six feet high\nSo that's how they do you plan out something like that so it's you know well proportionate that line\nYeah we both kind of have our own little methods to use a sensor used like a grad student at our printed a large format sided and all that my proportions are accurate about 'em as if each year we kind of perfect our our work ethic and I'm\nThe best thing they can to to make sure we can paint the one day and ... if yeah go ahead\nWhy does happy one day\nAnd that was the the request of the fence on the first year and we kind of thought I was challenged and we just want to keep doing that thing Alex every year because that Saturday the for the first game is just one huge party down there just about every kind of ... ... ... it's kind of a ... just have one big one time\nAnd Spencer there's a different theme each year what was your theme\nSeason I think the big give away was the Hundred Years' here celebrating you gotta go big so ah just planting between ... and myself and actually the owner of the fence we decided that it would be cool to see not only step it up but stepping up big\nIn previous years we painted about two players on the fence or this year we painted heat\n[laughter] so that was the challenge I I didn't think it would be done but the only thing that sets us up now we gotta do this previous years fans and come up with some better next year so I'm kind of worrying about it but I I'm sure we'll be able to get something done\nAt Packers fence Xena what kind of response or online or in person do you get from the fans\nSponsors unique which is kind of fun to see but as far as a Christian and I'm just fan can robbery see I'm I'm just hoping that you can also it's kind of see them interact and\nAnd really appreciate what kind of what we do I mean that's what I donate our time to do this for them what we see other fan reaction that it's ... it's kind of makes us feel good about um the organization that Pakistan as well\nAs I understand you've done other or both of you I think I've done some other Packers themed are taught what kind of what kind of stuff have you done\nA it ranges a it's it's totally random actually with projects that I've done a actually this season I'll be painting for sure to Packer players cleats for weeks Thirteen so my cause my cleats\nUm I've done work for other Packer players and then just Packer fans in general so it's it's always a keeping me busy\nAnd then do you get responses from the team in the organization itself\nYeah we have I mean are we a mark perfectly stopped off the phone and talk to us for a few seconds kind of failure appreciate or going hum so that's pretty huge to see that here that the average president um but yeah I mean players reach out and it just wasn't a good response kind of everyone\nSpencer as this is like an artist dream of canvassers you're you're doing something that a lot of people are gonna see is gonna be hard to top is you're young you've got along artistic career out of you\nYeah uh each year I right before I we paint the fence I I just say to myself like how how are we going to do this how are you going to do this and a each year we just managed to you know make something out that you know in each year that's our plan and that's our intention is to make something that\nThe Packer fan community will love and appreciate and hopefully more people become Packer fans cause of it\nAnd seeing what is it like for you as an artist being able to combine your two loves the art and uh your Packer fan dub\nIt's great I mean it's a dream come true it's kind of whatever or hope to do um especially at the scale exposure and are doing it so I but we really love it um we all ... all day and I are each year and kind of scale for the sake of so I mean it's great\nSpencer you're you mentioned that you're already thinking about next year I'm sure you have don't have a lock down and you wouldn't want to tip your your hands too early even if you did a lot that said what are you looking at for inspiration is there a moment I think there was a hail Rogers' theme a couple of years ago I'm assuming that was\nInspired by one of his Hail Mary pass is\nA correct that I'm ... was inspired by the previous game with the motor city miracle so it had to pay homage to that and then\nCoincidentally that that was the first home game opener was against the lion so it's kind of a slow burn on lions fans there and have to relive that moment when they come to limbo\nAnd Xena or leave us with uh some thoughts on on your Packer themed art to leave leave a message for your your fans who are watching your murals each year\nAnd it's like I'm appreciative of the ... the fences um goes a long way and we just keep the help bring new designs are down ... avenue and keep elevating the fat experience\nAll right ... thanks good luck to you and to the team of course this season\nThank you\nAnd Spencer thanks for joining us in our studio in Green Bay thanks Rob really appreciate your time we've been talking to Spencer young graphic designer an artist from Stockton and dizzying stats graphic designer and painter from Green Bay\nWhat the person is genuinely put into the writing more than I could from from an email and I will always be\nI Will always be doing that it

that kind of has all these intimate letters of of people throughout history and\nI just don't think that email that no it has the same rate on you know because it's so exciting that the what somebody's handwriting looked like and what kind of paper they were using um and to see those ... in there I mean not that makes it real and when it's just on a computer\nThat just doesn't seem as um as much of an intimate glimpse into their lives\nAnd thanks for calling in June and you also mentioned Susan ... anticipation like you're going to the mail and there could be something cool in there and I got to say I when I hear the male falling we've got a male fall when I hear the male fall in there is a part of me to think\nWell maybe there's something cooler and there isn't because I don't read letters I don't get letters so it's I Know it's going to be advertising circulars and you know the utility bill for something like that is that part of the fund knowing that he said the goal might be their\nExactly I mean nobody gets excited when they get an email an email just means something that you're going to have to work and that you're going to have to think about and replied to add something to get through where the piece of mail is as really exciting you can look at it\nBecause somebody's waiting on you um you can take your time like do dead and really think about what she wanted to say\nGo to another caller now sue is with us in cash bill to hello\nHi thanks for taking my call um I really enjoy writing letters cards probably right for five weeks and actually have a

the sharing that with us and Susan both shoe and Jude mentioned something did you have a wife being really fast the letter writing and reading is a way to slow down\nYeah exactly I mean think about the last time you sat down to write a card or a letter I mean you're going to be taken out a paper and a lot of people who I spoke to thought about the idea of thinking about the person while you're writing it you know picturing their face while you're writing them a letter and it's kind of a really beautiful moment to take that time\nOut of your busy day and and sit there and and really give yourself over to this person while you're writing a card or a letter\nThanks a lot for that call and Susan in your piece you wrote about some kind of famous people who are still letter writers and you mentioned a public radio favored the author David ... so what do you have to say about writing letters\nOh yeah I was so fun to talk to him I mean I'm a huge fan of his writing and so um knowing that he was really into letter is he spoke to me um and I mean obviously he was very funny so I was laughing the whole time um but yeah he loves writing letters he writes them to all of its fans he writes them to boyfriend\nAnd I thought that was really interesting he writes them to everybody that he works with on a book tour so if I had a book store if there's people who are helping him get set up he writes them a letter and he said basically said nobody else does that um and he just said it's really coffee real males classy and he\nLikes to be thought of as classy and when he received thrilled
