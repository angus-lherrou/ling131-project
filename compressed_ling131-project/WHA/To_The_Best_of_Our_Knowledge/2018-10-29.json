congressional seats to join us for interviews on central time and in the morning so\nYou'll be able to find all these interviews at Wisconsin votes dot org\nToday we talk to incumbent secretary of state Doug La Follette he's a Democrat running for reelection and is being challenged by Republican businessmen Jay's trader secretary of state law violent thanks for joining us today\nIt's great to be here and talk to all my friends on what's gone from public radio\nNow you've been the secretary of state for a few decades now uh give us a short pitch of why Wisconsin I should reelect due to the office\nOr the important reason is because I understand the offer and what's happened to be all for\nOver the years to governors have removed important due to use for the fall ... put them under the governor's control\nAnd that was a big mistake for two reasons we need to have\nA kind of ... which means duty should not be all located in one place remembered for governor but more importantly but do need that were removed\nWhich involve goodness activities corporations trademark uniform commercial code for example are located in ... offices all across the country so they will rule because it's been a problem for both gone some\nThis off of bogus calls and emails every day who are looking for those duties down those activities\nSo I think it's important for someone like me or understand they have to work with a new governor and legislators to restore those important do you just took off for the third Thursday\nThere has been a talk over the years of eliminating the office of the secretary of state it's a completely you would take a constitutional amendment to do that or what would you say to that idea\nWell people have spoken on that idea but they've been trying to do that and this earlier they finally got a referendum on the state pleasure\nAnd the people rejected that overwhelmingly the people are basically spoke on they want to or what the public officials they don't want them to be appointed by the government or someone\nCan you talk about the remaining duties of the office of secretary of state and how you are performed at those\nThe court duty to rehab which is important is called tough deal\nIt's kind of as a third thing you do see a or the international murderer ... says under the hay convention ... being a ... ... and the Netherlands or many years ago all of a country's aboard got but the other end agree you on the process for international transactions\nWant our listeners to think that we are boring our students every you W Madison and so in that regard I Would like to think that my exciting engaging history that brings the past uh life is actually very conventional for what Mike how things are doing at your W Madison I got to make a shot at for\nMy department and also probably for our satellite campuses as well\nSo the inspiration for the course I have to say came working with students for years here\nThinking you know what are ways in which I can connect history you know whether it's deep deep you know in the past or more recent history really connected to my students so they feel\nThey feel the stakes they recognize that the people who lived in the past are much like them today I mean they may have different world views and moral commitments but they were people you know shape by larger forces\nAnd so my original idea for the course was actually do a history of their generation so history of your generation and it was going to be a more contemporary history but I I after kind of playing with that idea I realized how hard it would be for students to toggle between\nSomething really autobiographical that might be an even personal in a way that might be emotionally hard for them to then widen out and look for larger social factors so I just did the next thing that seem logical to me go a generation earlier what is the pre history of their lives\nWhat were what were the social political economic circumstances\nThat shaped who their parents were and so that the idea was born\nAnd for a lot of the students you have say incoming freshmen they'd be their parents are being cut them by demographics people born maybe in the sixties or seventies and his that but yeah zone you're yeah he's\nWell I must say I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna eat danger as they age myself ate my date myself but I was born in Nineteen Seventy said there was a kind of um\nUm I don't want to say unpleasant moment when I realized oh my word that's me you know um that that we're talking about\nUm and so yeah the it I mean the demographics has never perfect um sometimes ... some parents are considerably older\nBut yes the course was conceived and for the most part it has paired out that the students who are at U. W. today their parents wouldn't be born in ... you know during the ... primarily during the sixties and perhaps in the early seventies\nAnd to be honest there's enough given the course that even if you know someone would\nWhich has conceivable you know that that were were kept the courses catching them somewhere in their\nYoung childhood their\nAdolescence there early adulthood and so you know it may not be exactly the same for every student but we are definitely providing that students some snap shot 'em or extended snapshot I should save their parent at some point and they're going to become who they became and\nAs part of the goal here for students to use this first hand I wouldn't have a history their parents and and I hope we go and talk to somebody about their parent or someone else from the previous generation\nWill in fact that's the that's the first assignment that they have um so what they're asked to do is to interview their parents they can interview one they can interview the other\nYou know in the event that their parents are no longer living or they don't have a relationship with their parents or for whatever reason can't they're asked to interview someone in their parents' generation\nAnd I provide them a survey asking everything from like\nYour first political memory what were conversations at the child you know at the at the dinner table you know when did you recognize what religion you worried that that was something distinct as opposed to what other people happened what major world event was the first one of your memory you know what were your favorite movies or fashion et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAnd then they take that information I mean that alone is a treasure trove many students are\nYou know just blown away at how forthcoming their parents are telling them things they they had no idea that their parents and then they take that first the first bit of information and they think about generations in history [noise]\nAnd then what they do is so they they use some some work some sociological and historical work on what our generations how can we see conceive of generations moving throughout history and\nThey use it to kind of interpret their own parents through that lens they put it to the side and we spent however many weeks the length the bulk of the course doing real high octane social political intellectual history of the period\nAnd then they go back at the end of the course now\nAs historians really understanding this period and they re interview there in a much more informed way and I have to say those ... I mean the first surveys or a blast you know it's just kind of a mishmash of what the students are learning the end the end um interviews that are then turned into paper\nUm papers are some of the most powerful things that I have read as a professor because those students are now informed\nThey can ask very pointed questions about their parents and again it's been ... really impressive to me how open some of these parents have been about telling their kids sometimes hard hard things that they otherwise you wouldn't want to share with them\nTucker Jennifer ... and Haagen a history professor you W Madison teacher of a course called the history of your parent's generation or you can probably your specific details but can you tell us give us a sense of the kinds of stories you've gotten back from students and their parents and how they fit into history maybe in ways that students didn't expect\nOh boy there's I I mean I Want to say\nEach in their own way um every one of these students yelled something um that\nFor me also well first of all it can be very moving you know because I had a case of I've I've taught this class many many times when I think the first or second time I taught at I'm a student who hadn't talked to his dad in ten years\nWow and didn't want to interview on initially because he he harbored a lot of upset and resentment but as the course went on and again we're not doing group therapy at all but just the history gave him some perspective and I don't even know what it was but it made him feel that he could forgive\nWhatever it is he needed to get forgive and there was a ... any interviewed his dad for the you know for that and I'm I'm a interview and then and paper ... once right\nThat his parents were up at the parents thought this was maybe an occasion to unveil that\nI'm I'll give you an example of one that sticks with me and that is and this was several years ago with teaching a course\nAnd we were we got to the early eighties and the AIDS you know there are there early AIDS epidemic in a rock Hudson and the first news about aids coming out\nPrecisely at the moment and you know when gay liberation is finally you know really making its entrance on American stage and then you have this horrible you know I'm\nI'm an epidemic\nAnd one of my students said to me you know while we were reading this material that my\nMight have actually been a nurse in Boston\nDon't know somewhere she went back and interviewed her mom her mom was at the front lines in Austin at one of the gay clinics that was you know in that it right at the nerve center of the killing fields you know where so many\nAnd so she was able to find out you know she only this vague recollection that our mom you know something about er nurse maybe something about aids but the class how crystallize boom and she went in and she was able to find out and the stories her mother had\nYou know that she otherwise she wasn't hiding them from her daughter but there was just no there was no occasion to have that conversation\nI Want to ask a kind of a a conceptual thing for all students come out of this because I I read a lot of history and I still I have trouble there was a district or there's no right there is the president and there's history and that's something different and trying to grasp the idea that\nPeople then we're living through now and people now are living through history rambling like and then well what is that something that's due to now I mean I'm just glad\nTo be honest it um you just said it that's one of the most profound things that they can get out of the course I mean there is this all sort of by not kill her vision if you will\nBetween they're just moving back and forth between here now their parents now as they are and that then as they imagined I mean one end and realizing they're part of the history because their their parents offspring you know they were raised by these people\nAnd so I Do think the class has this amount of binoculars vision or stereo sound there's a there's a there's a dimension allergy to the class that I think is very I'm very very powerful\nI mean I think one of the things that class tries to do is for them to see their parents\nIn two ways one as they became who they were\nIn part not exclusively because of the context in which they lived the politics mattered you know\nThe the um the stagflation mattered um you know religious contestation mattered I mean not in everyone's case in everyone's time but you know what you would learn about the seventies and eighties those movements those circumstances those events made their parents who they were\nBut if I'm but on the flip side that their parents were also historical subjects they were shaping that history they were acting back on that history they were the ones wearing the bell bottoms are going to the marches or listening to Bruce Springsteen and changing their major you know to ... a labor studies historian or something like that briefly\nJust in our last few moments is this for those maybe more as a history of earth people is this may be a gateway drug for those students say wow this is more interested in but I I mean we thought it was before you know\nI Love that you use that phrase drug uh because I think about things that are gateway drug to the intellectual life um and I think about things books for me that were those gateway drugs I'm ... and in the art of motorcycle maintenance for example\nWho are sending drugs like heroin and ... and ... across the county lines and state lines you know it's a federal prosecutor I was in the narcotics section I'm part of my work was working to dismantle drug trafficking conspiracies and I think you know large scale investigations that worked to dismantle conspiracies as part of what we should be doing\nA but we also need to significantly expand access to treatment so that people who fall into the trap of addiction are able to get the help that they need to get back on their feet I also think we need to ... who is finally going to be serious about holding the pharmaceutical companies accountable\nFor their role in this epidemic I and I believe we should expand Medicaid and Wisconsin if we do that\nWill be able to cover about eighty thousand additional Wisconsin nights under badger care which means that more people would have the coverage they need to pay for treatment\nAnd we'd also save the state about a hundred Ninety million dollars a year that we can put to other uses including expanding access to treatment prevention efforts addressing our prosecutor shortage and reducing health care costs\nTalking to Josh call candidates for attorney general running as a Democrat here in Wisconsin\nA big issue any attorney general around the country will face is when to joining a lawsuits especially at the federal level a lot of times it's uh all the Democrats are around the country on one side Republicans on the other one is an appropriate time for a state attorney general here in Wisconsin to weigh in on a national\nIssue I think there are two things we have to look at number one is is a federal law or policy harming Wisconsin nights and if the answer to that is yes\nThen is there a strong legal challenge that can be brought to it is a law unconstitutional or otherwise illegal or legal administrative action for example I Know the answer that is yes as well then I think the state should get involved and and this is an area where my opponent and I have clear differences in terms of\nThe types of cases that we should be getting involved in a when that neutrality was eliminated more than twenty eight jeeze what part of a a challenge to that they currently are part of a challenge to that action I Believe that our age you should have joined\nLess um when protections for students were defrauded by predatory for profit colleges\nWere rolled back a number of age he spoke out but our age he didn't get involved um he has gotten a state involved in cases and challenges that I Believe are not in the interests of Wisconsin right so one of the cases he got involved in was a challenge to rule\nThat guaranteed overtime pay for people who put in the hours and make between about twenty three and forty seven thousand dollars a year\nSo he fought against overtime pay\nFor middle class families Wisconsin I don't think that that means the test of is this policy harming Wisconsin It's I think that policy helped hardworking families in Wisconsin and as you know he's one of the leaders right now of a lawsuit that seeking to invalidate the Affordable CARE Act\nWould you try to get Wisconsin off of that lawsuit\nIf elected yes I Would um if that's who the successful\nProtections are going to be eliminated for people with preexisting conditions so health insurance companies would once again be able to deny coverage on the basis of a preexisting condition young adults would lose the guarantee that they can remain on their parents' coverage until they turn twenty six\nAnd the congressional budget office estimates that more than thirty million Americans will become uninsured of the major components the Affordable CARE Act were repealed I so that suit is clearly not in the interest of Wisconsin nights and I think we should seek to withdraw from it and as a gee that's what I Would do\nAnother part of the job is defending state laws from legal challenges are there cases where you would look at a state law passed by the legislature signed by governor and say I know the attorney general's office should not be defending this particular\nLaw generally speaking I think the ages office should defend state statutes in state agency actions the the AG as the attorney or for the state in litigation I'm the exception of that is if there is a a state statute or a state agency action that's not\nI'm reasonably legally defensible 'em and you know I can give me an example of of one of those actions recently when Governor Walker\nDeclined to call special elections in a state Senate district in a state assembly district\nI took a look at that statute and it was clear that the governor was required to call those elections I think ... there should have stepped up and said governor of this is not a defensible position a and said you know I Can't defend us but instead he he did defend the governor and a judge\nWho was appointed by Governor Walker um ruled that those elections has to be called there I think ... sided with the governor rather than what's the state law I'm required\nAs we've seen at the federal level there's at least one prominent case where the U.S attorney general has recused himself from an important investigation that he would otherwise be overseeing the Russia the Mueller probe are there issues that you would say you know because of my background with that I should step aside from this and hand it to a designated a blow me on the hierarchy\nI so I've been involved in challenges to laws that restrict access to voting I including here in Wisconsin um where I was one of the attorneys involved in a challenge to more than a dozen restrictions on voting\nNow we're an accident Scott Walker's first term as well as a law that limited early voting to one location permanent ... no matter how big the municipality was a ... cases is still on appeal\nOr and so because I was involved in that case on one side I Would recused would screen myself off from that case I and the ... the deputy age would be in charge that case I'm so cases where you were involved in one side I don't the the age you shouldn't be involved in the other side of a Mac or getting elected age you\nWere talking and Josh call right now a Democrat running for the
