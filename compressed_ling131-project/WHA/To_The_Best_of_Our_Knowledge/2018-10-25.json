[noise]\nI said except for him was the youngest son as Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson she came to Madison well it would have been right after the passing and the fugitive slave act so we should go back a little bit in time after Thomas Jefferson died he created all of his children their freedom\nAs was Sally Hemings freedom\nThey grow up slaves\nOn Mount a cello on Jefferson's plantation and then once they're fried some of them identified as African American others ... because they had lighten up skills\nThey were all fairly fair skinned and they could pass even Julia\n... wife was also multi racial and so she could also pass as white they were in the sense is an Eighteen fifty in Ohio identify\nFugitive slave act passed in Eighteen fifty accent and Julie I decided to take their three kids and moved further north away from the border and they moved to Madison, Wisconsin and here they passed this white and they identified as white they lived among white society nobody ever questioned that and that is how they continue their life\nAnd Beverly who were essence two sons both served in the civil war they served in Wisconsin regiments at that time of the civil war if you were African American and identify that way you had to be in a colored regiment both of them served in white regiment so clearly there is no question that they were white and that they identified that way\nIs on the older when he moved to Memphis and became a cotton shepherd was very successful at it but never married\nThere's some theories that he chose not to because if he had a child who was dark skin\nThat would sort of blow his cover I guess in a manner of speaking and then he could lose everything that really did marry he had sons of his own he said in Madison he ran a very successful large carriage company here and purchased the first ... and Madison actually\nSo the children of a former slave became these prosperous but Raymond in Madison, Wisconsin\nYeah they did and I have no idea why they chose Madison one would assume maybe it had something to do with the name [laughter] you know it was also obviously further north certainly safer from the fugitive slave act\nWhen I first heard that one of the children of Thomas Jefferson\nAnd Sally Hemings was buried half a mile from where I live\nI was done I mean this is a long way from ... Virginia where I grew up\nYeah I was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery tours and one of my coworkers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west there is still family members in Michigan still some in Ohio they all just kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states\nJust thinking about the history of this I mean if you have the son\nOf Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these trends of American history come together right here in the senator\nRight it's interesting how little it sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today Thomas Jefferson is so famous right and he stands for so many things I don't think you can avoid feeling the weight of that here\nUm oh Mm\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOh\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life Sally Hemings\nAnd that they had children are Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants denied and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally ... children\nEven DNA evidence ... she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history\nFollowed by a MacArthur genius award and she told steep awesome this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery\nWell Beverly Beverly as a male and his sister Harriet those are the two oldest children they left Monticello to live as white people they don't have freedom papers and you can see why they don't want them because\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black 'cause they'd been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison that asked and and that's the thing about documents that the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson this revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality\nWho's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean it\nWouldn't be ... well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape\nThrough connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it as a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take them down from the mountain as this revered I don't\nKnow there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country not just Jeffrey symbol Washington at all of them a number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage and profited from that\nWith the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you\nI think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time interest and some of it was good until it was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already gotten mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was racist and he thought black people were inferior we're not as smart as one\nAnd that would most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured as a suspicion overly but it's not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America\nHe'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society that's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life you say if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine but it's that little thing over there\nThat destroys the thing that you love and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which\nThe union will be split and that was true yeah\nThank you very much it's just fascinating history Oh thank you for having me\nBats Harvard legal historian Annette Gordon Reed talking with the fall some ...\nHer book the Hemingses of Monticello won a Pulitzer

Milwaukee Eric I think we have you in are you there I Am fantastic now you grew up in Wisconsin you've been to both the polls you've done all this adventurous stuff what led you to say hey I'm going to go back to my home state and make my way from one border to the other\nBut I think a big part of my expeditions\nAbout the fact that adventure is really everywhere and you don't have to go to these extreme places defined unique and compelling adventures\nRight yeah I probably never going to go to a poll I'll be honest with you but but for for those of us in my less adventurous frame of mind how can we charted out an adventure in our in our backyard or home state\nI mean there is a million things that you can do basically anywhere and it just takes a little bit of creativity and or extra daughter planning or or quite honestly not a lot of planning whatsoever I mean\nAh Wisconsin has a lot of state parks a lot of um you know natural areas there's a lot of opportunities to get outside and I think people just need a little bit of a reminder that hey there's some pretty unique opportunities right in your own backyard and that's again really what this trip is all about\nLet's talk about your route and logistics side traverse in Wisconsin you started on the ice age tale in a trail in St Croix in the northwest part of the state you're on foot or they're not rice lake you switch to bike and then kayak from west bend to Lake Michigan share some of the highlights of the trip [noise]\nWell you know each leg was kind of a unique journey for me growing up in Wisconsin I've been all over the state but still I managed to reverse some areas that I hadn't been but I mean hiking on the ice age trail was pretty incredible peak fall colors\nLeaves falling as I was hiking through 'em so many leaves on the ground that I couldn't even see the trail in certain areas so that was pretty amazing\nI think you know the middle of Wisconsin has some of the best road biking and rope bike touring in the entire country I mean all the paved a county highways and farm roads and uh just beautiful areas rolling through farm fields and kind of would lots and small towns\nUm pretty amazing although I did run into some a somewhat bad weather and snowstorms on the bike which you know I shouldn't complain too much about snow but I I Would say it's probably one of the more a cold times that I've I've ever had\nUm and then paddling right down the Milwaukee River into Milwaukee I'm you know it's really interesting to be on the river and be surrounded by trees and and here forty three\nHere sirens or whatever in the background but still be in this real isolated area and then I have to say paddling right through downtown Milwaukee was incredible\nAnd you were on your own for this trip nine days on your own what is it like to have that kind of a solitude without a lot of those easy everyday distractions we have around us [noise]\nYeah it's incredible I mean I think that's the other really unique thing about adventure and getting outside it gives you an opportunity to kind of disconnect from\nThe hectic pace of our of our world that we're all in that I'm In and and so being able to focus on one goal and one objective for an entire day in and kind of let my thoughts wander I think it was a really incredible thing of course there's times where I Am\nI'm like oh man this is really hard and I don't want to be out here and I wish I was home but uh you know you work through that and um and then it becomes very enjoyable\nNow how does it Wisconsin kid being a end up being a polar explore [noise] well\nI think the main requirement is growing up in Wisconsin I mean we don't have mountains we don't have oceans but we have some cold winters or at least we used to\nAnd so for me I really got interested in in doing outdoor adventure by just doing things like the Wisconsin in my backyard on cedar creek and then walk river I was involved with river edge nature center a growing up and their summer camps and had some\nAre really kind of unique adventure experiences both there as well as with my family\nAnd this is full circle your kind of raising funds and awareness right for a river as nature Centre\nI have a basic motto\nSo I like to do things that are interesting to me and and fun but I also want to try to give back in any way I can and I think as I mentioned earlier adventure has given me a lot of really great gifts in life\nI'm from my perspective and skills and knowledge that I've learned and and a big part of that was that river edge and so uh we're still actively raising money I'm trying to raise five thousand dollars to help others have the opportunity to go to river edge nature Centre summer camps\nDoes is going to both the polls in Mount Everest and more does it when you come back to Wisconsin do you look at it in a different way [noise]\nI mean the thing about those trip says that\nUm I think you're pretty much the same person that ... when a before you left but you're also\nJust changed in ways that you can't even imagine so I think for me when I come back to Wisconsin I feel a greater appreciation of where I'm from and my roots and the comedian which I grew up\nOr you just completed this trip I literally yesterday I think now you're working on a plan to head back to the south pole next month to have that right\nYeah that's correct you know a a goal with my adventures is to really push that leading edge it's um how can we do things in a in a more unique more compelling more compelling and oftentimes more challenging way and so\nI have a another expedition a solo expedition planned or the south pole or I'm hoping to speak set the speed record I'm\nOf a journey of around seven hundred miles to the south pole\nAnd you're doing watch skiing or how do you how do you set that record\nYes skiing and pulling a sled and it's in the style that we call an support in on ate it and so I'm not receiving any outside assistance I'll be point on my supplies and misled with me and I'm hoping that the journey will take between Twenty one twenty three days\nWow how do you how do you set yourself up for that mentally and physically\nI mean I stared at whites you to pay for all day long on a [laughter]\nIt's hard you know a big part of what I Do a on a trip like this is experience you know I've been doing polar expeditions now for almost Twenty years and and so a lot of my preparation is based off of that a lot of physical training is really important um which is part of ... one of the reasons\nA smaller reason why I did this Wisconsin Tom trip\nAnd then just punting preparing all my gear on my food and I'm going over all those lists and making sure that I have [noise]\nYou know all my I doubt it in my T's crossed\nAnd leave us with a bit of inspiration Eric how to take on adventure even if it isn't a twenty plus days at the softball\nI mean I my philosophy is begin with one step 'em all you need to do is just take one step to get out there and and there's a lot of adventure waiting to be had\nA good place to leave that Eric thanks a lot for joining us in our Milwaukee studio today\nThank you Erik Larson is a polar adventure expedition guided dog musher an educator he returned to his home state Wisconsin for five hundred mile journey by foot bike and kayak what she completed yesterday\nYou can learn more about his expeditions and read his blog it Erik Larson explore dot com that's Larson L. A. R. S. E. N.\nComing up how do you know it's an elected official or political candidate of telling the truth a lie or something in between we'll talk about some ways we can do our own facts checking and look at the role of the media and evaluating the things politicians say and claim\nAnd that's a more or less supporter of the president saying he lies but it's no big deal so as the public watches it as a media watches it use it as we ignore that stuff and focus on the actual executive actions of the White House so\nI think it's possible to do more than one things simultaneously we have plenty of news media out there that are fully capable of doing both of these things\nI just don't see how anybody in the electorate can have a sensible discussion about policy or about the causes that many people consider to be terribly important if they don't have a sound factual basis for doing that\nIf if you don't have a factual basis then it's all either wishful thinking or fantasy that is a driving your decisions and I think there's a segment of the population and I'm not saying it's exclusively Trump supporters there are probably other people but also operate this way\nWho want to hear statements with which they agree that reaffirmed their world view and if somebody will do that then there'll be happy to follow them if someone challenges that they will push it away because it it makes them feel uncomfortable insecure\nUm and it basically disrupts their their view of the world um you know I think one of the things I Will tell my students or if I'm not speaking to the public is that it's\nIncumbent upon all of us to challenge ourselves into seek out sources of information that are reliable but which don't necessarily agree with our preconceived notions but increasingly today it seems like people\nSeek out the things that ... from what they already think is true and go from there with the assumption that in fact it is\nNot going to June currently from University of Minnesota director the sauce Center for the study of media ethics ma talking about the role of media in\nA challenging inaccurate statements lives from political figures but President Trump and others do we seen this rise in these things called the facts checkers fact checking groups their whole job to take statements from usually politicians are run them through a try\nFalls or somewhere in between a lot of this doesn't make any difference\nI don't know if it ultimately makes any difference if you're talking about the small percentage I Hope it's a small percentage of people who really are not interested in having the way they view the world challenge but if you're talking about people who would like to get to fax\nI'm not I'm not going to say the truth because there probably isn't a the truth out there\nBut we know that there are facts there are facts that are provable and what I think many of these fact checkers are doing is is testing that sometimes I Know that some of the fact checkers like the ones with the Washington Post for example\nWill read things on a sliding scale they'll say something like mostly true mostly falls\nAnd that's reality oftentimes because sometimes it's hard to get to to the ultimate facts and of course sometimes again politicians are speaking in a rhetorical way and they're maybe not being intending to say that something is literally true or false\nBut it seems to me that there's a tremendous hunger out there for truth the problem is that so many people have been condition now to believe that no one in the news media whatever that means is actually interested in giving them unvarnished facts that want to spend\nIt and so therefore they will trust primarily the institutions that they are most comfortable with and discount ah information that comes from those that they don't\nThere's a lot of debate over how to present an inaccurate statement so I have mine or if a politician says blank ah and that's a false statement are you just transmitting befall Steve my if you say politician inaccurately says blank well are you\nMay be riding over some of the gray area you were just talking about how do you you know in a headlining a lead a state that without receiving it and and that it's all\nWell it's not always possible to get it into the headline but I Hope you can get it into the lead paragraph the first paragraph or so to say that this politician is making this claim but in fact the the truth is\nEx um I think it's important to do those things the notion that objectivity means that you present all sides in a neutral way presumes that all sides are acting in good faith and and sadly what we've been learning in the last few years is that is not always the case\nOf President Trump was in Wisconsin and most of the Wisconsin yesterday to campaign for Governor Scott Walker Senator Kennedy and we'll move near a you know Democrats so he he criticized other Democrats around the country and then he said this about the media he was talking here about Democrats on immigration and California\nI said the other night jokingly probably a Rolls Royce and one of these people who served who's going to give 'em a Rolls Royce do not to say that the governor to have a\nGood job with this\nCan be\nSo how do we know when a public figure a President Trump is is joking around and you can play for hyperbole to even take a step in and say okay we need to evaluate the truthfulness of it\nI think the reality is that although certainly there are politicians that will make jokes we also know that\nOftentimes saying I was just\nKidding I was just joking is uh the response of a bully who's being called on telling a false could\n... a statement that it's offensive um you know I I Would like to think that as a nation we do retain a sense of humor and there certainly is a place for humor in politics\nBut when you're making a factual statement that you know your audience is very likely to take as such it seems to me have a responsibility to lead to be clear cut about what you're doing and I think President Trump a you know frequently doesn't do that\nCurrently a professor of media ethics at the University of Minnesota\nYou can join the discussion that eight hundred six four to one two three four how do you evaluate the truthfulness of political claims what do you think the role
