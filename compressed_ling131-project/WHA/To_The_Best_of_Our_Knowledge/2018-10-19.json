and this was about eight years ago [noise]\nA lot of students at that point of my students were getting iPhones and they're all talking about oh I Love my iPhone right and they kept using this for love\nThat we were starting to forge these emotional connection with our technology\nActually when you think about it just seems kind of normal\nI mean there are days when I look at my phone more than I look at my family it's kind of like my silicon best friend is not widely call it personal technology [noise] well this hour just how deep does attachments go\nWe'll talk with filmmaker Astrid Taylor and media theorist digress cough\nThat first Alexander wines team author of children of the new world a debut collection of short stories about the dangers of are increasing reliance on digital technologies that garden sat down with him to find out more\nThings have gotten more and more strange what Snapchat and tender and grinder and all the different request we have to join this or that social network yeah so let's talk about the very poignant and very powerful story saying goodbye to yank can you tell me a bit about the story\nYet so here we have a world that's pretty close to our own and the only real differences are that people are buying robotic\nBig brothers and sisters as babysitters for their children\nAnd these can be of any nationality and sort of any any background you want and and there's a little bit of tension between them and the cloning folk right there are people that are cloning themselves in cloning children\nSo there's a little bit of a kind of whole foods organic movement going on with the non ... that they sort of non GMO but\nThey are erroneous Lee I think leaning ON Technology as the place where they're going to find a way to just stay human\nAnd so they have this big brother who takes care of their adopted child\nAnd his name is yang and at the opening of the story he breaks down he malfunctions and so the drama the story deals with trying to see if they can't read booed him or get him fixed and realizing how much they started to see him this family has seen him as actually their son or as a child in their house [noise]\nWhen we adopted Mika three years ago it seemed like the progressive thing to do [noise]\nWe considered at our one small strike against cloning tire and I are both white middle class and I lived and easy and privileged life [noise] it was Cairo who suggested she be Chinese here's quake had left thousands of orphans and its wake me come on them it was hard not to agree [noise]\nMy main concern where the cultural differences [noise] the most\nI knew about China came from the photos and learn Chinese translations on the place mats that golden dragon the adoption agencies suggested purchasing yang [noise]\nHe's a big brother babysitter and store how some cultural knowledge all in one of the woman explains [noise]\nOh it's an interesting ... yeah I mean that's the lure right of the Internet in some ways that's the sweet part I guess you could say of what the Internet allows us write the beneficial sides is that we we long for connection yeah we long not to be lonely we long to know that we're not\nCrazy or that there are other people like us out there or that we're loved and nice kind of very human emotions and\nThe Internet promises promised promises still promises that we will\nWe will connect with other people and and it does obviously it that's why people fall in love on line and they meet long lost friends and they come together and\nI often think of somebody who is gay or buy in a small town and they don't know that anybody around them they're surrounded by people that are telling them they're wrong and they can reach out to big cities and find out that\nThey're not wrong right in that they have a community out there\nThese are examples of really great connection the difficulty becomes that there's a way that we're also toward it on line and so\nI mentioned online dating for example where somebody can fall in love but on the flip side it also teaches you to like white people into the trash that you don't like and so there's this great loneliness or this great kind of cold hearted in is that it can create wherein I think we start to see people as commodities\nThere's also there's hope to become a YouTube sensation and so\nThere's a survival of the fittest capitalism that has snuck in to all our online interaction so that if I write you know something about I don't know Paris and an email\nSuddenly I'll see my banner trips to Paris and that becomes very sketchy and very more this feeling of constantly being used and I think I got started materialist philosophy\nEnds up intruding into our online interactions that can cause much more

reasons musical but also\nDakota and he was from Minneapolis there was a weird connections sort of I guess being in Wisconsin and same thing but also it's like a certain kind of like northern Midwest like [noise]\nFeel like our mid West is very different than what most of America things in the mid west in Iowa\nIn Kansas and stuff and this feels different you know more I sleep so I was like boy this is like a real real bomb or whatever so I turn off my phone and I watch the movie and I watch the whole thing kind of vaguely thinking about prince not directly I mean I've followed the plot but it was always sort of there and\nThen we'll go to the movie and I turned my phone back on it and I started looking at social media suddenly it feels like I didn't care about\nPrince at all like like these people are acting as though that their whole life is shutting down like I was able to\nGo to a movie you know I got ... doesn't it was like this is weird like am I in on dealing

be good and still be weird [noise]\n\nCommentary from ... close to him on his latest book is called ten [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThere's a reason that we just can't get enough of the Internet in a new book the people's platform filmmaker after trying to argue that our digital life is on the Democratic\nBecause we handed our political and economic power over the giant tech corporations who are making money off every post and tweet we make I think\nNeed to talk about the way that these devices and these platforms in these websites are actually addictive by design every aspect of a website like Facebook has\nTested to see what gets us to engage the most so everything from the color schemes to wear buttons or place and they need to maximize our engagement to maximize their cliques because they get data from that and that's actually the business model of these\nSites they're advertising finance and so they need us to engage in to give more information into like as many things as possible because that's where the profit comes from so I think it's important to shift that to go this is not just about\nI was just real for three decades MIT\nProfessor Sherry Turkle has been studying the ways we interact with machines through her books to second self and life on the screen and in her most recent book Alone Together she explores the toll digital technology is taking on our personal relationships\nWe are living a life smacks of watching the physical and watching the virtual and I think that's genuinely new and that can only come if you have a device with you that lets you [noise] you know literally the dinner with your friends\nLooking up and looking down in a moment at your blackberry and doing something in your virtual world doing something on Facebook that your life as a mixture of what you do and the real and virtual\n\nI was at a funeral people at the funeral party or are hiding their blackberries under the funeral programs they're texting\nIt didn't just happen once and it happened several times and many people have spoken to me about similar experiences they had had\nIt's about not taking a moment\nTimes that we need to be most present to each other\nIt's not just about letting our attention wanders\nIt's about forgetting the point of the exercise which is to be with each other at the times in the town\n\nTo take time it's less dark speaking to someone who is talking about a Fifteen year old birthday party\nThere's pointed this party when everybody wants to go home and part of being Fifteen and\nSuccessfully getting to be sixteen and it's that Fifteen year olds have to fight through that moment and learn to get along with each other and can make it work with each other\nBut it's just Fifteen year old birthday party everybody could just you know get on their Facebook and\nAnd not have to deal with each other\nAnd this option can not just ignore each other\nBut to really find\nActive social place in the world to include each other I think that is genuinely new [noise]\nWe really need to think about when we need to deliberate when we need to\nJust be with each other I think the question is not turning off our technology and not getting underway wonderful technology but it needs to be putting its place and sometimes you really just need to be with each other and give each other are full attention\nThe sense

mention Twitter Instagram Snapchat and all the rest\nWill media theorist Doug Rushkoff says all this technology is actually changing our relationship to time and we're all having trouble adapting to us\nHe talked with Steve ... dug the\nTitle of your book present shock is a reference to Alvin saucers Nineteen Seventy book future shock what's the difference between future shock and present shock\nI guess in some sense maybe the the sensation might be similar to the real difference is that the future that out and talk to her was describing that we were moving towards is here with us now so well Tom Sawyer was really warning us\nReally to learn how to orient to a world\nThat was changing ever more rapidly to basically be able to adjust to change itself I'm arguing that that changes happen that if anything you know as we pass from the nineties into the twenty first century\nWe became less of a society that was just obsessed with the future and what's next and what's happening what's the next big thing where is it all going\nAnd we became a society that was very much\nIn the moment in a kind of a a an always on real time hyper connected moment so our our focus really becomes less about how do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living in a world where\nSame time ... were you break this idea of present to them down into five big areas and little let's talk about that was one you call ... ... what is this\nWhich is interesting and it kinda comes out of that video game sensibility I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou're the one going to the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice to choice rather than watching these canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment\nVery often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line where we're choosing both that we've ended up with really multiple instances multiple incarnations of ourself\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copy so well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox it's filling up with messages that are waiting for responses their view on Facebook who\nMight be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in these sponsored stories\nNow so how do you deal with all of these different use running simultaneously that's sort of the essence\nThis digital ... or this kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're a single person now he's going to have to deal with all of them I got the idea for the digital any a chapter when I was\nIn the lobby of a hotel in Berlin and I kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk with her I'd be able to get from one to the other in time\nAnd each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got wife I and I'm In this lobby\nAnd I get this message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar because they said I was trying to log in from too many places at once [laughter] right so Google Calendar didn't believe I was a human being\nThey didn't believe one human could be an all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not this idea of information overload and all these people have all these problems with digital technology and this I promise you present shock is not one of these books is just\nWhining and handwringing about the problems of Tallahassee but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital timeframe and digital technologies really don't understand time they live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you\nJust because people are sending emails out to you it doesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them right the beauty of digital technology was that it waited\nYou know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were also smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we founded smarter on line than we did in real life\nRight well and and the irony of course is that this was supposed to make our life better it was supposed to make it easier and it seems like it's just made me feel crazier\nAnd that's because I mean and not to get leftist on you or anything but I I really do believe it's because instead of using digital technology kinda for slack which is what we saw\nMan our underwear anytime we want you know 'cause we'll just get our work done and and turned it in as
