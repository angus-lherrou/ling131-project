interested in seeing personalities that they do\nAnd that they loved and seeing really in depth non fiction or something\nFor those movies even without that big personality are the streaming services services helping them find their audience and vice versa the audience a you know that might not have been able to go to a big city to see it on the two screens and was on now they can find that more specialized documentary\nAbsolutely Netflix or Amazon Hulu and\nEnormous in terms of getting a wide variety of documentaries out to an amazingly large audience I as you said\nPeople who don't live in New York and not way I don't have nearly the options even in theaters for documentaries as are others and so you wind up with a situation where Netflix a documentary just show up on your TV or you know given friday\nThat really has allowed the streaming services to cater to a wide audience by doing a number of different types of things including as we've seen especially with Netflix true crime which has has has just been an enormous\nA draw for them and as I think really sort of help re ignite interest in documentaries in general over the last two or three years\nFrom talking to next sugar film critic and culture writer or he was telling us about the rise the rebirth in some ways of documentaries in the age of streaming services Nikki wrote a piece for Esquire the best documentaries of twenty Eighteen so far out what a tell us a couple that are at the top of your list\nHere at the top of my list is a film actually that sort of a documentary hype parade or called twenty four crane it's by a world famous rainy and director named\nA couple of years ago and this was his final film it is a series of actually twenty four still photos that he sort of brings to life in animated form it's a really beautiful sort of challenging meditation on mortality and on the Senate my self uh\nMy other one and number two on my list is film worker which is a totally different type of film it is a portrait of\nA man named Leon Vitale who for decades boy Stanley Kubrick right hand man and so the film is both this fascinating study of sort of be genius behind the genius and also a study and obsession and what that can\nDo to you when you dedicate your entire life to somebody else to Beijing are both of those were a little out of the ordinary or so is my number three films is be Seventeen which is a fascinating got married about\nA tragedy that took place in Arizona in Nineteen Seventeen that involves a lot of issues are having to do with immigration and intolerance that are making they're making a very relevant story today are those coupled with\nAs we've said the big hits or\nHow you won't you be my neighbor a and R B cheap also a film called minding the gap which was out on Hulu recently all of those films are really great it really has made it a banner year for a documentary\nAnd of those and others on your list really highly the diversity of documentaries 'cause I think when people hear a documentary or al ... when I hear documentary I think oh it's something that's going to focusing on one issue or one period of history or maybe it's a biography\nAnd it sounds like you're saying there's a lot of rain here in terms of a form a experimentation on some of these ... and ... there's a lot more going on out there [noise]\nThere is there is there's really a wide variety is it the films we've been talking about that or the big hits are won't you be my neighbor RPG and another documentary called three identical strangers all which have a really great mainstream appeal because they have great personalities at their center where they have great fascinating in real life stories\nThat they're you know are sort of almost like page turners in a certain size three identical strangers plays almost like a thriller in certain regards and a mystery at the ... there were a lot of other films out there to challenge the foreman do sort of unique things with them\nAnd I don't think you know documentary filmmakers ... documentary fans have to necessarily settled for them\nThese films a lot of them wind up on your streaming services I felt like minding the gap which is on Hulu with the hula documentary original it's about three young kids who grew up in Rockford, Illinois state borders and their story is fascinating story that eventually winds up being a story not only about economic disadvantages\nBut about sort of a domestic abuse and so there's there's a really wide variety and I\nThe great thing about documentaries is\nIt gives you this amazingly diverse view of life itself and so you know a fifth year in particular has has proven that to be the case\nTo give a listen to the trailer or from the one you were just talking about minding the gap or some uh three teenage boys from Illinois find their sense of self and family and skateboarding take on\nAmerican family\nA\nNurse so like I didn't fit in with my parents ran this very controlling how\nOf wearing family then [noise]\n\nHow does it mean well they call it child abuse now\nThat\nWe have to really grow up\n[noise] and then somewhere\nIt's one of the things that documentaries can do that maybe take these characters who might be stock characters in everyday life oh there's some kids skateboarding and look at the world through their point of view [noise]\nYeah there's a real nuance to documentary filmmaking when it's done it it's fine that's uh that that really is sort of almost unparalleled of when you have real access to these unique individuals even though they seem like kids you've seen a million times before in a million movies are seen in your community or ... in the streets or\nYou know a film like mining the gap really lets you in to not only see their whole lives and their personal relationships gets a sense of their interior lives\nAnd you know when you're on the Internet it's fine is a film like mining the gas is really yellow illuminated a for not just a specific person or people but about the human condition in general\nWe're talking to a film critic next sugar about the rising popularity of documentaries and we want to hear from you have you always
