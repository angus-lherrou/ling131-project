April which caused evacuations across superior and prompted dozens of people who seek medical treatment\nDaniel ... as a reporter for WPRI news based in superior she's been following this story Danny welcome back to the show\nYeah thank you so much from\nBefore we get into the specific violations is ocean is saying or implying hey if you had done things right at this refinery we wouldn't have had this fire and explosion\nMay most certainly are they said that if a company happen ensuring the mechanical integrity of equipment used during the refineries shutdown\nThat that could have prevented this incident um they found that the refinery failed to test and inspect equipment um that was going to be used during the shutdown\nUm they did not trained properly train or a train workers or contractors\nAs part of work that was to be completed on the shutdown aided not insure that contractors or trade workers were using the appropriate hearts or materials that were needed to use as part of that shut down\nUm and that's just some of the things that they were cited for a by the occupational safety health and Safety Administration\nSo eighty thousand plus dollar fine uh I don't know from contact if that is a particularly large fire and given the size of the company given the violations at hand is there a sense that this is a really punitive or is this a slap on the wrist\nYou know I was thinking about that yesterday and perhaps I'm not comparing apples to apples here but um we have covered finds that had been assessed by OSHA against treasure shipyards here and superior um it's a ship building company\nAnd a recently and you know as soon as two years ago they had been assessed ah more than a million dollars in fines for blood lead poisoning of a couple of hundred workers there um they eventually settled that down to about three quarters of a million dollars\nBut uh I think there are people and that there definitely are people who have said that this fine as a slap on the wrist and you know if you're going to have\nUm if you're going to neglect or not be taking care of that's appropriate to prevent this kind of incident and what kind of find is

[noise]\n\nNew research led by W Madison has revealed some fascinating information about one of the world's tiny but mighty little creatures and a lot of ants are farmers or two hundred and fifty species of um in fact in in evolutionary terms ants were very early adopters of farming\nAccording to this new research they figured out how to make the right partnerships to keep their crops driving camera encourage the Ira al ...\nSort of a lead researchers on this project spending how ants created a relationship with bacteria to become successful fungus farmers cameras thanks a lot for joining us today thank you Ron will give us the timeframe first of all of the particular answer looking at here\nSo the so the answer we study or a a tribe of ants that include as you said about two hundred and fifty species that um they estimate is that they evolved to do this fungus gardening and fungus growing up but I'm fifty to sixty five million years ago\nAnd people may be hearing about that not really thinking of ants as farmers but they they do a fair amount of of different kinds of ants agriculture\nYeah they in fact you ... you know our current available evidence suggests that they probably were the first farmers or some other groups of insects will grow their own food but um these ants um or one of the best examples of of in nature of of farming\nAnd at this new research involves amber right ads cotton amber amber is this amazing thing it seems like every few weeks we're fighting cool information from the past trapped in amber what are we looking at in this amber\nSo so in terms of the study from from the amber perspective we got we got material for a ... there was a kept her from Dominican amber I'm these ants um were embedded in the amber we estimated Fifteen to twenty million years ago\nAnd what it's really incredible but this is that we could see the microbial Samantha we work on embedded within the amber so what this means is that the ants were associating with his microbe or Fifteen to twenty million years ago\nAnd talk about this relationship now the answer going some kind of fungus first of all yes so what I talk about the fungus sent and an agriculture as relates\nTo them so so that the ads you know it's very it's actually incredibly um fascinating complex association the so the ants grow\nFungus for food like we grow plants for our food they cultivate mushrooms gr social August of around ... we do we do um uh in like human farmers the ants have problems with the agricultural diseases so so passive their fungus garden and this\nIs a pathogen is a another fungus\nThat attacks in consumes the fungus answer culturing and and if this fungus\nGrows or it can grow very rapidly in in completely devastated fungus gardens ... of the ants\nSo the ... the the organism we were focused on is actually a fourth player in the system so it's actually bacteria the ants use that produces antibiotics that helps protect the fungus from the pathogenic fungus\nAnd part of the interesting story is if I if I have this right the ants if their body said devolved to have a little nooks and crannies for this helpful bacteria that that help stop this blight\nYeah so so so the major aspect of the study is kind of studying these structures and these structures in some ants can be incredibly elaborate in in in one way of thinking about it is that the ants um can be completing the outlined with Crips or or cavity so these are kind of\nEmbedded within the exoskeleton the ants and inside the cavity is where the bacteria grows and so some of these structures changing and ... of change incredible ways over the fifty\nSixty five million years of this association\nSo you've got a ... like I guess the timescale over millions of years of how these ants change their bodies actually change to be better carriers of this helpful bacteria\nYeah and if you're a researcher on ants these are of changes are incredibly elaborate and fascinating and and there's many different varieties of changes in the structure but what what's really exciting for us is that the changes in the streets\nOrigins of these structures indicate these ants have been using these bacteria production antibiotics for tens of millions of years and that's what's particularly exciting but our study\nRight and this is interesting story a study in evolution or and it didn't happen just once you're saying\nYeah so so originally we we've known about these anti by producing bacteria for almost two decades now and originally it was thought it originated once in the association I'm maybe originated\nYou know relatively recently or ... or maybe ten million years ago we weren't really sure but what we show is that um [noise]\nUh not only did it evolve at the very early origin and association was you know therefore indicating it's really critical this success of the growing and the fungus garden by the ants\nBut that there's multiple origins of the structures that maintain it across the evolutionary history of the association and that indicates that there are strong selection on the ants\nTo protect their bacterial ...\nSo the ants have this evolutionary pressure in effect of the better a carrier they are for this bacteria that happier home they provide the more likely aren't they already have a successful fungus crop and in a way of what's in it for the bacteria do we know if the bacteria are ... are you know happier to be with these ants that bring him to the food they live\nYes that's a great question the so so the bacteria are only known to be so certain members of these bacteria are only known to be associated the and so so the ants provide the niche where were these bacteria curse it so that that's a major benefit but the other benefit they they they receive from the answers\nUnder these elaborate structures in inside the aunt or actual glands cells that are connected to the these Crips in these cavities\n'em through the channels and the the ants through the lands are are feeding the bacteria so the nutrients hotter the bacteria are derived from the and so it's really\nAnts cultivating and culturing bacteria with a on in in their bodies to produce these antibiotics\nAnd the story I'm hearing here is evolution in somebody's works more\nAnd more complicated ways then then I learned at the you know we learned that gives all runs faster to get away with it for the cheetah that she'd run faster catch up with a gives out these are different species coal evolving together I sort of competing with yet a third and fourth species but two different kinds of fungus yeah it's a\nWhole community of organisms that you know play different roles in one of the fascinating aspects of you know microbiology right now is the recognition of\nThe importance of beneficial microbes in the complexities communities as as you may know where there's a lot of research going on in the human micro biome and and the the microbes on our skin and our miles in our nose in and our guts mediating human health and\nAnd so this is a really great um system for for understanding how hosts and beneficial microbes evolve\nSo we might be interested as humans in studying things like how microbiomes can help us fight different kinds of diseases especially in the world of antibiotic resistance yeah\nAnd and that's a major part of their research with you in the lab is is thinking about I'm understanding um or any back resistance or in the system but also we look for new antibiotics from these bacteria in the ants were discovered a number of new I'm\nBut he was he was the first person to do so in a way that really really kind of affected people emotionally so there were composers before him um ... Perry for example who also created opera but they somehow didn't make the the same impact so what Monte Verde did\nAnd his genius was to create a form of song drama that really resonated that had people in tears that somehow impacted them in a way that\nFor a previous works in the genre had an so for example you know their ... their reports some people breaking down in tears at first performance of his work and something about the way that he set words to music was very powerful and you can just hear from that that tiny snippet\nAnd speaking of emotion it up or you introduced me to afraid I I wasn't promotes a mayor with but I Love it the rage are can yeah [laughter]\nWell Rachel are as as you know opera characters are often angry about something or they're frequently feeling betrayed and they're often feeling betrayed was very good reason because somebody's just done something terrible to them more runoff with someone else or they're heartbroken\nSo rage arias wore an important part of um a baroque genre of opera called opera Syria\nUm and handle for example road a lot of fabulous rage arias where the characters just kind of vent and lament and a mode and you just you just feel their anxiety so deeply\nWant to give a listen to another piece now and this was when he mentioned actually a Mozart ended the magic flew tigers and pay for that\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\nSo those earlier days the operas uh you're right we're really that elite audience is it by Mozart's time that we're starting to see a more a mass\nAppeal in the opera\nYes and and also in Mozart's time he did something that was with for example the marriage of Figaro he actually dared to rebel against the authorities a lot of the the offers written before Mozart\nWe're very we're very deferential to the people who commissioned them I mean Monte Verde for example was employed by the court [noise]\nUm I was was a Mozart slurp artist but what Mozart did during the time when he wrote the marriage of Figaro is he actually dared to kind of express this you know minor rebellion against the authorities which was fairly notable at the time\nAnd there were worries at some point food ... cultural commentator saying oh I'm worried this uh this opera is going to populist the common people are like you know that's that's wrong\nRight so basically in the world you've had this kind of strange situation where it's the pendulum has really swung between opera being this thing that was commission for and performed for royalty\nAnd then it somehow became a little more popular and then you had various very lofty and somber unimportant academic saying oh no we mustn't have this we have to keep it short and elitist and you know we don't want the common the common masses listening to this [noise]\nUm and then in the in the nineteenth and early ... century became much more popular and you had ... you had singers like Caruso who gave the first um Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast and reached enormous audiences\nAnd then later in the twentieth century I think the pendulum is kind of swung back a little bit and it's deemed again is somewhat elitist a couple of\nWomen and opera I Know Shakespeare and you're you're right about the comparison Shakespeare Shakespeare could read parts for women but boys had to play them because they could be up on stage what what are there similar things with opera over the years [noise]\nYes there were so at the beginning of opera I'm back in the seventeenth century you had this very unfortunate tradition of the strategy which are basically we're young boys who'd been castrated before puberty to ensure that their voices never broke\nAnd the reason that uh this horrible thing was was done was that was because women weren't allowed to saying publicly said they had to have men who had higher voices and kind of balanced out the choirs\nI'm later on their women were were allowed to saying I'm and interestingly opera was actually one of the few avenues that women had says I'm earning their own money you know at a time when women weren't allowed to own property or really had no rights at all [noise]\nSome of the famous um some of the best known women singers at the era were actually pretty successful in their own right\nVivian Schweitzer is with us pianist and former music critic for New York times we're
