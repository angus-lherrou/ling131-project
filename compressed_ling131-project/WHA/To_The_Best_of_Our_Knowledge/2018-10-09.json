coming up a new report says Wisconsin needs to do more in order to close race disparities in the state in higher education system will talk to one of the authors of that report in just a bit [noise]\nFirst the New York times investigation traces Donald Trump's financial history and it challenges the story you told on the campaign trail\nInvestigation finds that Donald Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his father over the years and that much of that money was passed on in ways aimed at skirting tax laws\nThe story draws on the interviews with former employees of Fred Trump Donald Trump played father as well as a hundred thousand pages of documents all which detailed the strategy of the Trump family used to avoid millions of dollars in taxes\nRoss viewed nerves investigative reporter for the New York times he was one of the reporters who broke this story Russ welcome to central time\nRob thanks for having me\nWell before we get into the details take us into how you and your colleagues got into the story where did the trial started for you I\nGuess it started originally during the two thousand six camp to two thousand sixteen campaign we were each working on various aspects of Mr Trump's business background um and then one day in September or one of my colleagues on this story suit Craig received three pages from Donald Trump's tax return from Nineteen Ninety five\nThat showed he had accumulated about a billion dollars in business losses that was allowing them to write off\nAll the incoming made for like another Eighteen years after that and we continued on that path and and then in a two thousand\nSeventeen and march of that year a one day on Rachel Maddow show she said she'd obtained some of his tax returns from two thousand five which showed by then he was making some income um\nAnd so we just started wondering what had changed and and became\nThrough that kind of exercise enthralled with uh the empire that his father had built and that the family had sold off just fear before that returned and were off on sort of a road that we didn't expect that uh that last last year and a half\nA year and a half a hundred thousand pages of documents leader\nLet's get into some of the takeaways here a Donald Trump on the campaign trail it told a story he'd gotten a million dollar loan with insurance from his father Fred Trump and that's what he built his empire on what a as you came to the conclusion here what did Donald Trump get from his father over the years [noise]\nWhile we were able to tabulate and current dollars was about four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and that money began flowing to him when he was just a three years old accelerated during the years and ah and accelerated greatly during the years when he was in financial duress himself\nRight died two hundred thousand a year I was considered a salary but starting at age three is that right\nKept a low profile didn't build flashy buildings are stuck to New York city we call the outer boroughs of Brooklyn and queens is where you work in Staten Island um and but he was always looking for a successor in his children\nAnd I'm Donald Trump was very clearly even though he was knocked the oldest son\nUm the ones who emerged to fill that role and was very different and obviously very different from an early age he drew attention to himself and any ways that he could one of the most interesting things to us was to find articles from the seventies or Donald Trump is talking about his projects the things he's built the things he owns\nTo reporters and actually he's taking them on a tour of buildings that his father build and his father owned some don't show up at that time did not own at all um and he began to sort of appropriate his father's wealth for to build his public persona and all those father was very different\nHe really seemed to admire that showmanship and Donald and that he could make things happen through that I'm being the showman that he was\nGoing to one of our callers now eight hundred six four to one two three four Jason is with us in Milwaukee Jason Hi\nHi how are you good what did you want to bring up\nSome uh some just wants to make a comment that as a a a Trump supporters I wanted to vote for him that I'm a sort of had this in the back of the art and by that I'm\nThere would be nothing because he actually won that there would be nothing but the ... minute I'm a investigations ... lately that Russian collusion it turned out to a nothing yet I'm and I'm a you know there's there's just a yet another thing that that kind of\nUm has sour grapes written all over it from from the other side and ... it's really getting old I'm ... I just wanted to make that call it\nJason thanks for the call Jason not alone I similar things have been sad or in the Republican world Ross why bother at this point uh the elections long gone why keep digging into the Trump family's finances\nHere we're not trying to change the election I mean this is a process that anyone enters public life goes through there is a way they represent themselves to the people and uh usually the campaign process a little bit longer and Donald Trump's case\nAnd we're gonna continue to look at things that explain his long life and business um and and now he's represented that before he ever came into a public life usually by time someone runs for president they've run for governor or senator or whatever else and they've\nBeen sort of added in that way and their life story has been looked at Donald Trump that's just not the case he was a television personality and a kind of a an interesting ... figure that people didn't uh take\nSeriously on this level of so this is a usual sort of process that he's going to go through and that historians will continue to review a now for decades to come\nSeason thanks for that call yeah the out all county building supply maintenance and we were talking about earlier as far as you could tell a that's the first reporting on that that was the first you had heard of it was new to a lot of people\nGet that's never been mentioned publicly before that's right and neither has the the trust or um the Trump Palace a investments thing that we mentioned in there all of this was totally new\nNow there's a lot we don't know you mentioned a couple of dribs and drabs of information about some more recent tax filings what what don't we have from President Trump that we might have had from most other presidential candidates in recent years\nWhile every presidential candidate for the last forty years uh for the major parties has released there were all of their recent tax returns under the idea that people should be able to see\nWhat other sources of their income and that people should be able to determine for themselves whether that represents any conflicts too\nWith the actions that they might be taking a Donald Trump just chose not to do that first said that it was because he was under audits although he's never shown that there were actually audits taking place and\nHe's rejected any notion that some of those audits from the nineties or the early to thousands must be complete by now and he could release those and he's just sort of maintain this a hard hard part and position on that\nGo to another caller now Jack is with us and Chippewa falls jak hello hello or would you want to bring up jak\nWhile I guess what I'm saying is the populist candidate that we put in and I guess we're all responsible or has really old or over our eyes with multiple bankruptcy is tax evasion from from what we're hearing here today or this\nThis is a you know the guy that runs the populist apparently or as full a lot of people\nRight jak got thanks for calling in let's talk a little bit about the bankruptcies Ross another angle in this story is when Donald Trump side business enterprises had to run into hard times sometimes they're helped or bailed out by again Fred drop and you talk about how that happened\nSure I've certainly the darkest years in Donald Trump's financial existence where a ride around Nineteen Ninety he had bought a bunch of\nHigh profile assets a prominent New York hotel he had built very expensive casinos he had bought a ... from a Saudi prince and he did this with a extraordinary levels of debt that the enterprises couldn't support\nAnd my Nineteen Ninety it was all collapsing around him or some of his lenders were threatening to force them into bankruptcy and to foreclose and take all these properties and assets away I'm at that point in time the support from his father increased greatly his father also started paying themselves much more um and we wonder if\nOther amounts of that money went to Mr Trump that we haven't found yet but one example was I think I mentioned it early earlier was investment that uh\nFred Trump made and Trump Palestine partner project that Donald Trump was building at the time\nIn Nineteen eighty seven Donald Trump about his father\nThat first Fifteen million dollars into an investment in the Trump Palace apartment building that I mentioned [noise] and then four years later\nI'm his father sold those shares back\nTo his son for ten thousand dollars coincidentally a week after Donald Trump they'd received is ten thousand dollar Christmas Chuck from his father [noise] um so that basically was a gift of Fifteen million dollars right at his son's darkest hour\nAnd then too complicated and to take a move that we've been told is is illegal or Fred Trump than wrote that\nThat off that Fifteen million dollars off as an investment loss on his income taxes which saved him about five million dollars in income taxes um and we're told that those sort of they're called related party transactions are not legal\nAnd one weird story or a representative of fried shrimp going into a New Jersey casino buying millions of dollars worth of chips and not placing a bet\nThat's a great one to yes he was that was Donald Trump on that week\nWas going to have to make a payment on his bonds has basically his loans I'm uh in order to keep his casinos\nAnd he didn't have the money for it his father sent in a loyal aid or to buy three and a half million dollars in gambling ships and just put them back in the car and drive back to queens uh ultimately the authorities figured out that that was what had happened and that that was\nAn illegal alone and Fred Trump years later was required to cash those ships back in\nBut it's certainly a got his son over the hump of on that given day\nSpring on one more caller Mike is with us in ... below Mike hello\nHi yes just had a question for your guest today you know you talked about the investigation they did as far as the tax stuff did they go beyond just the Trump into that because to be able to accomplish these activities there has to be others involved as far as the person that the\nValues you know and correctly on the\nBuildings and you know the fact that even though these things down very blatant apparently it at officials didn't bother to look at so I mean with the lax government for this corruption out all this to happen Micah thanks Ross\nSure it's a good question Mike thanks so\nIn some cases there's no indication that the taxing authority is look at these things we were talking about all county earlier the Trump Palace a investment last right off there is no hint that we see in the tax turns that we have the IRS was aware of anything on toward their or what the actual\nMechanics were what was transpiring there in the case of the trust we were talking about the valuations the IRS\nDid look at it um they did come back and say these valuations are too low and they required that Trump's to pay I Believe was about in that case five million dollars more in taxes um but that was nowhere near the actual under evaluation that it appears that they missed were told by\nVery prominent trust in his state attorneys weeks consulted on this um that that's very common that the IRS is typically very out gunned on these large complex returns that they don't hire their own appraisers generally to go out and look and see what the properties we're really worth\nThey just sort of say this seems low and if they can get five million dollars more they would call that a win\nThey've all we've all seen them since they're bringing less students from Wisconsin come in um you know that that those rates are going to small so we're still seeing around Ninety to little over a hundred students depending year to year black students graduating from you W Madison even though the graduation rate has gone up\nI Want to highlight that first point you made there because it seems like that some of the big takeaways from this report the percentage of black high school graduates going to college here in Wisconsin yes I was already low compared to a to white students and it's gone down significantly yes\nSo that seems to be how big a starting point and that'll take us into some of your recommendations are we talking to Matthew brown getting brown getting from the group cows looking at racial and ethnic disparities in higher education here in Wisconsin\nSo let's start with that a ... worsening gap in terms of the number of high school students of color black students particular going into our colleges you what kind of things do you think a ... report what kinds of things could help turn that around yeah I'm so with with you know one of the\nThings and then it actually I I Wish we put in a report that I that I came to my mind after we published it was um getting rid of a access tests\nUm so you think of like a C te SAT which is not to you know when you look at what's the aren't indicative of a really a performance it's more so indicative of how well you take those specific tests and all sorts of couple of things so that's something that that is an ... that is is a big thing but when it comes to\nAh it can continue throughout that pre college programs have have shown to work or a quite a bit across the country\nI'm In it's it's definitely one of the things that we we recommend continue investing in that I ... I Do want to say all of our recommendations are really contingent on the state of Wisconsin read investing in these public institutions they have to have\nThe resources to be able to spend on recruiting and bringing in and preparing students for their universities yeah it's a point\nThe report these problems are at a W and to a lesser extent the technical college system they aren't problems that we're necessarily caused by those school right right\nAnd and even then you know some of this this is definitely things that is even within their hands granted you know as as we've seen a decline within our K. to twelve twelve system that's going to impact us students coming in to these schools but at the same time when they get here\nThat's on the schools are again they still have to have the resources to help the students to to hire more ... advisors in culture come to an visors to help create a a cultural centers and to help students feel welcome out of camp camp is one of the biggest things we've seen a wide students end up\nTransferring out particular VW Madison or leaving or even post graduation as as we see with a brain drain of students of color on campus\nIs that feeling of being welcome or not um and the creation of of dedicated space it for students of color and cultural competence spaces and advisors and professors or that looked like that that have diverse backgrounds\nHelp create a a welcoming atmosphere um as well as at times even more of a enhanced a\nA syllabus for for classes and\nSo one point you make the report I'm paraphrasing loosely here uh you make the case that if the goal is to increase attendance rates and graduation rates for students of color or there has to be not colorblind top policies they have to reach out directly to like in this case that African Americans absolutely\nOr you can't undo years of targeted and purposeful um racialized and an ethnic oppression with colorblind policies the only way to undo the types of policies and and\nThe the legacy impact an ongoing impact and ongoing practice is through targeted a policies and actions that on do that purposefully undo a racialized than an ethnic oppression\nAnother recommendation in the report is more on the economics of college a lot often you know the caller are from lower income backgrounds can you talk about what you'd be looking for that\nYeah so it again I I Do want to give a andme ATC and and then you'd have UMass and shot out with um you know they have the batter promising ATC has tuition promises for students\nUm this is huge uh when it comes to those tuition costs\nIn helping students come to these institutions really goes a long way and increasing access as well as graduation um college costs ... you can back in the day you know my dad could could you know go work for summer and pays tuition\nI Can't do that anymore um so that's absolutely help students that that I'm going to be disproportionately students of color as well as coming from from low income backgrounds bought the costs of college do not stop at tuition\nOn one of the biggest obstacles that we've seen um is is housing security and and food security thirty six percent of students nationally or housing insecure another thirty six percent are food insecure\nWe know these things have a direct causation and correlation with um with how you perform at school and if you actually can maintain attendance throughout the impact as massive when students don't have these things\nSo the economic support for things beyond tuition like that as well as even childcare as we've seen a rise and more a single parents are going back to school or even going to school for for the first time on these kind of a holistic approach to supporting um students is is that\nWe're talking to Matthew brown getting right now senior associate at cows and nonprofit think tank based at U.
