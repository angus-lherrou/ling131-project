R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nIs to the best of our knowledge I'm answering champs what is it like to care about someone bad someone evil\nYou know I almost remember the day like it was yesterday replays in my mind a lot and\n[noise]\nI was a [noise] a ship that night [noise] we got the call over the radio it was time to wake them up\nRight where the\nSource there and watch them get ready and visitors here but his suit on his watch um [noise] you got dressed to the ... and we all knew that it was coming [noise] you ... before he walked into the\nThe ducks house and the\nMore we turn around and said goodbye said they were all his friends and\nWhy [noise]\nUh\nThe sound of the execution of Saddam Hussein\nHe was hanged in two thousand six following his trial in Baghdad an\nAdam Rogers some was an American soldier\nOne of the super twelve assigned to guard Saddam Hussein during this trial\nMany just out of basic training spent months alone in close quarters\nWith a man the rest of the world reviled as the butcher of Baghdad they were there at the hanging\nAs you can hear Adam is still haunted by what happened\nWe'll Barton Webber was also serving in Iraq at the time he was an airborne\nLet's such young inexperienced soldiers were targeting central value prisoner and what effect that might have been ... talking with Adam Adam with will just come out with a book about the secret twelve\nHouse [noise]\nYou know when they went over there I think they were expecting to tend to do what soldiers expect to do which is get into combat situations and potentially engage with and and kill bad guys and that's why a lot of these guys joined to begin with\nSure a lot of these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nYeah exactly that a lot of them joined us out of a sense of patriotism and and yes I think when they got this assignment they had a mixed response on the one hand um you know I think they were intrigued by the idea that they would be\nWith Saddam Hussein but I think some of them were kind of bummed out that they weren't going to be outside the wire sort of mixing it up with the insurgents and that they'd be kind of stuck in in one place\nThat was a little surprised that these guys didn't have special training after some bunch of high level CIA guy should be guarding Saddam Hussein but some kids their kids from like you know higher that seems strange to me\nYeah no I mean they were in some cases not far removed from basic training\nTo Eighteen yeah I mean it was it was remarkable they weren't special operators they weren't CIA clandestine service personnel I mean they were just a basic young soldiers um and then that combined with kind of the intimacy of their\nTo his people as this defiant leader a strong leader and so that's really what do you use the trial to do was to project that image\nYou know during the trial she accused some of the guards of torture it while they were there how did the guard she would be starting a relationship with this man how did they react to this feeble old man they were taking care of now this define angry man accusing them of things that weren't true\nYeah I mean there's a an account from one of the guards that he was on the same day he was in court wave in about how he had been mistreated by the Americans he got into the elevator to bring it back down into the subterranean cell where they were holding him\nAnd he laughed and he said hey don't worry about that that was basically just for the cameras and how you treat me ... me great [noise]\n\nThe trial and we all know with an execution hanging can you tell me about that day what happened at the execution\nYou know I almost remember that day like it was yesterday it replays in my mind a lot [noise]\nI was a shift at night and we all knew that it was coming close [noise]\nYou know we broke his radio so you couldn't hear\nAnd uh [noise]\nWe got the call over the radio it was time to wake them up\nAnd\nWe did and he knew [noise]\nSo I stood there and watch them get ready and\nFix his hair but his suit on his watch on\nHe got address to the nines as best as he could [noise] once that was done I left him and then we all had the mentally prepare for what was about to go down that was that was pretty intense because you figure\nIf someone is going to come get him or he was planning to escape he's going to do it now [noise] so that was that was a very intense time just cleaning their weapons and making sure everything was a point with her so [noise] yeah once we got there [noise]\nHe said goodbye to us so [noise] I mean [noise]\nNobody wins or whatever and I'm Sorry ... mhm what did he say to you\nYou personally how did you say goodbye to you\nIt was very it was very sad once the commotion was over and we knew we were in somewhat of a safe zone\nNo one was going to come and get him [noise] he ... to before he walked into the [noise] but that's how the [noise]\nHe turned around and say goodbye [noise] said that we were all his friends [noise]\nSome of us were crying and he was sad [noise]\nBut just for that split second just see him as a mulch and state\nIt was a crazy we've done in firefights we've been through IDs [noise] but at that nothing can prepare you for that type of situation [noise]\n\nImmediately after they\nWork so hard to comport themselves in a professional dignified manner and to treat him the way they were supposed to and then it kind of all went to hell and uh I mean execution itself\nKind of just resembled a disorganized sort of mob scene and then in the moments after the execution went Saddam's body was getting mistreated you know they were forced to essentially stand there and watch that [noise]\nI think that I was a [noise]\nI really didn't know what to feel I'd I've never seen anything\nJust like wow that\nWas a wild wild west to me was\nLike I've only seen the movies\nTo hear it all go down and it was [noise]\nI was more protected than I was sad because [noise]\nWhen you're asked to protect someone like that and don't supposed to hurt him in the interest have their ... brain and it's easy to influence for twenty two year old\nWhen you see a chicken ... body [noise]\nI just I just have more respect the presence of the I guess [noise]\nAnother one of the soldiers would speak very candidly about any number of insurgents that he had killed and he didn't have any real regret remarks about that\nBut this experience I had a profound impact on him and so you have to step back and say okay well why was it that he was able to kill from a distance and almost joke about it off handily but here we are with essentially the worst of our enemies\nAnd playing a role in that particular death really hurt him in trouble with him [noise]\nI feel like I have to explain why it bothered me so much for an American to be upset\nBut for us to stand by and let them treated another human being that way I thought that's what we were over here to stop the treatment like that\nI truly felt that I was just as guilty as anybody else [noise]\nI've never really had a conscience about anything I've ever done over here as far as humanity goes I've seen some pretty bad things\nIn my job I had never before said that I had to stand there and watch people have been on a person's body [noise] and you know what I'm Glad I feel that way I really didn't feel that way I Would think something was wrong [noise]\nSo would you say that I mean I Want to use this word lightly but are you traumatized by what happened in Iraq\nOh absolutely a hundred a hundred percent um I live with the though those demons every day but don't get a twisted like he he was tried for his crimes and that is the judgment that they came down with and I'm not saying that he didn't deserve it\nI'm saying that as a twenty two year old soldier maybe I wasn't ready for that\nI think though I wasn't the one who drop the four oh\nSometimes I feel like I did\n[noise]\nAdam Rogers from was one of the soldiers in Iraq guarded Saddam Hussein\nWill barred and weapons book about them is called the prisoner and the palace and Charles Monroe Cain talked with both of them ...\nHere's my question\nHow can someone the monster\nSaddam Hussein's case torturing and killing thousands of people he gassed his own subjects and the clothes seem like these from\n... in other words what happens when the moral categories good or bad\nThat we sort of people into fall apart\nInstead of the best of my knowledge from Wisconsin Public

[noise]\nI had this incident happened around eighth grade was a basketball camp in Fargo North Dakota\nAnd there was a kid at this camp in retail who was at least in our age group by far the best player he was posing skill very talented but at least from my perception\nAt that time an awful person maybe the worst person I've ever\nMet [noise] he was extremely egocentric and he seemed obsessed with sex which\nI Know is a normal thing for an eighth grader but I just found it very comfortable and you know didn't listen to the coach\nWas always arguing with the referee\nKind of bullying bigger really stayed in my mind [noise]\nI remember going to high school we went to different high schools but he was a good athlete showed his name was in the paper and then you know he ended up becoming a major league baseball player [noise]\nSo I followed this guy's career I still feel the same way I did in junior high so like I'm reading the newspaper hoping to see that Rick ... shells [noise]\nHe wins twenty games one year and I'm just so disappointed you mentioned in the world series and I'm just I'm mad the old time [noise]\n\nI wrote a piece for Esquire basically about this war and make this passing reference to heavy arch enemy [laughter] and then he retires and I'm like oh well I just end the story\nReading at an issue of time magazine and the dentist [laughter]\nThat Rick ... this guy who I'd spent my whole life sort of viewing as the antithesis of me my arch enemy was pretty much the first player in major league baseball to stand up and take a stand against anabolic steroids\nLike no one listened to him but he was the first guy to be on record going like look this is the problem\nIt's screwing the game up in this can be consequences if we don't step and\nThen of course now in the wake of what has happened everyone looks back and go like oh we're killing was this truth pioneer so I just had to come to the realization that the one person I Am on record for Haiti\nIs probably one of the most important baseball players of the last forty years despite the fact that his success on the field was very marginal his import was that she refused to allow something that was wrong you happenings without sort of standing up and saying we need to change this [laughter]\nSo you know that's kind of my life like people I have ended up being a hero [noise]\nChuck Close to him and he's a cultural critic and author most recently of X A highly specific defiantly incomplete history of the twenty first century [noise]\n... it's the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio N.\nLater today on this American Life huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being that I'm reading the diary kept as a teenager is Jewish and a lot of big ideas if the situation continues when I'm a bit older\nThan watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes Adam was on Capitol revisiting your own childhood later today\nAt two on the ideas network [noise]\nSupport for WPRI comes from the riverside theater in Milwaukee presenting violinist ...

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nWe debated when we were putting this show together about whether you would really want to hear this many stories about mass murderers serial killers\nBut you know can I thought about what's on my Amazon and Netflix cues and probably an yours\nBreaking Bad Hannibal game of Thrones we like shows with killers I mean like all killers like bad people in fiction to think of crime and punishment Frankenstein Lolita\nSo there's a theory that reading fiction helps us learn to understand other people and in the process we become kinder better more empathetic\nJoshua Landis is a professor of French and complex at Stanford and he agrees sort of\nI think it makes you a better person if it doesn't make you a nicer person [laughter]\nUh I think it it gives you a richer life um and I think it makes you battered all kinds of important mental skills but I I'm\nCases it makes you more altruistic\nHaven't there been studies done connecting you know the development of empathy with fiction\nAnd I as a really interesting question what they've shown is that\nYou get a little bit better at what they called theory of mind which is reading the mental states other individuals\nBut there's actually quite a big gap between that and being nicer to people\nThese same psychologists have figured out the bullies for example have a fairly high capacity for theory of mind bullies are very good at figuring out what makes somebody else chicken that's how they managed to torment them as effectively as they do so there are various\nUnfortunate lines of behavior that depend on you having a pretty developed sense of what other people are thinking and feeling\nWell that's very creepy I guess I Would have thought that the experience of reading and getting emotionally invested in a character it's not just cold lay understanding how their mind works it's an act as\nActive sympathy acted empathy you could invest it in the character you care about them maybe you come to loved him that's rather different from just developing a theory if their minds don't you think\nWell that's totally true um but again you you just have to look at the\nAt the data there'll be plenty of people who've had that experience with literature and gone on not necessarily be very nice people ... ... talk if the example of a tyrant Alexander for a U.S who used to weep tragedies and then go back to having his citizens torn apart by dogs\nAnd you know the famous examples that people like ... who was a big fan of Shakespeare and my favorite which is similar who loved Sid Harter which is ... ...\nNovel [laughter] so I'd argue that those are outliers right I mean yeah there are always going to be a few completely pathological human beings\nYou can argue that means Suzanne Keenan has done a fair amount of research on this and she tells his lovely anecdote of assigning her students in a class books about people in India in Haiti and she asked the students you know how to this change you and it turns out they called their mother is more of it\nIs a very nice but what you get here is basically the influence of in group biased so there is absolutely caring for characters and\nEmpathizing your way into them and it may even invoke some kind of a warm fuzzy feeling but it's very like that warm fuzzy feeling is going to get directed onto your own in group very often we like to think that the point of reading works of fiction", "year": "2018", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "city": "Madison", "day": "28"}
