last\nYear a fourteen percent increase from the year before we'll find out why more care is going on paid for and how the costs get passed on first election day is getting closer with just under a month before voters head to the polls the Marquette University law school poll has been tracking the statewide races in this year's midterm elections\nResults from their latest survey are out today\nCharles Franklin is the director and the founder of bolstered dot com\nCharles welcome back to the show or good to be here let's dive into some of the big ticket races trials that people are watching for and start with the race for governor what uh what did you see what's been changing\nOut this month we have a toss up forty six percent for ... forty seven for Walker a that's obviously well within the margin of error we had a one point margin\nOr a month ago or three weeks ago in September ... led forty nine to forty four\nSo the shift is a down three points for ... up three points for Walker um in our August ... we had the race a dead by so I'd say over these three polls we've seen some hint that ... might have an advantage last month\nBut we're back to a clear a toss up this month so I'm the upshot I think is that this looks like a very competitive race other polling of the race has shown large ... advantages of as much as seven recently but also as little as two\nSo there's been a range of polling in the race but I think a toss up is about where the race looks right now\nNow when you are to eating out the poll results I'm watching for those and I'm also watching for the first people to say you over sampled ... members of one party or the other and that explains the results can you talk about how you a sample by party and how that fits into the the final product\nSure well almost all polling that uses legitimate random sampling um draws the sample as well as we can but doesn't declare ahead of time what the party balance will be and that's certainly true of my polling\nSo the party split that we get is a result of what people tell us and the particular survey not something that I get to make up what I think the party balance in the state would be and so it is what it is\nThe movement of from last time to this time is a movement from a a democratic advantage in the previous fall to a a three point Republican advantage in the current Paul\nAnd that's inside the margin of error how much it moved from last time to this time but it does affect other things in the poll the key point to remember here though is that we saw the governor's race\nParty has done\nAnd there are no worse than\nJust like today I met several people that are ... three times a week and just love coming out and I asked him about my retirement often and\nAnd I asked people what would they do ... what we do is they basically say they don't go out\nAnd I don't know either [noise]\nIt'll my wife would like to retire and\nIf neither one way or the other to me

H. W. dot org slash T. F. C.\nRight right that's a good point to make 'em across the nation it's thirty eight billion so I mean it's a lot of money we're talking about\nThe hospitals aren't getting money for the medical services they provide and in Wisconsin it hasn't reached this level\nFor since twenty fourteen and then as I said earlier was when the ... started now that's not the entire reason you can't\nSay that's the only reason we're seeing medical debt rise or fall there's also prices medical costs are going up um we're told the economy is faring better but wages have been stagnant\nAnd do we know how this is distributed around the state\nWhere the brunt of it the Milwaukee County I'm thirty percent of all uncompensated care as Milwaukee County now of course it's the most populous county\nBut it's not thirty percent of the state right right exactly [laughter] I don't [laughter] yeah so it's a disproportionate amount in the biggest and it makes sense it's in many ways the highest population of low income people in the state\nExactly so you have a double whammy\nAre there efforts in the works to to try to deal with this problem and and try to bring down this unpaid medical data hospitals\nWell there are a number of things I'm One of them of course was getting more people insurance um Governor Walker is also try to lower premiums we've seen a spike in premiums under the Affordable CARE Act and through something known as reinsurance\nWhich is a fancy way of saying basically the federal government and state is subsidizing some of these high costs medical claims\nBut that is only going to a ... effect a portion of the market is not going to affect a widespread swaths of people\nWhat impact does it's unpaid medical that have on hospitals and the care they provide the billion one point one million dollars doesn't just magically disappear\n[noise] well like everything else they pass it along to you and I ... I mean it's a business and they have to recoup these costs so people they do have insurance are seeing a little boost in their bails\nYou've been reporting on this issue over the years and it's something you get the sense of for politicians and health care providers this is something they see as an urgent hot button issue or is this is this just something that's kind of a a steady drumbeat there's always going to be some debt out there\nWell we've seen debt higher than this in previous years and there wasn't really action\nTo deal with it so now it may come to a head just because health care is such a big issue in this election however you see preexisting conditions taking more of a prominent role bad debt and the business side of things is less so\nHowever medical bill unpaid medical bills could crop up again\nSamantha thanks for shouting some light on this for us thanks Rob she\nKnows is a reporter for WPRI news she joined us to talk about the rising unpaid medical costs in Wisconsin the top a billion dollars in twenty Seventeen\nComing up result of a new study find that while many adolescent girls feel more empowered to pursue a variety of careers boys seem to continue to feel constricted by gender norms learned more in just a bit I'm Rob ferrets stick around there's more to come on central time you're listening to the idea of network [noise]\nUm in terms of you know one of the most surprising things to me in these data is just the degree to which girls and boys are in an environment just immersed in ... in sort of ah the sexual they should in an object of vacation of\nGirls and women um but yeah as Claire said so boys get the message that I'm the most important trait in Boise is strengthen toughness girls it's being physically attractive\nHalf of girls look in the mirror at least once a day and imagine how others might see them that's compared to thirty one percent hum of boys in the end I was speaking to this environment the sort of sexual as environment two thirds of girls said they're exposed several times more or more\nTo women and girls and the media who have unrealistic bodies\nHalf said that several times a week or more they see female characters and TVs and or movies whose bodies and looks are more important than their abilities\nUm a majority of girls say they hear boys making sexual comments or sexual jokes about girls at least several times a week and when you look at teen girls so fourteen to to Nineteen year olds\nForty seven percent almost half a teen girls say they hear boys making a sexual comments or sexual jokes about girls every day\nAnd even one in four younger girls shares the here's these comments every day and get in boys pretty much stay the same thing they say um [noise]\nYou know they're likely to hear these comments or in Hollywood ah they're like here males a ... characters and TV in Hollywood making sexual comes in jokes about women half of boys ages fourteen and Nineteen have heard male family members make sexual jokes or sexual comments about women and\nAnd hearing the especially sharing those comments sexual jokes and sexual comments about women is correlated with a lot of\nA a a lot of surprising things in the in the survey too and and sort of a um other types of pressure around um you know hiding your feelings and a habit\nToward women and and more likely to be feel it's OK to ask a girl for naked or sexy pictures so yeah we have a lot of findings there around just sort of just the climate uh around a women girls and and you know sexual ... objective vacation\nAnd you also spent time interviewing several sixth grade students with the lower end of this age range surveys and you talk to them about their experience with gender what kind of a responses did you hear how did the match up with these survey results [noise]\nThey were actually in eighth grade um but I'm very close to that age and they are really reflected what the survey showed so\nAt this middle school that I went to there are a couple of girls on the football team girls made up the vast majority of the student council members\nThey said they wanted to be you know scientists when they grow up and lawyers when they grow up they said math and science for their favorite subjects they said they really felt that they were equal in school and in their lives to boy that people treated them that way\nUm until that confidence was on display at the same time they said that despite all that\nThey felt that what society value most in them\nWith their looks and the you know they felt either that they were hearing from their parents um\nYou know it's important to grow up to be a Good Wife or they were hearing you know from the media that I'm being physically attractive was the most important thing or they were hearing from boys who you know ask them for sexy pictures on a regular basis by text message things like this um where they were\nThey were really getting on those those double messages that the data found it and then the boys I interviewed on it was slightly heartbreaking because they you know talked about\nSome of them talked about how they played sports and they thought you know being tough was would they also had a disconnect\nWhere they said the most important to them\nWas to be confident and ambitious that they thought that what society value more in them was to be tough and strong and\nSome of them played sports and said they didn't feel comfortable expressing their emotions\nExcept when they were playing sports and then they felt like they could get themselves the freedom to get fired up as one said\nOthers who didn't play sports said that they felt a lot of pressure to do so at one said that he didn't feel like he was a real man because he he wasn't physically strong and he didn't do activities like that he had started\nA coating club at school and wanted to be a computer scientist um and and was really feeling the pressure that this was not the traditional expectation one said that he had wanted to play volleyball and um apparently that\nIs a girl sport and so he had been made fun of for that and so you know what the survey found what other research has found and what these boys described to me is that there's much less flexibility for boys there is under a much narrower roles that are expected to be in and going outside of those roles at all\nOn you get a lot of feedback that that's the wrong thing to do in a way that girls rules have really expand that much more\n...
