debate happened a I'm a native uh brewer's playoff game or you W badgers game in some ways for a big race this debate was under the radar do you feel like it it didn't get as much attention is there's a debate like this usually would\nUh honestly most of the base we have 'em in Wisconsin don't get the kind of attention like a presidential debate would where you have millions of dollars for a number of reasons I mean they\nAre off on weekend nights at October when they're football games going on other stuff happening they're just not really\nA tension grabbers and so really most people that I talked to around politics and they watch the ... they're looking for a gaffe is there a big moment that could live on to hunt a candidate not really the media coverage but in paid media you know TV radio digital ads\nThat can be used but other than that I mean they don't expect you to be game changers the grand scheme of things at least in the ... campaigns\nI Know you can always tell is sort of thing in real time but are people talking about a moment like that at this debate where hey yeah here's something somebody just wrote the other side campaign ad\nKnown about for you know looking at social media reaction and talked to a cafe I've that sense that there was something major out of those it was interesting the first debate was a week ago today and then that's what they you know leave ... there was\nClearly a more aggressive um candidate in that forum and that's probably be expected and then she's been down double digits most polls that I've seen the last month\nAndrea dubbing of lifestyle editor for American Girl magazine and the author of the new book spark a guide to ignite the creativity inside you Andrea welcome to central time thanks for having me today well what led you to want to tackle this subject try to inspire creativity for for kids girls in particular\nThere [laughter] yeah it was actually inspired a lot of my work with American Girl magazine I've been a lifestyle editor there for about nine years and the bulk of the content I create is creativity focus so crafts and recipes and that sort of thing so it really grew out of that experience\nAnd people might think well kids they're creative why do they need a book\nRight yeah you know I think it really depends on the age of the head of for me I create specifically for the male great audience which is kind of that early pre teen\nGroup and that's really the age where kids are getting more um self conscious and kind of experiencing more of the inner credit I think he would call it when it comes to topics like creativity so this book is really I'm kind of helping them at that face and there could have development\nYou know there's a I've I've seen studies of big changes I don't know what kind of answer you're talking about here in this book is for eight plus the plus okay so that's when you start to see in studies or interest in science and technology changing a interest in different kinds of arts changing a lot of things to this is kind of a key a turning point in some ways it is yet\nSo take us through now spark and how you try to spark their creativity\n[noise] yeah well I'm the book really opens with defining creativity and it was really important for me in the book itself\nTo cast a really broad definition of what creativity is because I think that's part of the problem is that we often define it in a really narrow way especially with kids um if they're not artistic or draw or you know painter right they don't often think they're creative so from the gecko in the book I really try to define creativity very broadly\nTo cover a lot of different disciplines\nUm and then after that I kind of go into the creative process itself through a force that process to have a kind of lay out throughout the book there give us the overview of that process yeah the overview of the four main steps that I cover our make tanker a ... imagine\nMake tanker finish and um that really is taking kids from the ideas face um and then bringing them through kind of what the rough draft phase the ... the styling or the kind of um refining phase and then finishing it and sending the idea on to the world\nI Want to talk about the refining say is what I Love you talk about the kind of a scientific method for creativity can you give you a big into that a little more\nRight yeah you know the scientific method is in here um if the the child is actually dealing with the craving that creative idea that relates to 'em that sort of discipline um did they create a Methodist\nUm has to do with getting feedback and I'm dealing with discouragement and that sort of thing um so from a creative from a general perspective uh that's what kind of the book goes into stock and Andrea\nDubbing all through the new book spark a guide to ignite the creativity inside you are helping to a spark and get a little method an inspiration especially to young girls and help them be creative in in different phases of life\nYou got to give some role models or are we out all women who who could inspire creativity and again not just you know painting and what we think\nOf as art and creativity right um there's a section of the book that deals with women from throughout history so women in the past but also women who are still around and creating today and then I also pulled in some words from women who aren't necessarily famous but they are out in the world today creating in some capacity um and I thought it was important to have\nMany different women represented in this book again to kind of show with a broad range of what it means to be creative and the different ways that that can play out in a person's life\nOr a piece of the book that I really like is dealing with a criticism and discouraging when you talked about the inner critic their\nOuter critics to talk about how you are you talk to younger girls about getting feedback getting positive feedback and how to deal with the less useful stuff\nRight yeah so for the feedback portion of it um I give girls like three different criteria that they should use when evaluating feedback from other people um and the first is really 'em knowing that you don't have to get feedback from every one that to be selective about the feedback\nI'm also asking good questions when you're getting feedback about your work not just is this good but ah you know questions that could maybe help um refined the work of it and then the third step would be um to decide whether or not to use the feedback\nBecause just because someone makes a comment about the work you're creating doesn't mean you have to use it and that's that's the part that's in the book to\nAnd then as far as the the criticism and the discouragement um that'd be feedback that comes from people that's not helpful or as mean spirited and there's a section in the book that talks about that too and it\nFlips around to it but it's kind of guidance on how to do good feedback right yeah can you talk about how we can think of the feedback we might deliver to be even tougher you know forty eight year old male Sadat not just a middle school\nGirls right yeah there's a section in the book that um I called creative critique and it's really taking the reader through the process of like you said giving good feedback on creative work I'm the first is just really to observe and describe what you're seeing you know if you're evaluating someone else's creative work\nI'm the second would be seeing the good in it and pulling out it's strong points that maybe the creator can build on\nUm the third would be spotting the problems I'm not necessarily um I don't like this but pointing out areas where there might be um room to change or or grow and then the force it'd be thinking of solutions to the problems that you just pointed out\nTalked about most of your book is exercises for those four different stages can you share one or two of the exercises up but somebody might be able to try it home\nYeah um let me just look through here quick um there is a couple of pages that I called brain breaks and those are totally just for fun pages where um it's not connected to any sort of created activity um but the brain break for instance has um pictures of\n'em made up animals and birds and flowers and that sorts of things and then they readers encouraged to just brainstorm a name\nFor those um and then in the next page it's kind of the opposite where we give you a name like Blair you've learned a cake is something that's I'm In the book or a gadget called ... that and then the reader has to do it all that and kind of come up with okay what would this look like if this\nBeep both in your work at American Girl magazine and then in response you've had so far from the book what kinds of things do you hear from girls in this age range where they talk about creativity and maybe things that have that have helped them re embrace it\nYeah um I think you know one thing I've heard and this is at some events that have done for the the books launch is just um and appreciation for encouraging a broader view of creativity because I'm I've seen all sorts of the kids\nThat they come to a these events but um I think one thing I've heard is as kids who didn't necessarily think they are creative when they see the thing that they like to do like robotics are solving equations or something in the book\nIt's helped them realize oh I Am creative because you know I I enjoy um things that are in here that I'm actually talking about in relation to creativity\nSo looking in your book it's like that's the big win for you when you add for my kid yet I didn't know ours creative but I Am yes yet\nAnd we hear a often now from the business community a skill or we've talked about this on the show a skilled at they're looking for and employees is creativity and not necessarily yeah we want people come in and do fabulous portraits for us but our creative thinking are you\nA are you selling this in part to uh teachers parents and kids as of this could actually help you and your career\nDown the road I absolutely I honestly wrote this for adults as much as I read it for kids and I've\nHad a lot of adults that have actually read the book and said you know I Know I'm not in your age group [laughter] but I totally love it and I got a lot of great things out of out of it and to be honest I still get things from this book because the things that I wrote are things that I Need to be reminded of too so I think I'm no matter where you're at or what age you are this could be helpful book for you yeah I was going to ask\nDo you find the lessons you've you know the creativity you put into making the book inspiring you to to try to think creatively now that you're talking about\nThat I Do absolutely um there are times that I find myself rereading parts of it and thinking oh I should probably put that into practice more\nNow are there are probably more parents and teachers listening right now than actual eight year old so I'll be honest with you so I can you leave us with a message for those parents and teachers to not let that creativity go away as a kid up or elementary and middle school\nYeah I Would just again as I said I'm to encourage their child to have a broader view of creativity and to not be discouraged by um things they make not turning out the first time you know understanding that creativity is a process and that part of that process is failure in practice and getting better over time\nOr even their Andrea thanks a lot for joining us today thank you Andrea dubbing of lifestyle editor for American Girl magazine she's the author of the new book we've been talking about spark a guide to ignite the creativity inside you\nLove to hear from you have you maintained or maybe re ignited creativity at some stage in your life tell us what you did how you did it and how it's working for you you can email ideas that WPRI dot org\nOr you can always tweet us at Central time WPRI be as creative as you want\nComing up we'll trace the history of two terms that come up a lot in our politics today the American dream and America First talked to the author of a new book called the whole America she says those phrases you have a long history longer than a lot of us might think\nAnd they said if we let people get this kind of private wells that will be the end of the American dream\nBecause the American dream is about equality and opportunity for all not just because of the few and so they were using the American dream to hearken back to those you know found the founding principles about liberty justice opportunity for all and indeed quality and arguing the inequality would destroy those American Dream and so\nAmerican Dream was coined really to advocate for principles of social justice against free market capitalism and of course now it's\nFarm often use the other way around to argue that free market capitalism is what will enable individuals to rise but a hundred years ago there was facing exactly the same problem in fact to the extent that\nThey coins the expression the metaphor of the one percent in the Ninety nine percent because they were looking at the same inequality so they also talked about how one percent of the nation was was controlling you know vast majority of the wealth and Ninety nine percent of the country was left behind\nAnd they said in order to fight that\nKind of inequality we need to we need to figure out how to how to control capitalism so that we can protect the American dream of democracy of a quality and it's just\nNot going to serve church will all through the new book the whole America the untangle history of America First and the American dream so when does the American dream slip to me is not exactly the opposite of what you were just talking about the most ...\nPretty close that it will take the opposite side of the debate right so there there's a debate about whether whether the country is better off with um with no kind of individual private wells\nOn individual aspiration and and and eventually the argument saying the only free market totally free market capitalism would enable that kind of aspiration\nAnd prosperity and then the arguments that actually\nHe he will do better as a society if you protect collective uh quality and and protect opportunity for all until it's switch sides in the same for the debate remain fame but the American dream which pots and I'm not happened after the second World War so that happened when consumer capitalism really took off\nWhen the post war boom took off\nAnd and the idea of started to spread that um that postwar prosperity really could be had by all and that that there could be kind of you can ... that the nation could habits cake and eat it basically that you could have\nUm and and in particular that consumerism is what will deliver that an and one of the kind of moments of of where we can mark that pivot is when Harry Truman in Nineteen forty seven said that freedom of enterprise was you know kind of an ... American right and and a lot of uh\nProbably think I Know I did that the notion of freedom of enterprises afraid is much older than that but it was actually from Nineteen forty seven\nAnd ... and at that point it sort of it it helps kind of I always think of the American dream is as I said if it's if it's about a debate between kind of justice and liberty\nAnd at that point it started to kind of really ... onto the scales and in in favor of kind of liberty questions of individual liberty and individual rights to pursue what you wanted to do um and to be ... increasingly less concerned with questions of social justice and collective wellbeing\nWell let's turn to the other phrase America First this is a phrase that President Trump used ... battle Trump and his campaign and people said oh you have to go back and look up to its origins in the Nineteen thirties or Nineteen forties we're right hold on goes back further than that you talk about\nAh when America First was first used in America\nAbsolutely it is a much older crazy and I think that that\nUm those that earlier period again is instructive it it it teaches us more about what Americans have been arguing about and why I'm\nSo I'm America First the earliest traces I'd found a visitor from the Eighteen eighties actually as a Republican slogan although of course as we all know the Republican Party and the Eighteen eighties you know is is a far cry from the Republican Party day in the same goes for Democrats parties you know their identities have shifted a lot\nBut nonetheless it was Republican slogan it didn't become popularized until just a Woodrow Wilson used it in Nineteen Fifteen um and so people today talk a lot about it as a phrase that was used to keep us out of the second World War as you said you know in the thirties and I'm Nineteen forty forty one in particular\nBut actually it it became popular as a way to talk about keeping us out of the first World War so ... of the Wilson didn't use it quite in the sense that it rapidly got taken up in the name of kind of pure isolationism let in Europe solve their own problems it's not our issue um so we need to put America First\nAnd um you know and and and think about our domestic problems um and it became associated very quickly with protection is Tara\nAnd um and indeed with the debates about whether America she joined the league of nations um a lot of people were very suspicious of a lot of Americans were suspicious that the treaty of Versailles with untangle law in kind of European conflicts and put the two a day\nAnd they and they argued strenuously that we needed to put America First and not and not be kind of the foot soldiers of the European conflicts going forward and said that was\nYou know the argument that kept us out of the league of nations and then Warren Harding ran on America First in Nineteen twenty and try to pass a permanent protectionist tariff which is a little forgotten bit of history I don't really I mean he wanted to to pass out in perpetuity so that we would always have a protectionist tariff\nUm the teapot dome scandal put an end to that and then in Nineteen twenty four Calvin Coolidge who also ran on in America for slogans I mean it was incredibly\nPopular in the court if it's a it's a really prominent part of the political conversation in the twenties um and Calvin Coolidge passed a sweeping immigration or rather signed into law a sweeping immigration reform act in Nineteen twenty four called the national origins act which is a pretty matory if\nI'm In uh immigration law that that had um and I could really strict quota really ruthless quotas on the basis of people's ethnicity and the nations of origin and it's a pretty clearly you can assess law I'm trying to keep a I'm a immigrant populations I'm from northern Europe and to enter\nParts of the world on outlaw was\nDebated on the floor of Congress in the name of America First it was passed in the name of America First so the kind of on political ideas that we now associate with a with the Trump Administration has a on a much older history um I think\nAs important as that is so that the more important part is part that's the last five\nWhich is not only that America First was a very popular slogan with the ... coup Cox clan at that time and they would eat and they marched repeatedly with banners saying that they were for America first\nDate you know it's great to have you got advertisements saying that they were America's only society that was for America first and they were very explicitly in the Nineteen twenties you know they they didn't make any bones about the fact that they were white supremacist organization\nAnd will pick up on that point in just a few moments Sarah church will is with us all through the new book the whole America the entangled history of America First and the American dream you can join in at eight hundred six four to one two three four do you have questions for I guess some of the history of\nPhrases the American dream and America First and what did those means to you have you seen them change over the years when you hear America First in twenty Eighteen what
