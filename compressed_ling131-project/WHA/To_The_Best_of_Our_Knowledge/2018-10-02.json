place\nMean big changes for songwriters and music streaming sites the bill as broad support for many in the music industry including artist white Smokey Robinson who raised the changes it makes the payment of artist here used speaking before Congress in may\nIf we stopped paying people because you're selling music well that's that's ludicrous because of the fact that their time and effort and creativity into creating this music that people are getting pleasure from listening to and having for ever and ever\nEmmy winning as a reporter who covers the music and media industries are Rolling Stone Amy thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me well if I had one word to describe our music copyright system it would be complicated can you talk on the speed of yard is right now prior to this bill\nThat is extremely truth so\nThe way that music copyright works right now you can't even be explained in a sentence or a paragraph because there's so many different rules that govern different entities for instance the way that artists get paid from radio like we're listening to you right now it's completely different from the way artist get paid from a song coming through your local grocery store speaker system\nAnd the bill really does a lot to bring that together for the modern age but it still isn't you know a cure all doesn't establish one central system for artist to get paid it just helps them sort out the kinks that had been in the system for a while\nAnd one big change the system of course in recent years is a good spot to fire Pandora and are streaming radio at all these things where they kind of gray areas\nThat's exactly right they weren't necessarily gray areas for artists because artists the know how much they should be paid and they're very vocal about it but for services setting up like something like ... which is a music streaming service\nThere is really no way to get all the music at once you have to either go to every individual rights holder every label every artist and that system and say let's make a deal for your music or you can just put all of it on there and get sued so let me think meditation act helps with creating a central authority\nFor that to happen so that on the spot if I side of things there okay to just get all that music and on the artist side of things that can actually get paid who\nAll gets paid ... there's obviously the performer but they're not the only one who might get a ... or ... of a of a song who always is out there ...\nSo what do you listen to a song you might think that the money just goes to the artists and sometimes you think about the record label but in fact that's only half the equation it's the artists the record label and by the way they are also producers and co writers co authors of that song or singing maybe a chorus or hook or something\nOur contention is this anybody can challenge a book on our challenge isn't just complaining about it saying that we think that the school library or a public library book should be restricted meaning it should be harder to get to where it should be removed altogether\nAnd if it's just challenge and that happens a lot in America and that's fine it's okay for people to challenge things\nBut one book is removed a government entity\nSo we're talking about a school the republic library university is making a decision to remove that both from somebody and before we say well that's you know it's still available elsewhere [noise] many of the book so to come under challenge most frequently are kind of\nAimed at young people who are dealing with a sometimes difficult issues and so as I say if you're a teen ... you know and you're gay you don't know but the book was there if you're somebody complained\nAbout it but the school library pulled most of the libraries in America are pretty small rural areas that teenager doesn't have a credit card to go to Amazon they don't have a license to drive to the bookstore that's a town over and so what that means is these decisions to remove books have real consequences for people\nNot libraries are curated they can't have obviously all the books in the world can you talk about what happened in that process than when someone in the community said I Want to challenge this book I don't think you could carry that I don't think he should have it as part of your collection\nOkay and again I'm complaining about books is almost as much fun as reading\nAbout them so uh so that part's okay so when someone comes in there so you know this book should be restricted every move and we say okay um [noise] we have a process that we follow the librarians called request for reconsideration and what that means is set up just a knee jerk responses to what you found a bad word on pitch Seventeen\nWe sit down and look at the material selection policy that was used to go up and what we bought in the first place then usually a committee is put together that represents various different perspectives and groups and then they sit down and read the entirety of the book that's very important to\nConsider the entire service and then sit down and say how does that sort of both our policy and the new we believe that it should be retrain retain restricted or removed\nAnd the one that follows like that then they say okay we make a recommendation than to the administrator could be a library director and if someone disagrees with that then and there could be an appeal\nThat goes to a governing body so a school board or library board and after that it's final\nLet's talk about that mental op you mentioned restricted it's not an either or but but how would that work if somebody says okay we're fine with having this in the library we don't want it as accessible to kids under age I don't know wild\nWell my story but that one goes back to when I was a kid and I was I was fourteen years old and I had just for the first time and I went to look up some of the stuff and so I being a good library user and went to the card catalogue and looked up the word sex and there really was a headache and my public library this said for sex see librarian\nAnd what I loved about that you know that's ... could have been a potentially very popular service but in fact\nI'm looking for this book but of course he's very nervous when you do something like that and then there was a special location somewhere in the back room or under the desk or somewhere a kitten [noise] well what we've learned is librarian said special collections\nAre basically collections nobody asks for them and nobody used them it's like buying the book and putting it on box doesn't\nDoesn't serve a purpose\nThat a parent might say okay I don't want my ... my fourteen year old great my five year old they're maybe not ready I I think as a parent for some of the material how do you are display it so that maybe that fourteen year old can get to a five year old doesn't stumble out onto it\n[noise] well libraries have always had\nSections within the building that kind of are targeted to specific ages so if you're a you know a preschooler or somewhere between the ages of three and seven or eight you're hanging out in the juvenile picture book area and easier eaters\nIt's not I'm the same location within the library and I think that uh the other thing that we should remember is that first I don't think that children can read too much I really don't and I also think that um if you're five years old you're not interested in the things that a fourteen year old is is interested in and not going to pick up the book and read\nTalking to Jamie ... director of the American library association office for intellectual freedom it's a banned book weak and Jamie let's get into some of the most commonly challenged the books of of last year the most recent twenty Seventeen a one that's come up I I assume because of the I think with the Netflix series\nThirteen reasons why by Jay editor and you talk about that\nBook yeah sure come when it first came out in two thousand seven and I should say the topic of the book is suicide\nIn high school so it main character commit suicide and the rest of the book kind of goes through so why did she do that to know all the people who were involved in that decision so when it came out in two thousand Seventeen a lot of school administrators and superintendents and principals\nPulled the book before anybody even ask for it and that's because there is a justifiable concern\nUm sometimes we have a suicides in schools and they become almost contagious and so the administrators are very worried about that\nBut then librarians who set up and they said well the reason we bought the ... because there are children who are dealing with us we have people in our high school and at least gives us the way to say that you're not alone and we can talk about it and their resources that we can make available to well when the um [noise]\nNetflix series came out the book again was traveling for such a big a surge in the challenge is to it [noise] even though the book and the Netflix series of very different in the book the girl who kills herself does it by taking sleeping\nPills and in a serious it's more graphic there is um a razor blade involved\nAnd so once again we find that in those places where there was no librarian the worried a superintendent or principal came in and remove the book and didn't say and no one said anything it just disappeared but where there were school librarians they said\nWe bought this for a reason there is a process that we have to follow before it's removed and in many cases what they do is invest and things like Web sites on the school [noise] um catalogue to say if you are thinking about this these are resources and so of course librarians feel that a a weird defenders of the right to inquire\nAnd be rather than just silence people who are saying things we don't want to hear we think the more speeches better than less speech silence\nThere's nobody and sometimes speaking can save a life\nA couple of other books on the challenge west I Am jazz by Jessica hurtful and jazz a jazz Jennings I'm Sorry and George by Alex Gino both deal with gender identity can you talk about why these are constantly challenged\nIn fact fifty percent of the books that were challenged in two thousand Seventeen fall into elegy beauty you know one of the things I often believes that when we roll off this list every year in ...\nOrder to us [laughter] it's kind of a snapshot of what mainstream America is worried about this year and so algae beauty has been in the news quite a lot and so the fairly small smattering of books that have been done to be published and show up in libraries are getting some significant pushback\nAnother one Andy Thomas has gotten a lot of attention lately the heat you get a ... a different category I think I deal with racial issues\n[noise] yeah this was one in fact I Believe in movies is coming out about it and it's about a young black girl who\nSees a friend of hers get shot by the police and so she works through um [noise] and I think a very interesting way to say this is the experience from the police side of it from the high school side of it from the white side of it from the black side of it and it's a powerful and moving story\nAnd a couple of recurring title does seem to come up year after year I'll throw out a few of them not to kill a mocking bird the Kite Runner and absolutely true diary of a part time Indian why do some books like that that come up again and again with challenges over the years\nYou know sometimes a blue for the best definition we have the classic of something that irritates one generation after another and by that I mean it says something powerful and significant excess uncomfortable\nAnd so like we absolutely true diary of a part time Indian talks about the real difficulties faced by Native Americans growing up in a culture that I'm as almost destroyed theirs the Kite Runner talks about the very difficult issue of uh [noise]\nYou know a conflict between cultures and uh and sexual violence and its effect on young people\n[noise] so it's a killer Rob mocking bird deals with race which is something that America continues to grapple with so I think that um it's not surprising\nFor the book could wind up being banned are also on the cult classic left\nOur library programs sometimes challenged department of materials themselves\n[noise] yeah we're actually starting to see quite a shift in the landscape of libraries that used to be his books and now it's a displays and ironically off from the displays that are challenged are banned books week displays\nOr someone will come in and say you know that book there that's really offensive I understand that you have to have it but just don't show it to anybody [noise] or we have challenges that are done to speakers not even necessarily library programs but\nSomeone in the community might say I want to do a program that has to do with um [noise] um you know the connection between autism and vaccinations and so someone will push back and say well the libraries permit that to happen [noise] so um we live in an increase in less than ... times I Believe\nWe both are with a message to uh people who use their libraries around the country why banned book week is important\n[noise] let's remember that the first amendment is all about our individual right to inquire is our rights to learn as we look around the world and say what are all the problems that we face reading too much isn't one of them\nMore kids read the more prepared they're going to be for life and the more the kids and adults talk about those books together to better understand each other\nThese Homs will grow exponentially as temperatures rise there are also some dangerous feedback loops that start to kick in at higher temperatures we'll see run away ice sheets last which will contribute to really catastrophic sea level rise\nOr we could see changes in Pomona frost melting a ocean acidification which can really affect a are of fish and ecosystems in the ocean so these are the kinds of impacts that we want to do our best to avoid and we still have a chance of limiting some of these worst and bugs\nAre going to Rachel who just from the universe a union excuse me of Concerned Scientists talk about climate change\nA report out from the Trump Administration are predicts a seven degree increase that's Fahrenheit by the end of the century a bunch says a particular policy change your economy standards increases more strict standards wouldn't make a big enough different\nAnd reach was returned to policies would start with this one what kind of impact and fuel economy standards have on greenhouse gas emissions\nWell fuel economy standards are a critical to lowering the emissions from what is now the largest source of a heat trapping emissions in the U.S so it's it's a really important factor of the economy that we have to uh try to limit emissions from and diesel very sensible\nStandards uh that had been agreed to\nThese standards that though the industry and uh environmental groups supported they were ... not just going to help limit emissions from the sexual but we're also going to create a generation of cars that that would be safer\nOr more of fuel efficient that would uh pay consumers back in their pocket both in terms of saving\nFuel cost so there are lots of good reasons to implement these standards and that sort of us should be seen for what it is it is a cynical ploy to prop up fossil fuel ... this is not serving the interests of the American public um do you use a vehicle efficiency standards were\nWidely accepted appreciate it they were going into effect and now just like across the board a cross climate policy\nThis administration is turning back the clock whether it's a power plant carbon standards vehicle efficiency standards or standards to limit me saying emissions which are also a highly both ... and a heat trapping gas from the oil and gas industry\nThen that's been another big change from the Obama administration to the Trump Administration can you talk about what's changed in the last couple of years\nOh what has changed unfortunately is that I also feel interests have uh given marching orders are to the administration the administration has pointed at the very highest levels of agencies like the EPA folks\nWho really are doing the bidding of these folks fulfill interests they are not looking out for the mission of the agency which is to protect\nPublic health and wellbeing that is what the ... nation is and climate changes posing sex significant a I'm a problems to our economy not just a ... dollar tones that harm to people\nAh that it's it's really an abdication of the agencies\nDuty to the American public to see it rolled back a standard up to standard\nUh these protective standards deliver not just a cut and heat trapping emissions they also deliver a lot of public health benefits of from brick juicing hopefully like mercury I'm a nice ... nitrogen oxide so for all sides of particulate\nMatter all of which caused a huge public health board to Americans\nSo we're seeing them rolled back every national climate and clean energy policy uh we have a and that is really a very sad a very dangerous um set of actions\nA big argument from the Trump Administration and others is that some of these climate change related regulations or were hurting the economy or would hurt the economy or whether it's sided terms of more expensive cars more expensive energy or what do you say to those concerns\nThese are completely store is argument there there is such a you know they're they're they're the opposite of what is actually happening so if you look at the power sector for example what we're seeing in the marketplace is that Keno forms of energy and like solar wind\nOr even natural gas a winning out against a cold they're winning out in the marketplace because they're they're cheaper um they're cleaner they're more desirable people a a a really embracing utilities and consumers are embracing these new forms of energy\nTo in a desperate attempt to prop up coal ah they're now trying to float these ideas of bailouts or a old a coal plants I'm this is just you know it's so blatantly ah against what would help us in terms of moving towards that clean energy economy\nSo it's really important to recognize that uh that ... the options they're taking a across the board and the rationale for them is still sends the this is not about the economy because the economy is thriving even as we're moving to these Keno forms of energy\nFor talking to Rachel creators right now policy director for the climate and energy program for the union of Concerned Scientists she's with us to talk about a recent report from the Trump
