R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nEvery family has\nI grew up listening to ... I mean there are stories of exercises and those of us are coincidences of just truly uncanny things that happen\nI don't know if I Believe and goes but um that's the story of\nThe ghost of William just suppress\nThis is your app march and she's talking about her father and\nFather died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three it's about her father's ghosts and how he appeared in the house to grow up in Michigan\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my mother went to assisted living and then we sold it [noise]\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety no I'm Sorry I Would have been Nineteen Ninety five\nI took a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house remodeled it\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's coast has been here and I looked at her like she was a little [noise]\nWacko [noise] Mm [noise]\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house\nAnd this vision or a man or a figure appeared and she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there's some man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\nLater her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever there isn't a feared\nRunning down stairs to say he's back and found out her husband had electrocuted himself\nAnd she ran upstairs called nine eleven and they came and treated her husband or whatever they do [noise]\nI feel that dad safety and\nSo when I got back to Michigan\nI found a picture of my father and his thirties a pitcher my father in the sixties and I sent those pictures to her and she wrote back and she said\nMy coast is your father [noise]\nSo I Would say that you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah I mean I've heard Wilder stories oh yeah I mean there are stories of ... after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was a ghost town and my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff that year the family straight arrow I've been around a lot of true believers and I am not one and it's probably not an accent that I became a journalist and yet this stuff the uncanny the paranormal\nYou read about this stuff all the time why\nThere are some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real without throwing your intellect out the window your rationality out the window\nWhere do you make of that store without just saying oh that's impossible you know there's just there's no way one of the most interesting people I talked to\nWas Michael Schober the poster boy of skepticism you know it was Michael shear where he is a scientist an atheist\nA regular columnist for Scientific American he has the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and he's the guy you go to if you want to have someone throw cold water on these crazy turn almost stories the strange thing is he has his own story\nWell so my wife's from a clone Germany she was raised by a single mom and a grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so\n[noise]\nThey used to listen to music you meet her and when he\nDied she kept it and stop working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway when she we met and bell in love and so and she moved to\nLos Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio and I try to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slap that on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and I\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know in the day of our wedding\nJust at a particular moment when she was feeling rather sad that there was nobody there from her family and\nFriends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house it was it was like what was that you know and I thought well I'm is left my iPhone on my laptop with dunes or maybe the next door neighbors play music and it was none of that and then we\nOpen the door beneath the fax machine and there's the rate that plane is blamed Islam perfectly you know perfectly to the station [noise] for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean it meant something\nTo her her symbolically anyway like the grandfather was there with us today every wedding to make her feel good and it did [noise]\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and\nI get it to work and and civil war is still there [noise]\nTo just share my I think that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence\nOr not really but\nIt kind of ... [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... column down because it is okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit but but that also is insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this and I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of ... of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this and Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen\nYou know my friend is not real religious friends with people like the buck to Oprah that think that there's a you know sort of a quantum field that inner connects all of this in a quantum consciousness way he thinks that it's a sign you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife said numerous experiences and last year and a half where she felt sad or\nWas missing home and the radio didn't come on a kind of it\nBut this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable there there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat's possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting at the experience again and those kind of one off events don't fit that\nAnd it could be they are real and we just are limited and how we can study them\n[noise]\nWell I don't think that science can ask the question of what ultimately tree about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is\nBeyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Tanya learning [noise] signed the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties and\nYou know I haven't told anybody that's but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner of the room looking down on my body [noise]\nPeople see things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things that other people couldn't tear they sometimes feel their mind leaving their body and we see around\nMe these experiences happen to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has spent her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and when she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the ... community practitioners of magic and she joined in\nSo as not politicians do you do what the field that you've come to study does no I meant I cast spells on his part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot of that law\nAnd participated in these different groups as they met to\nCarry out their ritual magic did it become real for you or at least at times one of the things I could see\nConscious channel I take dictation from guides that worked for a million actually dictate entire books through me that require no editing so I'm primarily known as a conscious channel and I also work as an ... path which is\nA psychic ability I have this article ready to step in to other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio because that's the way to look at me and who argue channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that there are teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness and we're at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere is a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage and history but I mean so that now that you can distinguish between different gods they have a different personality collective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like\nThe one that I've seen that I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and I was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down and he was you know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hats\nAnd it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat out the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the weathering was raised and it was higher clip ethics and I didn't know what any of it meant to time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nRoebuck some time and so when you when you have that image I mean you do take that literally do you think this is what this guide really I think that's how he presented himself for me so\nThis all sounds kind of crazy yeah Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might have felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of a religious you know and not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient [noise]\n... I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year at a graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that ... what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like\nA fog comes in and rounds out all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain it and I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy\nMoving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I started seeing lights around people or maybe not as a result of that but ... after I sort of seeing this things is flashes started going off so when you say see lights around people without was whether they look like wells fireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head\nSo I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\n[laughter] I'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical she or he might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was and why you for twenty five year teaching creative writing my writing yeah I play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this but once the first book came out I had to begin to own a bit more and that was a challenge so you're not you're not teaching creative writing and he no I'm not ...\nI'm traveling around the world [noise] sitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them and then all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with their dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work but if you're actually having problems in your relationship\nAnd you give me your spouse his name I can step into your spouse speaking to look like her and possibly hear what's going on in the dynamic and that's been proven out in the film one on channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through and then being receptive to take the dictation\nThat it's a play that out for America explain that for me if you can when you say you're like a radio you know you got to sort of tune into the writing channel and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you ... how does that work I mean ... where are you in where whereas pulse L like Dr ... heated\nI'm president but I'm receded I use ...\nOh like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt pertinent and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of the session\nSites they really are you are and you're not going at you know sort of cleaning up the only way you're saying these books either they're not written by you it's air like Richard Pryor automatic writing any no no no they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed\nDo you think about the metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here I\nDo and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who ask those questions okay while you're sitting with one right now these are not going to access it myself because I actually don't know\nAnd I would have to recede and begin traveling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off this conversation so far out to begin with the money is the lesson that I I ... through [laughter]\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group in my part but the met for Eighteen years\nWith about ten people who would show but the most every week and we would sit in a circle with guides would talk and they would bring this energy through and we all feel it\nWhat are the guides say you know you've written you know multiple bucks an hour they have through new mayor or is there sort of a common message\n[noise] yeah I think that who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talk about humanity being at a at a transitional points that's evolution right now and the the opportunity really is here for us to reclaim what would they would say is I think are true identity\nAnd how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success what beauty is all of these things that we collectively ascribed\nGreat value to is really inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of one cell and all of the ones creations and what's been created in fear and needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic if that's different you're not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are I think\nIt's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that and I was very frightening person ... much of my life afraid of what life things life yeah life\nYou know I was a sensitive kid you know when I grew up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am\nYou know there's a quote from Helen Shukman the woman who was the channel for a course in miracles [noise] she said I don't believe it but I Know it's true\nAnd I can get behind that I understand that I don't believe it either but I Know it's true we mean you don't believe that you must believe it I Believe I don't I Know that it's happening I don't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do\nI'm I'm very happy to be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul salad he's published five channel taxed Steve we started earlier talking about your family and all the stories of family goes to the paranormal has doing all these interviews changed how you feel about your family's experiences and stories\nYeah it has it has um [noise]\nWe have really good countries [laughter] when the family gets together because you know we have these mutual interest and we'd come at it very differently and uh [noise] I'm a speaker", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "01"}
