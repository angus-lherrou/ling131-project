listeners who support this NPR station\nIt's to the best of our knowledge\nYou ever go to a museum art gallery and wonder how on earth and I just came up with that\nI started playing the shape of probably about twelve or Thirteen Years ago\nThis is Randy Johnson he's a rising star in contemporary art\nSitting in my bathroom listening to show on National Public radio\nWas a the ... show I mean come on and to be a long term thing in my bathroom in the same type of snow show on shave letter I got a call from the friends he asked me what I was doing sitting in the past of listening to public radio putting on shave I didn't say\nInteresting work okay that wouldn't see my reaction but we're talking about how artists work [noise]\nThey kind of let me thinking about how complicated material was its relationship to Africa and an African ness from lifetime and crash it better it is it's a West African and say oh this\nOften put in a lot of different products that we use today\nEven dragons indifference lotions pretty much everybody has put shape better on their skin and they just may not realize it everybody is using shave butter and they may not realize so they are all in the gauging and some sort of relationship with the fact that there may not necessarily be aware that they\nWere standing in front of one of Russia's John for his newest works in a one man show at the Milwaukee art museum it's a long heavy wooden table piled with big sculptural blocks of shape butter and when you get close you can see that the table itself has been burned\nAnd places looks almost like a rich or\nIt is kind of a ritual experience I built the large forged and then I have the steel brands some of them are kind of like gun sights others are just circles trying old but the steel brands go into the into the four and a heated almost like a cattle brand\nAnd then it burns as to the table so there's a scarring or the scarf vacation in the material and by placing the shape butter on top of it and you kind of imagine beginning the healing process for this crash and\nSo what began as a private moment in a bath tub turned into a peaceful of historical allusions to slavery of colonial trade\nThis is what fascinates me about rushing Johnson he's always thinking about the complicated relationship push and pull between individual and collective identity\nThe biggest piece here is actually a bond or a room and forest sides of open black scaffolding spilling on her tropical plants and pork and bugs [laughter]\nLike we're looking at a gigantic bookcase [laughter] but then with all this lush green [noise]\nAnd the plants all from different places so you haven't recovered cactus you have all these you have all these different plans from different places kind of living together in a way I think it's almost a metaphor for the collective loss in some ways\nSarcastic and getting\nThe kind of climate and and then they have to kind of force their body up until the middle of the space so it's kind of a trying experience but I think it's more rewarding when are you going to have you gone in there yourself I spent quite a bit of time inside of the sculpture\nBut it it is affords me a certain insight into it knowing it was looking at it from a distance being in Nigeria haven't grown up in Nigeria illuminates my understanding of American even though I'm an American\nI Want to pick up a little bit on your own personal history your your background because it's it's obviously informed or you're writing\nYou were born in in the U. S. right in Michigan if but then quickly your family move it in a few months to like us and you grow up there for how long how many ... Seventeen years yeah and then came back to America and then I came back to\nThe U.S back to the mid west back to Kalamazoo for university we had no money very little but I came to the u._s. I got some scholarships I got some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American who was a Nigerian it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was black did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black\nI mean the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the u._s.\nSo when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time started having those ...\nI you know I've been in the U.S for\nA twenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's inevitable but you know within those first couple of years\nThere are many things I did not have a narrative for what does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan in a car slows down the window is one down and someone shouts the N. word at me\nI had to figure out what to think about that\nBut also what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting and somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks\nWhat does that mean you know and all of this stuff has to be understood and you know\nIt took time but my experience of life is as a black person in America you live in Brooklyn now I live in Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so and did you consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home\nBecause that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends of air my\nBooks there so that's how I consider legos home\nMy parents live there it's where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos\nLanguages I'm fluent in so there's an at home this but home is also wherever there's Good Wife by\n[laughter] that sounds [laughter] that connects me to the world in a way that is to reduce the ball and as essential to my experience of the world do you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature is a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger allowed\nI'm American and um America is in crisis at the moment I feel invested in being an American who with other Americans thinks about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of\nBeing invested in what do we owe each other what do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater of war that's my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very nature and in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time in our like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities well the commonality of\nVery similar uh it is the experience of called ... which is maybe the fourth definition of home for me [laughter] you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumptions about\nVince conversations I've been talking about mhm if somebody says you know\nEngage should be and or Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how is somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person able to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that sort of the core value of cosmopolitan and some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us in New York New York is much richer\n... might have twenty five buildings of monumental scale and New York has three hundred never ceases to surprise me that the sheer physical scale of New York and then there's that\nThing in New York of being a will capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't lead people in Cairo Johannesburg tell you\nDifferent life than they are dogs this is a very strong guy talk yeah later as the late ...\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and sold Lagos is the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that New York is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what is it will look like if these borders are not\nAs they are right now I've loved and actually whiz with a passage from from your book open city\nWhich is set in New York kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering and which is sort of I think gets at some of the things that we've been talking about the jury that yes thank you for a bunch of his book of wandering and what I really\nWanted to evoke over the course of this book was psychological intensity but also a sense of plenty [noise]\nFirst I encountered the streets of incessant loud [noise]\nShock after the days focus and ...\nWhat I've shutters calm all of sudden private chapel the Blair Witch TV set [noise]\nI Will my waist crowds of shoppers and workers too little construction was [noise]\nWalking so busy parts of town that I laid eyes on more people\nWhen I was a customs the course of the things\nNeighborhood city it should be made up of different substance seemed to have a different [noise]\nDifferent psychic weight [noise] bright lights and Trump's housing project and luxury hotel [noise]\nThe fire escape some city parks [noise]\nFutile topical sorting went on until the phones begets morph into each other\nAnd assume obstruct trade [noise]\nUnrelated to the city [noise]\nIn my mind financial somebody and still felt [noise]\nDead you cold talking with Steve Coll some ... new book is called blind spot and you can see some of the photographs in it on our website take people's dot org where you'll also find a link to a much longer interview Steve did with him in the millions [noise] so we're\nTalking this hour about reinventing yourself getting outside boxes or writers have a word for those\nBoxes genres [noise]\nHere's Lauren ... with a dangerous idea [noise]\n... the author of broken monsters and my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether I Am so tired of the very artificial arguments that their literature and they're in science fiction and that there is\nWesterns and crime novels and they that these are all somehow different and have different values systems as far as I'm concerned we should be ... you know reading habits we should take any Dan Book we liked to bed as long as that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your ear and the boss but you know\nSo the idea that we have stories and we have good stories of bad stories and we have stories that use different elements but to reduce them into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeonholed where they have to set certain criteria it's so frustrating and tedious [noise]\nI think we miss out on a lot of really good books and of course the bad psi phi but it also depends on what your idea of science fiction is it's a very broad church it's the same with crime you might have\nAlready tedious it'll murder mystery which breaks out all the cliches about pretty dead girls and a serial killer creeping up on people and we've seen it before and then you might read a crime novel like on girl which just blows you out of the water\nThese distinctions they're fake they don't exist when he'd mull hybrid novels we need novels which can take their inspiration from the world read what you want to read make yourself happy re challenging adventurous dangerous books across different genres surprised yourself [noise]\nI was trying to sleep and you know my parents were you know jamming and um I heard this guy you know as I playing piano is just like us so aggravated trying to see if I was probably about six hundred just wanted to go to school the next day and I\nAnd I've run out there and there's this guy and he's in red spandex and I'm white Mickey Mouse sweatshirt and huge afro and he just hanging on the piano and I'm like\n...\nAnd it was last\n[laughter] so do\nYou know had I known your later I'd be idolizing has sunk mastery [laughter]\nInteresting what who you're talking about I've read so much about your past growing up I was thinking about your biography and you're talking about people you're around people that I figure special is delayed prince who I Know you were ... and and he was your mentor told me about ... about your relationship with him and the music but you really do with him [noise] yeah\nWell that was just an awesome surprises life [laughter] um I you know growing up a huge huge prince fan and he reached out to me on line like Nico will you come to the park and play with us to say yes to that one [laughter] it's pretty much a you know so we went to Paisley you know that's where the egg was\nAnd um yeah I don't know if I meet him I didn't know if he'd be like the wizard of Oz like behind the curtain you know whatever we were sound checking and you know we're in the Paley Park and all of his outfits that you ever remember from ever video where we're we're hanging there and I I can I say the F. word\nSo we were told not to swear but anyhow that's obviously really hard for me so I looked up and I'm like oh shit like that and I and I my eyes go down from looking at the ceiling and don't Barry is like oh gosh\nSo I just kept sanction and it was so bad um and then he was like have you ever been to Paisley before and I said no no he's like you want to come check it out oh yeah [laughter] so um I was asking him all kinds of questions and he and he is a super cool and very generous\nAnd then over the years you know we just became friends and he would bring me out on the road and um we wrote together and jammed together and watch movies and he was just very generous with advice and support and\nYeah can you please for me I just I'm sure the song is going to become a hit I I Would assume it will I ever want to play the Fort loves it when you do your your cover of princes nothing compares to you for us because it\nThank you [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] hit\n[noise] since you feel as though he
