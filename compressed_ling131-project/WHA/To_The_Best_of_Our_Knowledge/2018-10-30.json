Republican businessmen Jay Schrader he's running for secretary of state challenging democratic incumbent Doug La Follette ... thanks a lot for joining us today Thanks for having me well we've been asking for a candidate to give a short pitch for why voters should elect them why should you be the next secretary of state of Wisconsin\n'cause I have an interest in the office of initially to get a to be on the ballot you need to have two thousand signatures and when I talk to people I've had Democrats independents and Republicans sign my nomination papers and the overwhelming thing that they want to just to have term limits on this position\nCurrent officeholders held office for forty years and overall in all parties or a people that signed my papers they want that as my number one goal there was talk\nAbout getting rid of the officer the secretary of state a lot of its responsibilities have been moved to other parts of the state government uh what are your thoughts on the existence of this job\nWhile the that was for the state treasurer but these are constitutional officers I'm supposed to be a public servant to the people have spoken and said we want to put these officers to work\nUh I Want to do that or the number one goal after term limits as to uh work on eliminating voter fraud in the state of Wisconsin 'cause then according to ... to ... there was four thousand cases in two thousand and sixteen election\nSo how would you use the role of secretary of state which currently doesn't really do anything with elections how do you see yourself using that roll out when it comes to\nA voting while the in the United states of America the overwhelming majority of secretary of states are involved in an election so I use that as a\nPrecursor to talking to the legislature and governor to say okay the majority of the states have that let's have that in Wisconsin gimme statutory authority or even a in a dish and sit on the election commission it's going to be a full time job doing that and then what's important about that is when you have a fraud vote that negates your ... your or my vote\nAnd that's why we need to make sure they're all\nUm legitimate\nBut some of the former responsibility the office that have been removed from its mandate include a licensing of corporations notary services the authority to publish bills signed into law or the list goes on would you want to see some of those jobs restored to the office of secretary\nOf state well those duties ah it's been a taken away from the current off a solar Mr ... by ... bipartisan I Believe\nI never

Semitism Jews or the most warmly regarded\nSafe group in the United states yet we saw some increases in hate crime one other thing we've seen an increase in anti Semitic content on the darkest corners of the Web and do Thompson did some great research on four chance which we've been fortunate to to use\n'em so it depends on what you're looking at but the bottom line is I think we have several things and just bear with me which specific regard\nTo the anti Semitism oh in the past Fifteen Years we had the decline\nIn confidence in the communal institutions which held us together and this kind of anti elitism wave which is coming in at the same time we see breathtaking demographic changes the United states white Christians are no longer a majority\nAnd then we have a\nIn addition to these catalytic events of of which I spoke and the emergence of white nationalism one last thing\nI Am not calling the president a racist or anything like that I Will leave others to analyze that but here's what I Do know is happened for the first time in decades white nationalists have found someone that they believe is speaking their message\nAnd we've seen increased activity by these people whether it's public demonstrations which of them have been floated a little bit post Charlottesville but we've seen a fragment issue these hate groups so that hornet's nest is broken\nBut these lone wolf hornets are flying around and they're directed by this horrible bigotry that can be found increasingly in our civil political discourse\nTo Brian Levin from the center for a study of hate and extremism at California State University San Bernardino about a recent act of political violence\nBrian talk more about the Internet we hear a talk of people being radicalized by ISIS on the Internet when it comes to extremist a domestic violence and that's it\nSee an analogy that [noise]\nI I really do it the only thing I Would say is one of the things that everyone has to understand about extremism here most likely to have an extremist\nAsked who lives kind of where you live so I asked Gary live free who's head of the uh University of Maryland a terrorism quote the global terrorism database I have some things that you notice and when he told me he said\nPeople are acting in your region where they live so so that's something and I think what we've seen with the Internet just like with our socio political\nHas been a change\nAnd that is this fragmentation so not only has the organization of these hate groups change where where they are becoming a leaner and meaner and sometimes a really more lawyers who are less of hate groups the followers up their messes and as we have this fragmentation do risk increase relief from\nThese ... loners or or or small groups that are increasingly violent we've seen an escalation of violence in recent weeks that that's a very dangerous conundrum and it's very similar to what we've seen with for instance dice\nWhen al Qaeda wouldn't wouldn't bin Laden was killed\nHe was upset that these kind of like a low owners who are inspired\nBut not trained for taking it taking the help and I think we're kind of seen that here in the United states with regard to the most that\nForm of extremism right now which is far right way but we're seeing a rising tide is lifting many ships but the most the standard is the far right wing and the loners yours or small town in the cells with in those groups\nAre ones we we have to look at it as well\nTalking to Brian Levin right now a professor of criminal justice and director of the center for
