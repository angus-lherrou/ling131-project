have gotten edited fully expanded the Medicaid program\nAnd with healthcare continuing to dominate the mid term elections this year the governor's democratic critics are saying we should reconsider our approach to the Affordable CARE Act guy Bolden covers health policy in the business of health care for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel guy thanks for joining us\nThank you for having me will remind us how Wisconsin was different we're kind of unique and how we handle the Medicaid expansion and that's federal money\nYes um Wisconsin has taken an approach unlike any other state in the country towards the Affordable CARE Act and to expanding coverage for Wisconsin did was\nExpand eligibility for Medicaid while not accepting the additional federal dollars that were available through the Affordable CARE Act now the thing is that the state did\nThat's different is is\nUnder the AC a\nIf the state had expanded eligibility for the Medicaid program to a hundred and thirty eight percent of the federal poverty level it would have reached this the federal government would have paid\nInitially a hundred percent of the cost of covering the people getting coverage it eventually drops down to Ninety percent by twenty twenty\nSo say to make it simple let's say the fed would pay Ninety percent the state did not take that money what the state did is expanded eligibility for adults without dependent children\nWith incomes below a hundred percent of the federal poverty level which this year is about twelve thousand dollars\nBy not take the fed is still subsidizing their coverage because Medicaid is a federal and state program\nThe federal government pays about fifty nine percent of the cost of our Medicaid program or programs because Medicaid really it was a collection of programs um so what it means is that the feds are paying\nFifty nine percent of the cost of covering these folks if we had expanded eligibility up to a hundred and thirty eight percent of the federal poverty level\nUm we would have gotten this enhanced match and the feds would pay Ninety percent of the cost\nAnd you tally in this piece oh what a what that cost the state and in fact what federal money didn't slow into the state talk about how you figured that out and what it came up to\nLike this film so many memories or you're covering a rude and watching this movie and there's a Mother's Day

through twenty eight central time executive producer Judas years foresaw talk to cap the main reason ... executive director of the ideal breeders of the usa\nKathy what is the history of the Clydesdale breed\nThe history of the ... failed breed ... breed is I have a draft horse it's I'm part of the draft horse world\nUm they had um evolved in Scotland actually\nUm during the nineteenth century and they were powerful horse with a sizable who've and and perfect build for the scat Scottish farmland and the coal fields and land a chair and for all kinds of heavy hauling\nAnd um they branched out into other countries Australia New Zealand Canada and the United states\nAnd what is the history been here in the U.S\nThe clay failed breeders of the United states\nUm they have been they were incorporated in Eighteen Seventy nine and had been working on promoting the Clydesdale breathe through pure bred registry publications shows you know public promotion um and so the ... breeders has been working long time\nHorse evolve so you said in Scotland they were really well suited for an agricultural work their own word they use for that also in North America\nYes they were they were and then as everything evolves you know we got the tractors and we got equipment that would take over that were some people still use them as a workhorse um but they've become more of a\nYou know a pure bred that is um to breed to show and to 'em for enjoyment more than actual work because of all the tractors and industry\nWell and I have to say ever since I knew that I was going to be talking with you about this I had kind of a nonstop soundtrack in my head of that Budweiser commercials and the the beautiful footage of you know these these huge but such so elegant horses you know prancing in front of the the Budweiser\nBeer wagon word they used a here in Wisconsin certainly we have a huge beer history were they associated with the beer industry\nAbsolutely Anheuser Busch has really done there are breed proud um they have promoted the Clydesdale horse and its majestic qualities to AT T um they have become national icons of the ... you know the Budweiser clients deals are respected and\nUm by everyone so they have really pushed the breed out there and they have promoted the beauty of the breed you know the um personality and agility of the breed they've really helped with pope public awareness and made the ... breed one of the most favorite draft horses\nWill tell us about the breed the horse in some cells what kind of temperament for instance do they have\nWell the Clydesdale breed is known as a gentle giants um that\nKind of a a like a slang word that we use but it is true um these big horses are very gentle they're very smart and very trainable they're very eager to please um and they are A People's horse I mean not only being beautiful there just a pleasure to be around\nThere are so big are they able to be written\nYes writing has really evolved in the last decade and at our world quite feel show we have really gone into that versatility of the breed that's kind of what we're promoting in our industry now because we all see I'm In ... you know pulling the Budweiser wagon\nWe seem heirs and falls in the past year and there's nothing more beautiful than that but they also are very trainable and very they're good athletes so we have evolved in\nWriting western English dressage will have a jumping class\nBarrel racing um there's nothing that a Clydesdale really can't do\nWow because yeah I'm an animal that size but it's a ... you might think that they would be less that Joe Biden sounds like that's not the case how much bigger are they than an average I don't even know what an average horses much but they certainly are one of the bigger breeds aren't they\nThey are um the draft horses are all bigger breeds um there's different breeds within the draft horse industry\nBut I'm a Clydesdale horse can get all the way up to Eighteen plus hands and they can weigh up to a time when they're all ventured out so that's over two thousand\nHad is that it mhm wow they'd we laugh we said you know that can they can wait as much as a Volkswagen Beetle power you know but so they're very very big which makes their\nAgility the same as the light horse but like the barrel racing won't go as fast because there's so much bigger but\nThe the agility and the building\nThere we're talking with Kathy ... she's executive director of the Clydesdale breeders of the United states and we're talking about the twenty Eighteen world Clydesdale show which is happening in Madison October twenty fifth to the twenty eighth and one of the really um\nCharacteristic things about Clydesdale or those huge ... how did those developer is that common with draft horses\nThat bag hooves all the draft fried have a big who've they are big animals and for the work that they do they have to have a big spoof to support their weight and to pull and so if you think about a draft horse\nThere who've who's going to be about as big as your dinner plate ... they have to have that underneath them to support their body and to do what they do they have to have that good big foot on them\nHow did you get involved with Clydesdale Kathy\n[laughter] my family we're a fourth generation family here in northern Illinois my parents' rented a farm years ago and the landlord happened to have quite so horses here the U.S we have evolved from that um we get involved in that and um\nWe tease if you've ever been bitten by the quite the bug it's something that you don't ever get over once you you know get involved with the breed you just\nIt's a necessity in life kind of so that's how we got involved and we're going on the fourth generation now here on our farm raising the Clydesdale horses\nI saw that six hundred Clydesdale from around the world will be at the world Clydesdale shows how do you transport a horse that big\nYes we had um actually six hundred and fifty quite feel horses\nAnd um we call it a world shows so that the horses usually come by semi truck or trucking trailer\nSome people have so far journey they will go so far in a day and then they'll lay over it up what they call a horse hotel so the horses can rest and get their nourishment they need and then back in the trailer so I'm to the United states and Canada they use semi trucks or you know the trailer just a horse trailer\nAnd um\nSometimes when you export from overseas we like to know that we're international partners on keeping this breed going so most of the time if you bring a horse from another country it's by air freight\nSo they literally are getting onto a plane\nYes yes they do um we have some horses from other countries here that had been purchased and acts and imported into the United states prior so they're already here we had a couple of horses and one from South Africa that was supposed to join us but the protocol\nOn the blood work is so stringent that um that horse got hung up and quarantine but we have many many people from all over the world coming to this event\nAnd can't be as we wrap up if people come to the world Clydesdale show in Madison what will they see\nWell the full schedule is on our website for the world Clydesdale show dot com but they are going to see a flavor of the versatility as a Clydesdale horse you're you will see horses shown and Halter just another lead classes you will see all the writing the jumping barrel racing dressage\nYou will see hitch is from the single cart up to eight horse Hedges\nOn the the edges here you've got progressive activists devoted conservatives on the opposite end but then you've got your digital conservatives in traditional liberals but they aren't really a mirror image of each other they kind of function differently those traditional conservatives you find are in many ways more engaged they're not as frustrated at the traditional liberals what's going on\n[noise] the traditional liberals and the conservatives have do have something in common and that's that they are more or less of the same generation these tend to be of the baby boomer generation a little bit older and they also tend to think of themselves as Americans they have pride in Being American especially on the conservative side\nBut where they differ is in their emotions towards the country today traditional conservatives is Nineteen percent of the population these are people who are will describe themselves as Republicans um they're primarily supportive of Trump and so this isn't a moment where they feel only frustration at the United states\nThey also feel like their voices are being heard they feel as if the country is moving in a positive direction in many ways and so they're not as frustrated and fatigue by this political moment as the traditional liberals are who feel very much that the country's headed in the wrong direction\nAnd I think if we had done this study for instance in twenty two thousand nine or two thousand and ten in the heyday of\nThe Tea Party in the early years of the Obama presidency we would have defined as exhausted majority group a little differently and we I think the traditional liberals would have been more and the positive side and the traditional conservatives would've made up part of this exhausted frustrated majority talking to Steven\nHawkins from the group more in common about a new report from the group he's the lead researcher it's called hidden tribes saying the story of polarization and the United states there's a lot more going on when you dig and Stephen ... a lot of dig into some of these groups more but I Want to ask a big ...\nOf these these people are in this exhausted majority what can we do with this information what can we do a to engage them and maybe the polarized maybe get along a little better\nI think the first thing we have to do is recognize that there's really a problem in our political discourse we asked a lot of questions about this in our in our study and one of the dynamics that was really\nStriking to us was that people both recognize that there is a problem of hate speech in our country and it needs to be addressed and that there's a problem of political correctness of of of policing speech and people taking offense very easily\nThese dynamics are really difficult to navigate for most people and it's causing them to retreat from politics it means they don't want to post on line they don't want to engage in the conversation at work or over the dinner table with their family Thanksgiving and that is\nA fundamental obstacle to us being able to work together because we're not having those conversations we're not seeing the best in each other and were free to draw these caricatures\nUm these kind of cartoon version of the other side to make them out to be worse than they are\nI think the second thing we need to do is recognize that there really are fundamentally different world views different cultures and stories that were telling on the left in the right\nOn the left there's a story that's about allowing the individual to prosper and flourish and have a lot of freedom that we need to be careful about authority because too much authority is suffocating and its oppressive and we need to be respectful and focus on freedom and equality that's a good story on the right there's a story that says let's be careful\nIndividuals' left to their own devices can be selfish they can make mistakes and they can uh they need good leadership they need strong families they need strong culture they need religion they need education to being out the best solved self discipline is very important\nFamily is very important and those are two stories that both have degrees of merit and need to be told at the same time and instead they're vilified the worst versions of these stories are used to characterize each other and we don't hear what each side is trying to bring to the table\nI Want to jump to this group or one in four people as you say the politically disengaged and I've heard over the years people from the left and the right saying\nThere's all these people out there we know they agree with us if we just to activate them we're going to win every election uh it's way more complicated than that what did you learn about this quarter of Americans who fall into this politically disengaged\nCategory [noise] well this is a group that is disproportionately young they're um the group that's most likely to have children under the age of Eighteen that they're still raising a this is a group that includes a lot of people who are lower income who have less education uh for them\nPolitics and national story is a little bit of a luxury for their time they're more focused on raising their children making sure they get to their shift at work\nMaking sure they finished their degree um and so they're not as engaged in politics they're focused on other things\nThere are also group that's quite discouraged and they don't see\n'em they see politics as both intimidating on the one hand because it's complex than that ... you know it's a different world in some ways but also as a place that is frustrating because they don't see a root for their engagement they don't see a payoff for their participation in politics\nUm is is also a group that um is a bit prone to conspiratorial thinking we ask them questions and our study the gauge\nPeople's propensity to believe in stories about conspiracies at a grand scale and and this was a group that uh gravitates to words as as well so it's it's a low information group they don't um it with regards to politics and they're not very active politically in and across the board so they're not\nThinking about politics now watching on TV as much than a posting about it on social media and they're not voting very often either we're talking about\nPolarization and the United states with Steve\nThe hidden tribes who's with the group more in common it Doug beyond the left or right to debate this study you did and found a lot of different groups of people in the United states seven of them to be precise you can join in at eight hundred six four to one two three four\nDo you feel like the extremes on both ends of the political spectrum get too much attention do you feel like\nYour views are left out like a a middle ground is left out sometimes do you identify with one of the groups are you've heard our guest talk about do you feel like hey yeah I Am and in that politically disengaged group ... tell us tell us why you don't feel like politics as part of your life\nCall eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four
