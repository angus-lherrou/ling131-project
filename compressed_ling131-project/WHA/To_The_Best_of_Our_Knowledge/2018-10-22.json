all of these interviews on Wisconsin vote\nDot org very we talked to ... to lose a Democrat running to be Wisconsin state treasurer she's the co founder of the venture capital firm muscle partners\nSurrogate Lucy thanks for joining us today things from thanks for having me I Want to talk about the existence of the office of treasure and past elections we've talked to candidates who wanted to eliminate the office or is this campaign ended voters rejected a constitutional amendment\nYou were working to keep it talk about why you want there to be a state treasurer was ...\nYeah that's exactly how I got involved in this day treasures races that being in business and finance rod my entire career I was completely a hall that we were going to get rid of our financial officers are independently elected financial office that's like\nYou know in my world firing your chief financial officer and firing your auditor and giving those responsibilities to a CEO\nWe would never do that in business so why do we think that would be good government\nAnd on was part of the leaders for that bipartisan fiscal watchdog group and and traveling estate talking about what the state treasurer should or could be doing it just became clear that this office has been neglected for well over a decade\nOn and that's why I decided to throw in my hat and run for it because I really know what can make a difference for Wisconsin\nNot just collected but specific tasks of the streets they treasure have been separated from the office and put elsewhere what do you see as the role of the state treasurer given the limited tasks at hand\nYeah there are three things I Believe this office should be doing for Wisconsin I it's the first is that this office should be a fiscal watchdog I mean currently in our government the governor and the legislature they tax you\nThey didn't tell you how they're going to spend your money and then they spend your money and they account for it this is like a violation and internal controls and finance one oh one I mean we would now it's kind of like the Fox watching the hen house kind of thing\nAnd so what this office should be doing because it has nothing to do with the budget process it has nothing to do with taxation is it should come in and say did your tax dollars were they spent the way that they said they would be and currently that's not happening in\nThe second thing that that is also should be doing as it should be your financial advocate um do you remember that well when the Wells Fargo kick people off of their loans and raise their interest rates so state treasurer around the country were saying you can't do that to our people and so they literally find to them they canceled financial agreements and in Wisconsin when that happened we did nothing\nGood die or how did you uh did you watch\nOh my God why [laughter] they asked them and they show him and\nI went to the last game of the thirtieth or this season\nSo I haven't actually seen a lot from the ... first Thursday games and then that way it is that the first Monday in a national it was just incredible I have such good memories my dad was the last time that my dad\nSaw game was it was in with the growers so\nUm it was just incredible credible for me to see that and set up to ... I think that next chair watch out\nYeah I agree Randy thank you so much for sharing that eight hundred six four to one two three four and bill\nAre you what what's the season been like for you as a brewers fan this was the most fun season that I can ever remember I mean ... or ... I was one year old when they went to the world series in Nineteen eighty two I kept my memories are little foggy you know personal memories of that one\nUp but they've had a couple of they've had a few good years since then most of their years you know we're kind of bad to average at best quite frankly they've really gotten better over the last few years and if you would have told me way back in February that hey the brewers are going to be one went away from going to the world series I Would have said\nYou have no idea what you're talking about your career you know it's not going to happen\nBut here they are it was such a great ride so many great moments during the season to cheer about um how could you not have a great time to go back to our callers now Jim is with us in bloom or a Jim hello\nAnd huge brewer fan but with a bunch of games this year I fortunately did not have a chance to go to the post season but the only thing that I Would change is a I really feel sorry for the guy was Jeffers I Do not understand like also fraud and Jeffers\nWith the did not proven himself over the last two or three weeks of the year\nOr where he struggled and he did it again it goes from two to one and it was just it just like it slated everything when he got to let those are three runs on that over on it was very disappointing but you know I I I'm not putting the first down but I just really do feel sorry for Jeffers because uh\nHe had struggles in the last two or three weeks but this year it boy that really trust this stuff\nAnd Jim do you have high hopes for that twenty Nineteen season\nOh huge huge especially with the uh the way he started a lot of post season I think you can play cause a lot of damage that fear though if a a whore nuclear so we have\nFact a legal ...

I'm I'm a little old fashioned I think you know can't can't we get starting pitchers that can reliably ghost six Senate ... crate councils philosophy is and you look at the the analytics you look at the stance in statistically speaking\nA pitcher's third time's through the line up the odds of success begin to favor the hitter\nAnd so councils just like you know what I'm not immune to deal with that I'm just going to bring in a fresh arm and keep the other team honest\nAnd uh so that's why a lot of the brewery stars weren't going that long and then a couple of times I think I forget which game it was I think it was the last one in Los Angeles so I guess game five he brought wait my Leon\nTo pitch to one batter although\nNo one really thought that was the plan and he put Miley out there so that uh Los Angeles would put more a right handed hitters up a so then he\nPulls Molly out after the first batter brings in a lefty and now all of a sudden or brings in a writer you know all of a sudden the Dodgers wound up is all screwed up because they don't have the right you know a\nBetter picture match ups there so it's kind of\nHe's been playing that for most of the last half of the season and it's for the most part it's worked out pretty well for them to come in and a twenty Nineteen season really excited though I Am I I it's I I Can't wait for the season to begin I hate that this season is over but now let's get this next them under way I think they're gonna they're gonna be even better and\nIt very well may be there you're All right we'll hold you to that they'll thanks ... coming over to the studio at Central time producer and burn super fan built Martin thanks for your calls and your comments on the ideas network Facebook page still time for you to chime in there by the way uh what did you think of the season what are you looking forward to in twenty Nineteen\nI think a big part of it is um you know side is psychological to ... you know you can a lot of times you know I've been writing about money for the past five or six years and one thing I always hear people say is why don't they teach the stuff in school just if I just learned this in school that'd be good with money\nWell that's not necessary [laughter] you know financial knowledge is one part of the equation the other part is this is really about your habits in your behavior\nUh so that's a big part of what my book is about is I really talk about the psychology behind why it's hard to understand why it's hard to get personal finance you know\nIt's not just the knowledge you can be you can do all the math and learn all the money rules and learn how four oh one case work but if you don't have a control if you don't have some control over your habits in your behavior and your mindset can be very difficult to to put that knowledge into practice\nWell let's start putting it into practice to say we have the idea okay a budget that sounds like a good thing one of the basics how can we if we're not budgeting now how can we start a budget that we're actually going to keep track of it actually stick with keeping track of for not just a day but weeks\nWell one of a kind of controversy on that said a lot of personal finance experts talked about this and one that I interviewed in my book says you know get rid of budgets altogether I'm having a spending plan instead\nI Will let you in on a secret Rob a budget and spending plan are pretty much the interesting thing but ... is is just that it's a plan for your money and how you're going to use it but with one crucial difference\nIn that you have a goal for it you have something you're working toward whether it's saving you know paying off at ten thousand dollar loans that like I said you could move into a bigger place or you know in my case you could move out of your mother's [laughter] or maybe it's saving five thousand dollars for an amazing trip to South America was the spending plan you are it's\n... is the main thing driving all of your financial decisions\nOn and I think just having that you know I'm ... can really help you actually stick to a budget so again when you go to those really tough money decisions where you\nWhere you have a choice of saying yes or no you're going to say yes to your goal so you're going to make better decisions that support you instead of you know you're going to feel like money is working for you instead of the other way around\nAnd you write that one of the obstacles to sticking with a budget or spending plan which are ... and we want to call it is that that impulsive moment and you give some sort of practical advice on how to uh maybe rethink those impulsive purchase decisions can you share a couple with us\nOh yeah I'd love to so that's a big part of sticking to about just like impulsive spending emotional spending stress spending and I think just understanding the weird ways in which your brain works against you is a big step in the right direction um there are a lot of like cognitive biases that kind of\nAgain weird ways our brain works against us there are a lot of cognitive biases that get in the way when it comes to money specifically one of them is the phone costs fallacy\nAnd with the cost fallacy it's basically when you um [noise]\nYou keep making a decision that might not be the right decision because of time or resources money that you've already invested in that decision\nI you know this comes into play with investing a lot but it also comes into play with day to day spending decisions I Will give you a personal example if you are I'm at let's say that you you you have it in your head that you need to go to ... and get you know this little night stand or something you saw on line\nYou drive all the way to ikea you fight for parking you go through their little ah the ... that is ikea\nAnd you discovered they don't have the table you want but you you came all the way you fought for parking you know you have to buy something I don't want to show you know I Can't leave here empty handed so then you spent three hundred dollars and a bunch of stuff that you might not necessarily need and didn't really budget for because of that phone cost fallacy\nWhich are Christian walk her new book is get money live the life you are not just the life you can afford it you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four do

I think you know everybody should have something like that as far as when to use it and what not to use it I mean I think there are some things that we inherently kind of know are emergencies and some things that\nUm we think are emergencies but not might not be and I talk about like some really specific examples of this in my book but you know even in the case of like if your car breaks down you know one question I Would\nAsk is is this something that you need right now could you or is there another option available for you what are your other options for emergency options could you you know take the bus could you take public transportation maybe the maybe your answer to that is no\nUm but if it's yes then maybe you hold onto your emergency fund while you save up for that car repair something like that\nSo you know it's not always completely obvious when you shouldn't shouldn't use your emergency fund I think a lot of times people think the rules are very cut and dry like that but I think as long as you're thinking in terms of like\nYou know how what are my other options I'm when I'm In the state of emergency or is this something that I Need to address immediately I Would say any health concerns are usually something you want to dress immediately because that might end up costing you more which is another question to ask them for use your emergency fund like if I ignore this problem right now is it going to cost me even more down the road\nIn that case I might want to take care of it now\nYou mentioned your emergency fund giving you a feeling of control and you write that some people look at the overall economy or student loan debt up a lot of things are beyond people's control\nOf the job market wages things like that and that might disheartening people uh make discourage people from trying to control their own finances you say no actually the opposite that makes it more important to control what you can\nYeah I think so because\nFactors outside of our control that they're kind of working against us which is why I think it's it's", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "22"}
