the contemporary fascism is just beginning [noise] and he says the U.S under President Trump is part of the swing towards fascism [noise]\nA steep often wondered if Freeman isn't made a little too free with that word rub\nGenerally think fascism in historical terms something that's more or less ended with Hitler and Mussolini but you say fascism is once again on the rise ... where do you see it or to the many places in Europe and also he wouldn't be United States of America but it's a point\nShe could have disappeared I mean it's a very strange mistake\nGreat intellectuals office like almost ... and ... on us already after World War two Ninety four to seven they said please don't make the mistake these wall is open ... did not to disappear why you said that they made this claim because they realized ferry we will\nThat fascism ... anti democratic spirit it's the political expression of the worst of human instinct\nThe phenomenon of ... is not based on the ideology because we know audio ... do we know positive id behind it and this is not a clearly sought out vision of the future it's something else\nYeah it's the exploitation of the worst sentiments in as a human beings and I must democracies different by fear greet the scientists and opens the gate for them uh cooks and populous charismatic figures\nWho are functioning as a kind of false\nMy size because ... is a form of a secular religion that's what it is there's also you know why people want to believe these strongman most of the um it's a strongman who present himself as the anti politician leader who will cure suicide you all social evils\nNo usually the label that is used to identify some of these people and we should get to specifics in a moment is they are populists him but you you sort of object to that word I mean you say that's often a dodge that that's a cop out that we don't actually call it for what it is yeah well look\nDonald Trump also populist and Bernie Sanders also popular ... also populist if everybody's a populist and nobody is false you know this whole notion of populism is indeed an kinds of euphemism to avoid the F word\nPeople like Mussolini Hitler the worst examples could make their ... because they were very charismatic leaders and people have a holy faith if they knew how to speak but again next to death go all the other things\nFascism is the final political expression of the anti democratic speed with which will present itself as the anti politician\nWill battled the free press who make gestures suspects or what you're having here now is make the FBI suspect\nWill be ... and we'll be constantly in need because again there are no positive fight is he has to create a crisis and he has to exploit\nThe forms of resentment and fear and hatred in a society to activate the base here saying there's not a clear ideology of okay this is what we want to do with the country it's more\nIt's a series of resentment and hatred\nIt's old technique that's why it's a tremendous mistake to think we can only recognized ... if it looks like as we have seen it\nIn black uniforms with Julie justice as we sold in the food in the forties that still the case what is the case is that at the time of styling\nThe people in the Soviet Union Boston are ... ... they all spoke in terms of so we are dealing he saw fit precious him so for them so you're saying fascism can be on the left as well as on the right Oh absolutely absolutely again it's the anti democratic spirit\nAnd it's the spirits of people from mine said who are only interested in themselves it's all about her own power for that they create these fishy to cope\nWith its religious overtones being the messiah who can do to fix them again if you remember how Trump announced his candidacy he came from\nQuote unquote happen [laughter] downstairs on the elevator ethical vengeance\nAll these things you're making a serious charge or I mean you're calling Donald Trump a fascist\nHis absolute the or the men ... minded but look I mean what what is outrageous about it we have the same feeling in Hungary we have for in Austria we have for the turkey have in Russia I mean what's the problem with just telling the truth\nBecause I think when we think about fascism or a fascist movement there's the sense that it sweeps aside all governmental institutions and you know Trump could very easily I voted out and twenty twenty we have a you know ... ... we have show but you see if you see what's happening if you'll institutions right now\nMake the free press suspect make the churches suspect\nBecause quote unquote L all the enemy of the people and Mr Trump is the greatest representative of the people whatever that may be the institutions are as strong as the people are but the base behind every institution is trust\nTrust is gum the institutions will go at the end of the day so this was a great message which a German immigrant in Nineteen fifty eight\nThe Noble Prize winner told his mom gay when he here in America went on the coast to coast on whole a lecture to talking about the Komen victory of democracy and he said to the Americans at that time\nPlease listen to me I come from unique I've seen the rise of the ... movement in my home town with Mr Hitler and then spreading all over Europe\nDon't make the mistake\nFascism can in faith the whole democratic system which then will collapse and didn't Thomas months say that fascism will rise in America in the name of freedom\nYes because the ferry important strategy of all leaders refer ... mines that is the political flies they a pathological liar so all of them\nAnd so it will come in the name of freedom or democracy they know how to use the rhetoric they know how to use the slogans they are in need of propaganda machines so what I Want to come back to the word again because I guess maybe I'm getting hung up on trying to actually label some of these politicians fascists\nThe word that's used for a lot of these people who were coming to power including Donald Trump is authoritarian or you know look at some other countries in the word strongman is use\nPeople tend to avoid that word fascism because it is so loaded it is so connected to the historical legacy of Hitler and loosely in particular why are you so insistent on calling these people fascists it's not that difficult to understand that if you see what has happened in Europe [noise]\nMultiple which started out of the blue for no good reason by the killing of a crown prince owned the twenty eight of June Nineteen fourteen and a couple of months later the whole thing all set on fire\nThen because the rise of the fish east movements in Germany Italy frogs sparing central Europe than it was almost a fourth one I Want people to understand is that the developing which we're seeing now in Western Europe\nAnd in America is the rise of these anti democratic spirit and that it will come with consequences and the consequences are indeed fine that smell this debate count argument rope you cannot speak about fishing because the filing seasonal death well\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI specifically look for wounded white kids kids would have been through some drama they were the ones who were most ripe for message recruited\nVehemently all the time and if you didn't get recruited by me I was just as happy to break your face for you and I got in the street fights constantly I Would attack pretty much anybody or bitter early at any given time just for the thrill of violence\nAnd I was a lead vocal for\nA very popular or a power band\nIn many ways I was exactly the way it is used to be he was part of the same gang of eight are pumped start he was also in white barbarians I Would be stunned if he had never heard of my band and I would not be surprised if he was a fan of the music that I made screaming and people to go and ... because of the color of their skin\nI Can't imagine I mean you're a former white supremacist what what is it like to get an email from her deep and that must have been incredible what was that like\nI was actually super excited I was really honored\nIn the weeks following all this stuff I did a ton of media\nThat was doing media like eight to ten hours a day from all over the world because I had been\nDoing these education work as a gay for my wife in front of us for a couple of years already at that point and I already had a pretty high profile and\nI had a real mixed feelings about all the media I was doing because I wasn't as transition point rose going from being an energy consultant to being a professional speaker author\nAnd honestly nothing better could have happened through my perspective career this example shooting wow and I the entire time I'm\nDoing all these interviews I've just wanted to go back to remove servers if it could have brought these six people back\nBut at the same time there's always a part of me internally that wants to beat myself up through I was and what I've done and that part of me was very much at the forefront family oh good job on did you go get some speaking gigs and sell some books\nBecause people are dead\nParty but I Wonder at this point when you guys are having dinner together where you were you aware of how far behind aren't put his past and with that part of the reason you want to talk to them\nNow at this point I really wasn't aware how far\nIs history was are very ... you know if you put it in the past even so you didn't know that he had really changed\nNo no I I mean I had um you know and I had a hunch that he changed but as the dinner day was getting closer and closer and closer and as I shared with family and friends\nWhat I was about to do and who I was about to talk to I Would assume your mom did not like that at all in all my mom didn't like that my wife didn't like that there's people who are in the community who had just gone through this\nParty [laughter] what did you get out of our meeting with are now it seems like he was a racist violence man's kinda the opposite of who you are it's like it seems like you have a lot to offer him but what is it what does he get out for you\n[noise] so I mean does this come back to understanding if you don't understand why somebody would be able to do something like this\nAnd have answers I I don't think that you can genuinely process and he'll you can fake it I was definitely faking it after August that because I knew we had to put on a brave face for the world\nFor me are law has been my greatest therapist and I am a therapist [laughter] so I [laughter] I guess they've been my brother and my ... we've had a lot of battles together and the battles are political battles are personal but as far
