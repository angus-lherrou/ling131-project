[noise] so when I was a kid growing up those were the first books that I reach\nPeople want to think about it they think of the the wizard of Oz the first book but they don't know about asthma applause there were all these other strange and unusual but\nLoving characters it was just amazing to me and here's Dorothy having all these adventures but not just Dorothy there was all kinds of warring factions and royalty but it was mainly just regular people just trying to get through their day\nThat was the thing that really struck me about the characters in ... and sometimes it was a toughie chicken [noise]\nI don't know what it is about me and chickens but I Love them so much and I think it probably started with odds [noise]\nTime period that I first came across as books my parents had gone through [noise]\nReally horrible divorce [noise]\nUm my dad let those books behind\nWhen I became an editor and started editing that type of work\nThat's what really brought my dad and me back together ...\nMy dad had always wanted to be a writer but he ended up going to medical school and he became a doctor is dead and every thing that I did every book project that I worked on I always had him in the back of my mind\nDad recently passed away last summer and um when I went with my sisters and we were looking through all of his different papers and things like that we were surprised to find so much poetry\nAnd short little fiction things and I had no idea that he was still writing [noise]\nSo that was [noise]\nReading everything that he wrote and it just meant a lot to me that we were able to connect to fiction [noise]\nAnd ... is an award winning editor and publisher of weird fiction and that makes her an authority on story world [noise] which is our topic is our world than that magic trick writers do is creating a whole fictional world\nFor characters to live in places like ... or west rose or planet of the apes\nAnd writers do this all the time\nThis hour George Saunders will tell us how he created a graveyard afterlife for Abraham Lincoln son Willie marked for us we'll talk about inventing a surreal little town called Twin Peaks but first let's get ... to explain the class of building a completely imaginary fantastic\nFictional [noise]\nI Do believe that there's more of a responsibility on the fantasy or the science fiction writer because you can't take as much for granted you really need to know the world that you're building even if you don't put it on the page you need to know it well enough\nAnd then you also have to balance between what you're going to share with the reader and what you hold back because what you don't want to end up doing is you don't want to end up\nThe towns that we shot the show and all those years ago when I went back to shoot in last year that it was just simply something they felt the kinship to win and were drawn to in a mysterious ways so the whole thing has a ... a very strong sense of mystery\nI can say wow this is really something it definitely it marked now would be a great time to have you read an excerpt from the secret history of Twin Peaks I was thinking about the eulogy that the log lady reads at a memorial service and if you could set it up that would be great\nA dear friend of the log ladies and many people in town\nHas passed away they've had a memorial service on the shores of of Pearl lake\nAnd at the end of the service Margaret stands up to speak on behalf of her friend and the notes in the book that are jotted down by the the deceased brother are the only record we have of what Margaret set and this is his account\nMargaret holds her log and looks around really looks for some time before speaking this is now Mm\nAnd now we'll never be a gab\nBlue sky cool air and green green forests\nMountains lakes streams [noise] the when\nThe when the water or in there and fire Mm red and yellow and purple and white and we come from the elemental\nAnd return to it in there is change but nothing as last\nOh there's much we cannot see air for instance most of the time\nBut knowing our next breath will follow our last without fail is an active face Mm\nIs it not in dark times will always come as night follows day Mm\nA dark age will test us all each and every one\n[noise]\nTrust and do not Trump [noise] in the face of the unknown [noise]\nIt shall not remain unknown to you\nFor a long [noise]\nAs well we all [noise]\n\nThat's great thank you mark thank you I come from a long line of him [laughter] yeah and it's working for you [laughter]\nIn the opening statement of your novel the archivist talks about the difference between mystery and secrets and it seems to me that mystery and secrets or two of the major themes in both the twin peaks TV series and enter novel what do you think\nI Would agree with that I Would say that the idea of mystery is something that is profoundly inherent in all of reality it's the Joseph cambell mystery as opposed to a murder mystery I it's it's a sense\nThat there's something going on\nJust beneath the surface of what we can perceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there's something of an accent and\nHard to grasp at and very often seems just beyond our reach but there are times that our lives when we catch glimpses of it now\nAnd UFOs identified flying objects also come up on more than one occasion and why did I Want you to launch include so much us though content\n[noise] number one we had dealt with it in a in a very particular and specific way and the second season of the show\nNumber two it becomes a kind of a stand in for this idea of the mysterious experience and as I delved pretty deep into UFO history\nYou quickly realize this is a phenomenon that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition and inhuman storytelling of people being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings that they have no explanation for understanding I cite\nAn example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament sees this flaming cherry it in the sky\nAnd talks of meeting these giants the L O game it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that a very ... yeah and then I'd I uncovered in in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky and says well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experience it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you call this have you know going further back in ... the Wright brothers and things they should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of experiment\nI mean and the ... in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they called it encounters with that ferries are elves are in Germany they were cobalt or trolls or worms that lived in the mountains even when we were up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and\nMichael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people have told him one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas where the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge\nYou also leave conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully and these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nWhile I've thought about this a lot because you know I was a\nI was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed\nWith getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became a kind of alternative way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on\nConventional or authoritative voice is that there were perhaps other ways of of viewing it I I think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and\nShining example of American political history could be taken out\nBy somebody as small as insignificant and as\nStupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThan it can't be random there's gotta be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a justice sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the world\nExactly once that gets started once the ball gets rolling it's pretty hard to stop\nDefinitely final question what do you think he's the ...\nSupport for WPRI comes from west Johnson credit union announcing the annual scholarship program for graduating high school seniors from communities served by west dots an opposite is guidelines an application or at West conference EU dot org\nWant to you want to make them laugh you want to pick and cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps on the edge of their seat but to go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function of the storyteller and the culture is that it's our job\nTo keep mythology alive for people that it's akin to what ... did in the first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past\nAnd that somehow in live in the president and I I like to think that at its best that's what storytellers do for our culture now\nAnd ... with\nMark frost is the author of the secret history of Twin Peaks [laughter] he's the co creator along with David Lynch at the TV series the third season of Twin Peaks debuted on may\n\nThis year's Booker Prize went to George Saunders for Lincoln in the ... his complex multi character novel set during the civil war President Abraham Lincoln beloved son Willie dies probably of typhoid fever\nIs only eleven years old Lincoln is overcome with grief and this is the cemetery Crips many times to hold his boy's body\nSteve wholesome talk with George scientists when the book first came out and they began with a reading\nCan you explain what's going on in the scene\nYeah there's a convention in the book that when a ghost\nYou sort of Cohen habits the same space as a living person the ghost gets a kind of temporary omniscient the person's thoughts dream becomes fully available to the ghost so they're Lincoln has entered the tune and Willie is kind of watching him watching Lincoln sauce over the physical body\nI mean in in a sense it's maybe analogous to purgatory although it's more driven by the use or you could say like the the person for both of the bottle can get out if he or she is just willing to kind of face the music particularly the music of their own ... you know the thing that they brought forward from life\nThat's not allowing them to go onto the next step\nSo the danger of the ... you can get stuck there or you can sort of be trapped there for eternity\nYeah and then that's probably more ... than the actual Tibetan borrow but at some point I kind of had to break from it and and make a\nYou know a whole new concept of what might happen when we die mainly because my guess is not having done it but my guess is that whatever happens it's going to be a real shocker [laughter]\nAnd ah [laughter] and it it is not going to be like oh this is just what we were told so so that was part of the the writing challenge was to make a bottle that had some resemblance to what we think the afterlife might be but be different enough that we shared in some of that this orientation that a natural that person would feel\nJust this resonate for you personally I mean that's more than just the literary device but any sort of the Buddhist concept of ...\nOh yeah my wife and I having students of of Buddhism for a while I'm just you know a total beginner but it back and flex this life\nIn a sense you if the ideas that when you when you die your mind is basically like a wild horse that gets a lot of the tether because now it's not dampened by your physical body anymore\nAnd the mind in that state they say can do anything it can travel it can be on a mission that can experience horrible visions are beautiful visions much like our idea of having\nWell if that's the case the way we cultivate and train our minds right now is is really key\nSo you know you can see it as a a literal afterlife or if that doesn't sushi you could see it as a metaphor for the fact that we're making heaven and hell this instant by our our habits of mind and then the kind of hopeful thing which is that you theoretically could cultivate a state of mind\nThat was more patient and more loving and more sane than the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway is that had been how\nOur right now and they're not beyond our ability to influence\nIt seems like there's also a connection to be made between literature and religion that they're they're both exercises in world building and even if you see religion as representing an underlying reality they're both ultimately imaginative exercises\nYes they are you know I think in world building especially in a book like this which is you get to decide what the rules of ghosts are you get to build them and what was interesting to me was I didn't start off with a bunch of rules I just started out with trying to make\nInteresting lines in the book basically and fund dialogue or vivid images and what's interesting is as you do this kind of intuitive approach with the thousands of the draft the world starts first of all it starts being\nVery consistent you can see which rules have to apply and then the really magical thing was that you know about year three\nWith the rules in place the rules started kind of producing weird fruit you know there would be [laughter] turns in the plot that I hadn't anticipated that were really meaningful and and I found really moving\nThat weren't really me doing it it was the rules of the world saying well if a therefore be it's a kind of a cliche but I for writer so you know you're like a midwife the book is there a perfect\nStrong sense of what it is in your job is to kind of manage your daily activity so it was not to for the things individuality and I had that feeling really strong in the last third of the book and it was just I'm deeply enjoyable I really kind of miss it I have to now get out of making sixty two and come back to now\nCharged ... new novel his first is called Lincoln in the barrio
