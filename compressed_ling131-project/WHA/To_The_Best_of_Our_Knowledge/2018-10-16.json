fifties sixties into the seventies um screenwriters doctors businessmen would use the Dictaphone machines to record correspondence notes scripts\nAnd it's a a plastic delta ... it's a piece of plastic I think it's about six inches wide and uh it can contain you know up to Fifteen sixteen minutes of\nMaterial and they put it on the machine and talking to the microphone and it would impress a groove onto the plastic\nAnd Louis can you talk about the significance of having rod Serling voice talking about what he wanted to a film weather is on the TV show OR Books or whatever\nOf course I'm so one of the really cool things is how unrehearsed addict about SARS so we're very used to hearing ... voice as this very polished kind of all powerful narration and whether it be the twilight zone or night LA so when you first tune into these dipped developed and kind of\nUncertainty and in ... it's just you have this kind of\nImmediate and counter to what you're used to and so it tells you a lot more about the person and what kind of stuff do hear rod Serling saying on the news it's Breivik riding mostly scripts and it's very um\nVery technical so he's staying he's vocalizing all the stage directions all the punctuation but you also see you also have an excuse me here\nMany of his correspondents or\nI've even heard him kind of dictate to do list I'm too as assistant Marjory I'm and so you it's a broad variety but it's mostly script well\nLet's give a listen now to the voice of rod Serling on one of these are dictated ... recordings\n[noise] hiring looking down on this memo invest

tiptoeing tribal tribal right here I hear your right to to get it out because they're pushing\nHard if your company and said hey we've got this rod Serling spoken word poetry [laughter] I Would avoid that he's a ... there was a rod Serling style here right\nYeah yeah it's amazing I mean he started dictating his scripts early in his TV career and that was his preferred way of working so he didn't sit at a typewriter and type it out and then make changes it's just coming straight from his mind onto the ticked about\nWhat's it like to listen to these recordings that were your twilight zone watcher before this young gallery or\nUm twilight zone we I've started um examining gallery as well which has been a fun discovery but um it's just the first one I heard he addresses his assistant directly in the first\nSix seconds and you're just suddenly in the face of hearing him talk to you and it is like he is talking to you and you do get totally immersed in the storytelling and so it means that the corrections and the punctuation are very jarring when you finally hear them\nUh and you do kind of take a step back and try to figure out exactly what he's doing\nAnd your first reaction is surely he's reading off of something 'cause it's stuff like the question marks and the quotes you it it certainly that's not all in his memory\nUm but then you find out that it is and then you hear him\nI'm kind of hem and haw about like what quality of olive after he wants to go for it and so it's this again this kind of wonderful mix where you kind of hear his genius and that he can just kind of go on these long monologues about human nature and then also not remember what he named someone in a previous stick developed\nMary held back home and from your W Madison looking at to these Rob Serling ... recordings on his effort to keep her preserved them for the future and married when I talk about that this is the kind of technology that isn't going to last forever\nRight that's a part of the reason we we wrote a grant and we're lucky enough to get a grant from the council of counseling library and information resources they got money from the Andrew W melon foundation to to hand out these grants\nThat took the boats are plastic and like any plastics they deteriorate and they've started to deteriorate enough to make us very about them but also the machines aren't being made anymore so it's a challenge to find people who who can digitize them\nSo right now if I was a film and TV researcher and I was like wow I can hear rod Serling creative process at work I'd have to come here right yeah and hope you have a working to develop that right\nWell yeah that's very nice of you are on these weren't acceptable to anyone because we don't have a working Viktor Bout machine and you also need to be really careful where digitizing any legacy material whether it's audio or video or film\nThat you have the proper equipment in the proper expertise to do that and we just didn't have that so uh we worked with a company called scene savers\nUh um and they've done a fabulous job for us\nSo they're all digitized now is that right or are we on the way\nYeah all the sterling picked about seven digitized as well as we have ...\nUh as well as another screenwriter Adrian species and the producer Walter ...\nWow and so how do you know if I'm that film and TV researcher or what to what we can I Do or how can I access\nTo the go to the Wisconsin Center for film and theater research and talk to marry [laughter] um I\n... that dealt in the very least you can just um request ahead of time and you can go and listen to them on a boom box there I'm certainly ones are still in that process of coming out more publicly so you get in contact with Mary\nAmerican you talk about the value of artifacts like this for American culture\nYeah I mean\nThis is such a unique recording for ... and um people dying off and save these you know it's remarkable that\nUh Serling and Marjory lands for his assistant save them and thought to send them to us I'm usually these just got tossed after a they had been transcribed so we would be missing out on hearing the voice and hearing the process\nCan you talk about that because there are probably a lot of artists out there I mean going back centuries where you'd love to be able to hear your voice a word or we can see the final product of the money is that it what is it like being able to watch it developed in stages\nWell one thing and it's not too I'm just credit Serling zone worker traumas but one thing that's really interesting is to incite you get into the process and the multiple people involved in the process\nHas one thing that kind of unsung hero for me of studying addict developed is Marjorie Lankford or in the case of trauma he had to write hideous distance mostly his family um transcribing these for them but you can also here based off of the way that\nSterling and turned to speak to them and also the tasks that are being granted to them how heavily involved these assistance and secretaries and chocolate first work in the creative process\nOn and so that was a really I think it it's really hard to deny their influence when you hear them getting a directly addressed you're hearing the tasks that are given to them\nAnd you remember that we would not have these records or the script even without their contribution so that's been my favorite and most um fruitful insight I think\nI've done some transcribing harder it is grueling work yeah social when somebody speaking in you're out the site of their thoughts not going down for you yeah yeah so uh what what is next how are you hoping these ultimately get used\nMarry well we're hoping that uh scholars both television and film scholars will come to Madison to listen to them to not only gain new insight into ... career but the screen writing process um you know how\nFilm and television developed a especially in the late Nineteen sixties or I think there's just a myriad of ways that people could use these\nAnd before we wrap up where we have you gone back and watched episodes you for being detailed in Washington yes\nUm well the the original until listen to where it kind of bits and pieces are harder to find but the night gallery he has extensive stick to build on and so I have been trying to compare and contrast a bit of the gallery episode eyes which we had the ...\nAnd that's been really cool to kind of see what drastic changes there are and what carries over and things like\nWill thanks to both of you for coming up to the studio\nThe situation that they're in and she says she talks about having to go back to Haiti where she's never benches and speak Creole she has no idea what she would do their\nUm or does she stay here when her parents go back and then she's forced to either live with another family or she put it'd be thrown into the system\nAnd have a foster family or something like that and and the worries at that ... that that brings with it so yeah it's just really interesting to see it firsthand and to understand to hear the debates that they're having and I can tell you that this one family is is is embodiment of what's going on and thousands of households around the country\nUm as as as their legal as they were made in this legal limbo and they face that very real prospect of having to be ordered back home um possibly soon or depending on how quickly the legal cases are resolved\nAlan Gomez is immigration reporter at USA Today about immigration issues including the temporary protected status program I may be coming to an end for many people protected under that program\nAllan you mentioned legal limbo a lot of what the Trump Administration has changed and immigration has gone to the courts where does this temporary protected status program stand in terms of legal challenges and actually being implemented\nYeah so this is just one of the many a times by the Trump Administration to limit both legal and illegal immigration that has a let's say run into some hiccups in the courts I'm a federal judge a couple of weeks ago on California a rule that the administration you used a flawed legal reasoning\nA flawed process um two and the program um and in that ruling a judge Edward Chen or made clear that he felt and there was enough evidence to show that the administration may have used quote\nAn enemy is against non white non European immigrants to reach its conclusion are meant to reach its decision to end this program so he prevented he
