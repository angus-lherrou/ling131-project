this week a Canadian professor became only the third woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for physics\nWe'll talk with a researcher of trends in this down the science technology engineering and math fields about what this might mean about the changing experiences of women in science first between now and November six the general election Wisconsin\nPublic radio has invited candidates were running in contested races for statewide office and congressional seats to join us for interviews here on central time and on the morning show you'll be able to find all these interviews at Wisconsin vote dot org\nToday we talked to Travis heart wiggle Republican running to the Wisconsin state treasurer he previously worked as a mutual fund administrator Travis are awake thanks a lot for joining us today\nThanks for having me on Rob and I was like to start off real quickly here and I apologize to your listeners I got a little bit of a cold going on here but in the last two weeks we don't stop our campaign it's at a time of year how to hold season [laughter]\nWell let's talk about an issue that is in common and a lot of election races the existence of the office of Wisconsin state treasurer there was an effort to remove it from the U.S though Wisconsin Constitution or some of your predecessors a Republican candidates ran in opposition to the existence of the office what's your opinion on our need for a state treasurer\nWhile I Will be very honest with voters and stay Wisconsin I voted as a as a citizen this spring to actually eliminate the office I Am now running for\nI Believe that in its current state it doesn't make sense for taxpayers that's also the reason I'm running for this office I figured if a if one of the other candidates end up in this office when I have another four years would do nothing office\nAnd it is a very contested issue as well we sent to stay treasures to Madison that pledge to eliminate the office that one in general elections\nAnd then just this spring and the referendum the the voters ultimately decided to keep that office\nUm I think that's very important to note that in the history here um and I think that's really important to look at what the voters are saying in this case it's it's not crystal clear but I think it it's very clear that the voters once a small government office here in office that provides more accountability but they don't want to vastly grow government and that process and that's really we're trying to set up\nOur campaign so what do you see if you're elected what would you do with the role of state treasurer\nI absolutely I wanted to make sure first of all of this position is currently about three hours a week and it is getting paid a fulltime salary about Seventy thousand dollars a year that's unacceptable we need to make sure that this ... this state treasurer is contributing from day one\nI'm I'll be working with the legislator and make sure that we move this position forward um I have a plan out here on my website as well on Travis heart wake dot com for any listeners that would like to check that out\nBut we really want to do three things we want to assist in the audience of state and local government uh provide a little bit of elected oversight and that in that role I'm In the private sector when I was the middleman between mutual fund companies and the auditing firm\nHi thanks for having me\nWell in that piece you share a lot of research out there on women in all stages of a science technology engineering and math field how big a deal is it to see these Nobel Prizes for women in the sciences this year\nI think it's a big deal it's a it's a sign of the times right women have been increasing in their numbers and STEM fields and so we would expect to see more women getting these kinds of words in the future simply because there's more women in the workforce more women do have this kind of work um but I I still think there are real substantial barriers that women face and in some fields\nWe'll get to know summertime talking about those barriers but you see some bright spots kind of a early on up women or girls are being exposed more to science fields and considering them as future options what are we seeing\nWell I think we've seen some really focused effort at addressing this sort of gender disparity in STEM fields on ally has been coming true sort of education policy higher education policy\nThere I think you know in the eighties and seventies there was a real recognition that women were not pursuing these majors at the same rate that they were in the humanities and the liberal arts and so\nA lot of organizations like the American association for the advancement of science the American physical\nSociety chemistry society but also universities National Science foundation started to really develop targeted programs that would address some of these gender disparities whether that was I'm getting young girl is more interested in science things like girls can code and science camps for girls only and then also sort of focusing on how to\nCreate support networks for women moving through that pipeline and so we've seen real improvements in the educational pipeline of women in STEM fields\nAre women are are at parity in the medical science is sort of biology medical scientists but they still are a bit under represented in fields like chemistry and physics\nAnd our other fields where they're particularly under represented\nYeah there's been some recent studies that have actually found that as the sciences we're seeing an increase of women in STEM fields there's been a real drop off in on the computer science and so there's there's there's a lot of concern about sort of what's going on why are women not sort of increasing the number given that you know women are making up\nA a large proportion of college students now why aren't they choosing these degrees\nHow important is it for\nRole models women not human science field to him and successful over the over the decades\nThere's some there's some mixed up findings on the sort of research related role models so I think and we all kind of have an intuitive understanding of why role models matter right when we see people that look like us or\nUm appear like us in a high level positions we can imagine ourselves in those positions so there's a lot of that sort of role modeling that's important people in I think\nA bit more of how we perceive ourselves and how we perceive opportunities but then the the role modeling that's kind of most important especially in education systems in higher education\nIs seen female role models in the classroom rate than people that look like you teaching the courses you're taking seem professors in that field\nI and so there's there's this sort of role model in from the sense of like award winners are super stars are people we see on TV and then the role model and that is really happening in the classroom\nFor women who decided to pursue science is see in the college feel what kind of a school do they start to hit that may turn them away from it or may prevent them from having successful career\nWell I think historically especially in STEM fields there were real obstacles that were related to the the sort of structure of the job the way the science is done you might need to be in the lab every day for really long hours you might have to be on site you might have to go out into the field and collect data or collect samples and so there were sort of\nBarriers to having work life balance or if you had a child\nYou would have to leave the lab for an extended period of time and then you couldn't come back and sort of get your research back on track I think institutions have really tried to figure out ways around some of this\nAh ways that they can alter the structure of the science itself or the way that the job is the way that the job and promotions are designed a and then there's this sort of other issue of harassment in the workplace which you know we've seen a lot in the news lately\nAnd things like title nine sort of formal policies that have said you you can't have gender discrimination in the workplace in the classroom these of obviously had really sort of important effects on keeping women in these fields\nTalking to marry me from Arizona State university looking at a obstacles still out there for women going into science field here's one stat of from\nAbuse we're talking about you wrote a menace fight their papers fifty six percent more of their own members of their own papers fifty six percent more than women do so uh what's behind that what kind of impact that how\n[noise] yeah so this is something that's pretty particular to the academic workforce um citations are how much your research has been recognized by other people and so what some of his research has found is that men are\nBetter able or feel more empowered to promote their own work to cite their own work and then they might also have networks that are citing their work more thoroughly and so it helps to raise their\nReputation the perception of the reputation the perception of the value of their work there was a recent paper that just came out in a political science journal that showed the ways in which Google a scholar citations are biased against women\nI'm younger scholars and scholars doing really risky work and while these by is these are subtle they can have real long term effect if your promotion your tenure\nUh the your ability to getting toward are being invited to give a guess talk is determined by this reputational effect uh into the teaching things are very particular to academic work but it's really important for scientists because that's a lot of how the scientific community assesses the value and impact of your research\nAnd then letters of recommendation these are a big deal and the academic world is that I read this right all women who receive letters of recommendation from the professor year to get a job over there is more likely to be some kind of like this\nAre qualifying statement and those\nYeah like a language they sort of pulled back on the praise of the Kennedy where\nYou might see language that's like he is a very smart he's really ambitious and then with the woman that will say well she's she's very ambitious which can get in the way of her ah getting along with others in the workplace or something right for the compliment will be will be pulled back with some sort of negative comment and while this seems\nWell we can think of individuals' situations where this does or doesn't happen these studies are looking at you know applications across large cross sections of academic scientists and finding these patterns and we see this in job applications but also in applications for students to get into graduate school\nThat the language they use to describe female candidates might refer to their parenting abilities or their ability to get along and to be socially acceptable where the references to the male performance will be about sort of work performance\nOn foot or last few minutes on some of the solutions you propose water a couple of things that you see maybe making a big difference in the short run\nSo I think one of the things that's been really great about this implicit bias issue as there's a lot of social science research looking at how this implicit bias works\nHow common it is and what the long term effects are the implicit bias and so there's just been a slew of research and the last five years that's come out to really show\nThe way in which these biases are um creating barriers to women but barriers that aren't as a parent to us as not having family leave or not being able to take your children to work might be more obvious barrier that women face and so\nI think the research is coming out people are talking about it more and in response to these findings people are organizing and being more cognizant of how they make decisions about who gets awards who's nominated for things\nHow they engage in citation so one of the responses to this gender bias in citation is a\nOne scholar built a website where you can go and check here citations to see that their gender balance you can run the ... by you're developing for course you're teaching to ensure that there's equal representation of people's work so I think people are developing tools to help address some of these problems\nOr a layperson somebody not in the sciences might think well you know as long as somebody's doing science that doesn't really matter who it is but are we may be losing missing out a potential breakthroughs is a big part of the population isn't being given a shot to break into the industry\n[noise] yeah I I think that's one of the underlying reasons why science funders like the federal government and why professional associations are really engaged in tackling some of these gender disparity issues in the workplace because diverse groups of people\nBring more ideas and more creativity to a team and as we've seen in the STEM fields collaborative science team science big groups of scientists working together to solve problems\nAre becoming much more common and so when we have five six seven scientists working on something together it's it's just better for the science have people who come from different perspectives different backgrounds and who think about problems in different ways there are more likely to come up with creative solutions\nGood place to leave it Mary thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me\nVery few and associate professor and Lincoln professor of ethics and public affairs and the associate director of the center for science technology and environmental policy studies at Arizona State University She wrote a piece why more women don't women science Nobel for the conversation\nInclude a street address with an actual street name and they specifically excluded people who might have a PO box as their address\nNow that is thought to be targeted at Native Americans who live on tribal reservations in the states because it's is appears to be the the policy that many\nNative Americans have PO box addresses for facilities on their reservations but that reservations are not laid out with street names as might be suburban neighborhoods um and so the Supreme Court refused to sort of stayed this law\nSo the challenge will be for Native Americans to\nTry to vote in a state where they now don't have a valid ID that they don't have the valid street address that is required\nAnd this is a bet that law has changed in effect since the primary election there's somebody might have been able to do with that box id of Ben and not now do we usually see a change happen that surely with a little time for voters and authorities to adapt to\nYou know we don't usually see legislatures move that quickly on anything really because you know the legislative process all up and takes time\nAnd when states put into effect new laws they would often put in that say that particular law into effect\nIn a subsequent election but not an election that we're facing imminently so the the process of passing the law was not irregular but it was unusual in that they didn't just focus on some\nFuture election beyond twenty six team\nWon a turn in Georgia now that is in other states has really been in the headlines for a different reason and this is something that's going on in the hot seat purging voter rolls which students that they have to do so that people have moved on to the states are\nVoter rolls her questions about how exactly done uh Georgia tens of thousands of people have their voter registration and do we mostly African American what do we know about what's going on in Georgia well\nThere are a couple of different things that are going on in Georgia, Georgia is using a couple of different uh probably two or three different mechanisms to um at least raise questions about voter registration rolls and individual voters\nAre the primary problem or the let me say the problem that is affecting the greatest number of voters or potential voters in Georgia\nIs the fact that George uh\nThe secretary of state who is the head elections official in Georgia has adopted what we refer to as an exact match policy to certify that a particular person is a registered voter and has the right to vote\nSo in Georgia voter registration applications\nThan name that a person puts on their voter registration applications\nMust exactly match the name that is in some other Georgia State database say for the vast majority of people um their driver's license a database\nNow if they if the state of Georgia received an application for somebody registering to vote and there is not literal exact match than the\nVoter registration application is put on hold\nNow when I say and exact match I mean somebody may not have put their middle initial on their voter registration form\nBut they had put it on years ago when they apply for a driver's license or somebody may forget to put the junior after their name or they may have a a compound last name and forget to put the hyphen in or something like that I mean we're talking about very small\nDetails you could have the same name you could have the same address all those different things but any tiny mistake voids the application\nAnd right now they're about fifty three thousand voter registration applications that are being held up at the state level and as you said um most of those about Seventy percent of them are for African American voters\nOr the other thing that's happening in Georgia and and this is similar um using what they call a mismatch standard uh go in ... County Georgia has invalidated six hundred\nAbsentee ballots that had been cast before the election using that same argument that the voter registration application\nAnd that the signature on the absentee ballot somehow was different\nSo here they're looking at the signatures the handwriting signatures that people put on their ballads and they're looking back at applications and if those two don't appear to match exactly than those ballots are being um what we call spoiled there'd be voided and thrown away\nVoters have a record even know if\nDo not they do not have a record in this particular problem I'm so for the the absentee ballots that had been voided that there is at this point unless there is judicial intervention no opportunity for those people to cast a valid ballot\nIn the people who have their voter registration applications on hold the exact match the state sends to each vote or a letter\nThat tells them that their application has been put on hold for some problem\nUm people in that category would be allowed to vote if they went to the polls and cast a provisional ballot but it's um there are concerns about the way the letters written and whether or not it clearly states to people um that their application\nRight to vote so they can start the concern among voting rights advocates in Georgia is that the people receiving those letters will interpret it as the fact that they are ineligible vote\nTalking to Kathleen Dolan distinguished professor and chair of the political science department at U.
