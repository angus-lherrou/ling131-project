could perhaps draw their own conclusions Glenn card\nWow whether it's the Lincoln Center or the cross Bronx expressway certain sounds very loud sounds are supposed to be able to tolerate because there's sold it be good for everybody when they're serving only a certain population [noise]\nWe've been talking about sonic prejudiced but I Wonder if there are ways in which communities of color or disenfranchised neighborhoods have also use found to define and carve out a space I guess I was thinking that\nIsn't that part of the story of the rise of hip hop in the Bronx in the seventies\nVery much so I've also research Harlem and the Nineteen forties and the way that black and brown people black people in Puerto Ricans\nHad conversations about noise in the newspaper in conversations about how do we share space everybody celebrates sometimes\nIt's not that certain people are noise makers and certain people aren't and you'll see from that period the Amsterdam news urging black readers to be more tolerant say of Spanish accents in their community\nThat have when we moved up from the south we were discriminated against for our southern speech so we don't want to think of Spanish as something that doesn't belong or his noisy\nAnd hip hop is another place where ... black and Puerto Rican people together [noise]\nDJ's like Africa and bought a [noise] use sounds from wherever the television from Europe and things like craft work [noise]\nMy mom's record collection\nBringing all those things and creating these new sounds to create a space\nOf togetherness in a way to actually envision a new community versus what was called\nThe burned out Bronx by many people in New York City at the time [noise] [noise]\nYou must hear and\nWhat's the most recent example where you thought yup there it is again\nActually there was a story of a woman in the summer in North Carolina Dr this was covered by the Washington Post in may she was at home celebrating good news she had just heard she was pregnant she had just received a prestigious cardiology fellowship\nAnd she turned on her spot if I play list on a Saturday afternoon\nThree PM and turned on her play list of nineties hip hop [noise]\n\nThings like juvenile and the ... gene Puff Daddy and\nYou know she said she listens to for an hour and was feeling joyful and dancing turned it off\nSat down and watch the news and then there's a knock at her door and her neighbors had called the police on her for playing loud music\nInstead of ignoring it and saying hey it's Saturday someone's in a good mood downstairs or knocking on her door again creating community relationships having a conversation about it\nThey just went straight to the police and the police abruptly knocked on the door scared her in her own home made her feel like even though she has the right to be there that class status to be in this particular place\nShe didn't belong in this neighborhood that her her white neighbors don't tolerate her ways of being an or consciously listening for it we can also amplifies sounds we hear the more we fixate on certain sounds the more we begin to notice and attuned to them\nRight so the story over and over again of\nPeople being silenced literally yes well you're opening up this whole kind of language that to me seems to be about the ethics of listening to the ethics of hearing moving from sonic prejudice to a model of sonic inclusiveness\nBut that is a legacy that I can leave I Will be honored and appreciative I I really encourage people to stop and observe\nReactions that we've come to understand as natural or immediate to sound why am I upset at this particular moment that my neighbor is playing a certain kind of music\nWhy am I accept that my neighbors are using their front yard to have a party versus their backyard sound triggers a lot of these deeply held feelings about race and class\nAnd the way we think about race and class influences what\nWe hear and if we can really begin to break that automatic assumption [noise] a lot of things can change [noise]\nJennifer Lind stover teaches at Binghamton University she's the author of the sonic color in line and also editor in chief of the sound studies blog sounding out\nSo time to rethink what you consider noise [noise]\nDavid Robin bird hits them thinking about that too [noise]\nNoise traditionally it's just so we don't like\nIt could easily be assailed someone else like [noise]\nElectric guitar makes a really pure so we want to put it into distortion feedback plus functions\nLike noisy but we'd like to see\nThe same thing you find in urban [noise]\nPeople go out and seek the loudest possible places to do so [noise]\nTry and talk loud bars and the quicker if people actually like [noise]\nSometimes we like loud so [noise] sometimes\nNoise other times we actually enjoy [noise]\nA lot of it's our attitude toward what's around us [noise]\nSo what happens if you lean into the noise\nWe'll find out next

P. R. dot org slash programs flash higher ground ideas our producer Judah Sears paw spoke with John over Jonathan Overby about the project\nWhere did the idea for the odyssey series live come from\nWell it's an outgrowth of the Saturday Night broadcast celebrating world music and several years ago and the idea that perhaps there's something more important than just the music perhaps there is a pathway to better understanding the\nDiverse groups that live here in Wisconsin so I determined that it was a music that can help us better understand Wisconsin nights and the diverse community some groups that reside right here in the badger land\nAs you've been looking into this wide heavy found how music and faith and world perspective and and Elise fit together\nWell instead of using the word faith I use the word\nSpiritual and in many cases I use the word sacred because in some traditions what is sacred is not something typically associated with either faith\nOr liturgy or some setting in which people gather a like many of the major religions in the world and so I look at sacred Mrs for example when people gather together to have conversation every day and it becomes part of their ritual\nIt becomes part of celebrating that community and they tell stories and they say ... sing songs and they relate to each other and they talk about how their husbands are off fishing and they've been gone far too long and they wish they were home and perhaps their kids are bad and they're washing clothes and it becomes something that they do every single day of that experience\nDraws them together as a community and so that in my view\nIs very sacred because it's tradition it's at a fine it celebrates that group and that community\nWhat I Love about what you just said is that often when we use the word sacred are here and we think last year we think almost an approachable and what you just described is really the fabric of of the most common shared human experience\nAs well it's the commonalities and unique\nEmbrace of traditions and that can be both there's nothing on sacred about higher deities in this case what I'm proposing and what my research is discovered\nSullivan flawed but much of a very consistent and it says to me the communities that I've visited throughout the world that the deepest\nHeld sentiments about groups all around the globe are found in their sacred traditions spiritual communal\nA ceremonial and of course those things that are rooted in what we term traditional liturgy Z and that is much more encompassing much more celebratory and I think it's out of ... and I think if we look at those elements of how people embrace tradition\nWill find there is a pathway to better understanding each other and I think that's what music does it allows us to hear to grow our ears and to learn more about diverse communities here in Wisconsin in the world\nWe all grow up with a particular ah angle of culture that we are steeped in from birth white traditions like musical expressions of the sacred have you encountered in Wisconsin are around the globe and it really touched you that that are not something that came from your own background in your own experience\nWell that's one of the challenges is that to get out of\nMy own way was it was an issue to set aside my biased interpretations from from the beginning\nTo look at how other people perceive the world life each other those who are different that's part of the challenge and I think that's what's important about understanding people who are different is to see them not as the stranger but as the friend the friend who has\nMany traditions suggest that are followers practitioners should do in some cases\nTheir traditions that say you must welcome the stranger and do it in a way that's wholesome and at a fine and so that is the challenge for all of us to get beyond our own expressions or own traditions how we grew up whether it was in a traditional church or something that people see as the other\nAnd embrace them all in the spirit of good community [noise]\nOf course it's wonderful when we can really like you said do research delve into backgrounds and different um\nConcepts and expressions than we might know ourselves personally but is there also something to be said for when you encounter something of that is different and new to just kind of letting it wash over you and and the kind of feeling it as as something new and exciting\nWell it's okay not to feel it it's okay not to want to endorse it what is not okay is to ignore it or to marginalize it\nSo when you listen to a piece of music you may say oh it's not my favorite style but to have some understanding of what that particular piece of music or the genre of music represents is very very important because what people tend not to understand the marginalized and what they marginalized the often hate and what they hate\nThey turn their back on and in some cases we found tragically they kill so the mission and part of the series\nIs to get beyond the exclusionary ideas that are polarizing nationalism racism gender discrimination seen a phobia trans phobia and religious intolerance to say\nThat if we want to contribute to humanity worldwide we must set aside our hatred we must work to try to better our communities and our nation's by struggling\nTo do away with a disease of hatred and to seek a binding cure and I think that you're in part can be found and sacred traditions associated with music\nI tell you that Jonathan Overby he's host of WPRI the roads to higher ground world music program that airs on Saturday evening from seven to eleven PM I'm WPRI isn't using classical music network and he's with us right now to share information about a new project it's called the odyssey series live\nAnd what are some of the specific topics that you plan to delve into trying to say because these are huge global concepts that we're talking about how are you bringing Dallas to let's\nSee well they're not huge for the community that is being celebrated it may be huge to those who've decided that this is the limit of what they're going to define as sacred\nHowever there is an opportunity when you explore\nTo find the commonalities to look at things that exist in many of the major religions and most of the religions around the world hospitality love respect for the stranger meaning the person who is different\nAnd these elements in many many more exist in most of the world's religious traditions but I also say it must be something that is rooted in good\nIt must be something good rather than an expression that tears down other people that is not part of the focus of the series the series is\nGoing to look at the women in music and how the role of women have helped to change the landscape of music making looking at traditions that were secular moving into a secret traditions we're also going to have some Hindu steady classical music which is very very old and held though that particular tradition and ... and\nOther religions help to define humanity around the globe\nAnd what do you help people who are able to interact with the ... series live will take from this into their own lives and into their own sacred trust\nExtremely important thing to consider but at the root it is about embracing\nSo if you want to have a desire to learn about others\nThen you must meet those people where where they are at in many cases and not assume that they can look different but they must act like\nYou and I act that is not inclusion that is not a celebration for for others and so part of it is to grow our ears to grow our eyes and our sense of what represents good and many traditions there's such a polarizing effective if you don't believe what we believe\nThen you're something very very bad and I think that's dangerous I think it's a disrespect disrespectful and I think we can do much better in our effort to celebrate people around the globe\nSo what are the upcoming odyssey series lies topics and and how can people find out about\nAll they can find out about them on the road to higher ground page at Wisconsin Public radio but the second the series is about women in music women in Eastern Europe who historically have created songs that were popular song secular songs\nAnd they morphed into sacred pieces from secular sacred and in some cases those songs that became sacred went back to being secular and we're going to um have a presentation about that particular area of music and particularly focusing on women who helped to create the world of music\nSo people can find out about upcoming events on to higher ground page they certainly can thank you so much your walk\nIdeas our director Judith fears ... sauce spoke with

focusing on most closely on the Republican side or Susan Collins just like and Lisa Murkowski and I've seen statements from both Susan Collins and Jeff Flake indicating that they appeared satisfied with what they saw in the record\nAnd on the Democratic side I'm Heidi Heitkamp is a\nDemocratic senator from North Dakota\nWho is in a it's a deeply red state and then Joe Manchin the Democratic senator from West Virginia and other deeply red state and Heidi Heitkamp this afternoon came out and said she was going to vote no so um from what I um I understand we still don't know about mansion and Murkowski\n... jobs from from your W white water with the latest on the confirmation process for judge Brett Kavanaugh after this week of FBI some additional investigation claims of sexual assault\nWant to get into some of the the wider issues and other stories going on a related to this on Tuesday of this week at a rally in Mississippi a President Trump a march Christine Blasey Ford the to go to the main and first accuser here's a here's wasn't a part about\nThirty six years was ...\nI had one beer [noise] right I Want to be [noise]\nWell you know I always wonder\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want to I don't know\n[noise]\n[noise] can you talk about the response to a rally including from our Republican senators\n[noise] the the response was the response that we've come to expect I Would say when President Trump does something that is quite out of the ordinary and viewed by many as unacceptable and so we heard\nLindsey Graham say that that was a you know not helpful I'm not sure the exact words to use those three senators that I mentioned earlier just like Lisa Murkowski on both very strongly came out that that this was not\nAppropriate someone on the Republican side use the word appalling and so there was pretty strong reaction but again that's generally what we get from um ... Republican elected officials\nNobody your side uh well because of that we're going to change our vote there is no at least overt statement about changes I mean it's hard\nNo and I haven't heard anything to that but um I've just heard you know the people condemn him or several people condemn them for what they thought with not being helpful in the process and I'm not necessarily being something that not that they would sign on to\nI Want to get into some of the possible political fallout from all those are the mid term elections going on\nA Democrats and a lot of polling had advantages and enthusiasm and generic congressional ballots are we've seen some Senate race polling now showing Republicans doing better than they had previously\nSome Republicans are arguing he all of this a battle over Kavanaugh is going to rally Republican voters in a way that they weren't going to get them out of any kind of a lesser gee they had what are your thoughts on how this could all affect mid term elections\nI think that people are focusing in quite closely honor very recent poll that came out that as you mentioned\nMade the case that Republican enthusiasm with now at a level that was fairly equal to democratic enthusiasm while it hadn't been at that level or maybe a month ago or so and so I think that has some Democrat concern I read an interesting piece this afternoon that that suggested that um perhaps\nThe confirmation process is may then served to energize one party or the other so for example as it's looking um it appears that judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nAnd the thinking might be that than a reaction to that may be to re re energized the Democrats are ... at a a little bit but you know we don't know anything the election is\nUm it it's getting close you know but a lot can happen in a five weeks and so as of right now though there's been a resurgence of Republican energy I Would say\nAnd maybe a short run and a longer term issue is a woman and how they're reacting to ah the day to day what's going on with judge Kavanaugh what we're hearing from President Trump is this something that might expand an already existing gender gap between the parties\nIt it could I mean if you think back to the confirmation hearings with uh Clarence Thomas Anita Hill that was what kicked off the the first year of the woman in Nineteen Ninety to elect an animal already in a period where over the past year year and a half and somewhat data back even twenty election\nThe idea of women being energized and mobilize and I would think that\nSome of what's going on right now at the cabinet nomination and some of the reaction let's say to even the some of the the shift in tone by people\nNow originally there were very respectful of Dr Ford and her um her allegation towards Kevin ... seen that kind of shift and I think that that might have an effect on how women are proceeding certain candidates and my ... are\n... super energize them for November\nWe're getting the latest on the cabinet nomination an investigation Susan Johnson is with us associate professor of political science or you will be white water\nAnd you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four\nWhat should Wisconsin's two senators do they're pretty much committed one way or the other on this but what would you like to see them do when it comes time to vote tomorrow and Saturday on this nomination what do you think of this FBI investigation happening\nOr was it more than was needed was it not enough should Brett Kavanaugh will be the next U.S Supreme court justice call eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four to one two three four or email ideas are WPRI dot org\nWill continue the conversation coming up on central time\nWisconsin Public radio seeks a dynamic development professional and strategic leader to advance a major in plain giving department are striding fundraising program is committed to strategic donor engagement to generate revenue for the stations award winning content\nAnd complete position description for the director of major in plan giving is available at WPRI dot org slash jobs the University of Wisconsin is an equal opportunity employer for best consideration apply by October Eighteenth\nSupporters of Wisconsin Public radio include you W credit union and the Milwaukee symphony orchestra proud sponsors of WPRI programs your business can join our list of contributors more information at WPRI dot org slash sponsor\nSupport also comes from hive on Monroe street a locally owned source for an active outdoor lifestyle was clothing foot where and accessories from Patagonia products and sorrow more is that high of of Madison dot com\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.
