know that there are a lot of poisons growing\nThey got to thinking you know there are a lot of famous stories in history about poisonous land\nSocrates was killed by hand lock and and on and on and I thought it would be interesting to tell those stories not to write a field guide to poisonous laugh\nBut to talk about wind plants have actually killed someone now are being used in warfare or for

killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way the plan is white snake rude poisonous cows\nWould Gray's on this plant the poison would make them sick but also get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness\nAnd it was a real problem\nThroughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting\nIt took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments the KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human\nIt's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and plant\nI read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been listed as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world [laughter]\nWell I thought that I wanted to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get\nYou can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve manned rakes [laughter] they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in the horticulture community\nPlant start getting offered to me kind of secretly like\nYou're actually yes I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plants including some illegal plants\nThere was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband and going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I watched maybe you've heard of a hallucinogenic plan from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the DEA is very aware of and that are losing a gentle plant but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making it creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones that identified what the plant does to you\nMadness or\nBlindness I found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter]\nSo I had all these lightly defective skulls and hands and and so I had those are kind of Ohio like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plants\nSo I was growing Fox glove ... switches heart medication it's a great example if a plant that's both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and it's getting on the which one you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them are very pretty\nI've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have an inability to hate\nI think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and it is something that we're finding out\nKnow Kate is through route exhibits so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract certain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bug that attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so there's certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know it was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nOh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect themselves against predators it's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out to the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is\nMore healthy and superior in some way but strict nine is a hundred percent plant based on what a cyanide so as a rice and\nThey're just trying to keep from getting eaten\nPlants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have foreign\nOr spines are stinging medals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to\nThat was Amy Stewart she

that\nTalking represented my Gallagher incumbent Republican Wisconsin's keep congressional a race\nA representative Gallagher in the news this week us relations with Saudi Arabia house Speaker Paul Ryan said is Saudi Arabia is found to have killed missing Saudi journalist ... Congress would look at new imposing sanctions on the kingdom some your colleagues Republican\nColleagues in the Senate side or even more emphatic about that idea of sanctions is that something you would support doing\nI think it would trigger sanctions under the ... yeah it's a it's a ... or ... didn't stop on the crown prince\nIs taking power he's done a lot of help\nModernize country uh in in the white direction that's for sure but has to be on it ... ballast it is it the first incident that cause for concern out last year there was a kidnapping of the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri the rest of women's rights activist out and get them back that Canada\nOr have been traveling a vast NBS all at the potential to be a transformative leader but he needs to play it than carefully and I don't think we help him and we certainly don't help our moral standing in the world by turning a blind eye to this now I've spent a good deal of my adult life in uniform working in the middle east with our allies and I'll be the first to admit that\nOur allies problematic if they're not perfect oftentimes we don't share their values and we have to work with them on the average people to advance brought her she starts but again the whole point of had to close relationships with such like Saudi Arabia to be able to nudge them in a better direction and a five\nBy a foreign aid or like that it could be the fact about backing from they were behind\nA turning to trade the Trump Administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods as well as those from Mexico Canada ... ... you a looming him and steal foremost among them uh what do you think combat strategy on trade\nWhy didn't you have to distinguish between two lines of effort right there's the so called section real one a trade activity which is getting tough on China I think by and large that it's been\nA long overdue step I think that's a welcome step but it's really China's on Arab areas that are a threat to us that apply to your fears of higher than ours are still not that high things like intellectual property that I'm forced technology transfer\nOther predatory facts that just started but that's been a good story I've been very critical of second line of effort which is the section two thirty ... these are the steel and aluminum tariffs are a couple of reasons one yes you look at the tariffs our allies have ours are higher view across the board on average\nA than you and Canada a second as I I'm really concerned that are farmers\nAre manufacturers of farmers and what's gotten that are going to get caught in the crossfire first thing is even if you disagree with me or if you disagree with the notion that terrorists are taxes to pick winners and losers and distorting the free market is I Believe\nA okay fair enough but a basket on various\nRendered this authority to the executive branch as part of the trade liberal I think as you're and I just don't think it it holds water for the White House executive branch said that we have a national security\nLooming in other countries I think that's strange about that the statute and so I think Congress should be in the business of pulling back some of the story is why introduce legislation that would require Congress to vote on the terrorists\nIf the White House wants to pose than it would be retroactive for two years and again ah you know I have a disagreement with my own party on this that's fine up the constitution divide powers for the very forbid but to me it's clear under the constitution that article on the legislative branch has the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nation\nLet's turn to immigration a long running story in Congress without a lot of action from Congress over the years what would you like to see your twenty nine to\nWell I voted for a pill that I thought you know wasn't perfect but I was still a lot of the problems that would have had broken up\nBorder security and not just a physical barrier wall but also the balance of course it out I was fortunate enough when I was on active duty to spend some time working for the drug enforcement agency spent some time at the southern border doing counter narcotics worth\nBy the fact is order is not secure we have to do it but yeah the fact is that\nIt's not just a matter of border security those people coming in our country illegally are doing it by overstating there'd be says they're not and you know crossing the Rio Grande instead of the night that the more complex issue but I also think you know we have to have a system as flexible enough where if people want to come here legally\nIf they want to be part of this off of American\nGovernment they want to pay their taxes and ... and one day become a citizen then we should say amen that's right that's part of what's made this country great ticket a time when you know we're struggling to find workers area industry the ag industry ... going to find workers so we can do that want the same time saying we should make it difficult if not impossible\nFor people to come here illegally so I just would encourage my colleagues kinda\nG politicized and it's a little bit let let's have a a more open and honest gosh I gotta believe we can fix is aimed at our immigration system it's totally outdated backwards and it's hurting us economic\nUh briefly are your thoughts on health care before we went to go another huge topic\nYeah I'll I'll solving on thirty second\nA healthcare is is a huge issue I mean I I probably hear about that besides what I mentioned before\nMost from people um I haven't worked across the aisle with a a Democrat from Colorado to introduce a bill demanding transparency and pricing from insurance companies hospital because it's my fundamental belief that no matter what you feel about you know the broader question how we find that health insurance\nAnd so we as consumers have health care and so we had patients can decipher our hospital build until we can understand what we're paying for we're never going to get the power back where it should be which is with patients and doctors working together and I said that power will continue to get upwards into big insurance companies\nBig hospital the glamorous and that the complexity that really gets again is ... so I think transparency is the first step I also would like to have a little bit more flexibility to experiment with different delivery system because I Believe you know we're lucky in Wisconsin to have some of the vet\nHelped out some of the country want to preserve what did you think about what Scott and then also have the humility to say that what works for us in Green Bay\nMight be different than what works in Madison or Milwaukee let alone Manhattan or or LA and that's the whole geniuses the laboratories of democracy that what's made our country stronger over the years and so again in Ireland at the highly politicized issue but we need people to work together on\nA fire fighters and things like that at any time you work in close quarters or live in close quarters with people that you have a lot in common with you tend to develop your own in our language and then\nIf you're in an environment where those words can leak and the media or into entertainment or music or what have you and you have a really good chance of you in group language spreading to the larger community\nThe greatest example that I Know of is a roof all and all of the drag race stuff that route does that is incredible they just they find new words they generate knew where they popularized them they just continue to them just the slang machine never stops with a group called and all the people involved with his shows\nHave social media changed the spread of new words sped it up at all\n[noise] Philly has changed to spread the language was always there but now there's a better chance that something new is going to catch on but\nThe other side of that is is that neither chance at quicker champ the better chance that it will burn out\nAnd this may surprise people but a lot of times we stopped using the word because um somebody that we don't really care for it started using it or somebody that we think is in the pool are worthy of respect respect for that or just because we've heard it too often so the burnout cycle to pick up cycle is faster but that burned out cyclists faster to\nTalk of grant Baron from Public Radio's away with words that Sunday Morning at nine I think I said seven earlier Sunday mornings at nine now on the idea is now we're we're talking about\nHow the English language changes now new words come along and grant I also want to talk about a ... old words there's a process that I've seen called ... where people take now to turn them into ... impact or something I act and the impact something I thought grant this was something\nThere's a new fangled the thing that we're doing I dug a little deeper Shakespeare did this a lot like compromise I guess was just a noun until Shakespeare herbicide\nHits so we now verbs referred now we turn to consent to now I'm just surprised people for example do you eat your grains well what are green green up and down a plural now that came from and that you have it\nStates racking call though what do you have a website panels so we this is a really standard way to form words\nIn English changing a part of speeches absolutely ordinary always has been has always been a part of the language I'm not sure why surprises people but it's there and we can track it and Shakespeare it wasn't the first and certainly won't be the law\nAnd people fight back against this there is a backlash and I think impact is a big one it's not the only on why do we push back on these is it right sometimes to push back on these kind of changes\nThere was a necessary fiction there I I tend not to push back that anybody who listens to show no Martha night we have our our preferences but generally kind of ... language do take care of itself because it's it's um it's kind of make up public garden where everybody gets a plot and we all cultivated\nAnd across the whole garden or you can see the larger shift though everyone's doing any of that this year we're there to get a um I think when we push back against the language it's usually because we haven't stopped to think very hard\nAbout who's doing it why they're doing it how often they are doing it wealth is doing it what it means like if you start to gather the data\nAnd think about it like a field the lexicographers somebody out there with a notebook on a tape recorder trying to record the language you'll be into the pattern and you'll begin to recognize that oh it's not just this ... this is how it's done across this whole category of language it's just ordinary and I just happen to find this newest apple\nCan I make a request grand for you and your dictionary type cronies now we've got this gap in the English language I think it's what is the second person plural where if I Want you to one person I see you some old people sometimes you know what I'm Talking about\nYou all you all use all you all those are great substitute can we can we pick one of those in just make it part of the language already\n[laughter] or if not a cat we have one already which decided we don't like it because it off I mean the thing that are yeah who is also a plural um\nWhat we're seeing now is kind of a shakeout where it looks like for example you all becoming more common it is a leading outside of the American south ... than ... than Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania and places like that throughout Pennsylvania is growing love it's some people the the made but the big winner\nThat big winner and this is kind of concern some people is you guys you guys at least in North America in North American English tends to be the the most favored third person all\nInteresting we're talking with a grant Barrett co host of a way with words he's with us to talk about how new words enter the English language whether you want or not and maybe even make their way into your Scrabble dictionary and games\nYou can join in at eight hundred six four
