Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nTo the best of our knowledge I mean strange have\nYou ever go to a museum or gallery and wonder how on earth an artist came up with that\nSo I started playing it shows that are probably about twelve or Thirteen Years ago\nThis is rushing Johnson he's a rising star in contemporary art\nSitting in my bathroom listening to show on National Public radio\nWas a smiley show I mean come on and to be a long long arm swing my bathroom and go ... show shaver got a call from a friend he asked me what I was doing sitting in the past up listening to public radio putting on shade butter butter and they said oh that sounds like a really interesting we're [noise]\nOkay that wouldn't be my reaction but we're talking about how artists work [noise]\nBecause let me think about how carpeted relationship to Africa and a half years it's from West Africa right shape it is what's happening to\nOff and put on a lot of different products that are used today\nYou know drug and in different locations pretty much everybody has put shape better on their skin they just may not realize that everybody's human so they are all using some sort of relationship with the fact that they may not necessarily be aware that they\nWere standing in front of one of Russia's Johnson's Neal is works in a one man show at the Milwaukee art museum it's a long heavy wooden table piled with big sculptural blocks of shape butter\nAnd when you get close you can see that the table itself has been burned places looks almost like a ritual\nIs kind of a ritual experience for both a large portion of the steel brands some of them are kind of like gun sights others are just circles triangles\nUntil the four and a heated almost like a cattle brand and then it burns as to the table so there's a scarring of the scarf vacation of the material and by placing the Shea butter on top of it and he kind of imagine beginning the healing process for this cat and\nSo what began as a private moment in a bathtub turned into a peaceful of historical allusions to slavery colonial trade\nThis is what fascinates me about Rashid Johnson he's always thinking about the complicated relationship so push and pull between individual and collective identity [noise]\nThe biggest piece here actually bond or a room for sides of open black scaffolding spilling tropical glass and park and fun lots of books\nLike we're looking at a gigantic bookcase [laughter] but then with all this lush greenery [noise]\nAnd the plants all from different places so you have a kind of kept us you have homes you have all these different plans from different places kind of living together in a way I think it's almost a metaphor for the collective loss in some ways\nSarcastic and get in there\nThey have the kind of climate and and then they have to kind of force their body up until the middle of the space so it's kind of a trying experience but I think it's more rewarding when you're going to have you gone in there yourself a southerner I spent quite a bit of time inside of the sculpture it's it's a really interesting place to be it feels kind of like a home [laughter]\nSo it's easier for you to write about Nigeria when\nIs easy but it it is the Fords me a certain insight into\nIt knowing it was looking at it from a distance being in Nigeria haven't grown up in Nigeria illuminates my understanding of American even though I'm\nAn American I Want to pick up a little bit on your own personal history your your background because it's it's obviously informed or you're writing\nYou were born in in us right in Michigan if but then quickly your family move it in a few months to like sand you grow up there for for how long how many ... Seventeen years yeah and then came back to America\nAnd then I came back to the U.S back to the mid west back to Kalamazoo for university we had no money very little but they came to the U. S. I got some scholarships I got some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American was Nigerian it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was\nBlack did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black I mean the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the u._s.\nSo when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time you started having those ...\nWell I you know I've been in the U.S for\nA twenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's inevitable but you know within those first couple of years\nThere are many things I did not have a narrative for what does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan and a car slows down the window is one down and someone shouts the N. word at me\nI had to figure out what to think about that\nBut also what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting and somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks\nWhat does that mean you know and all of this stuff has to be understood and you know\nIt took time but my experience of life is as a black person in America or you live in Brooklyn now I live in Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so and you do you consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home\nBecause that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends are there my\nBooks of air so that's how I consider leaders home\nMy parents live there is where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos your by an English language is I'm fluent in so there's an at home this but home is also wherever there's Good Wife by\n[laughter] that sounds [laughter] I'd come next needs of the world in a way that is reduced the ball and as essential to my experience of the world do you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nSplit right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature as a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger allowed\nI'm American and um America is in crisis at the moment\nI feel invested in being an American who with other Americans think about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other\nWhat do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater of war vets my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very Nigerian in that way\nThe most time in our Lycos and New York city or they just two\nTotally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities the commonalities or very similar\nUh it is the experience of calls ... ... which is maybe the ... definition of home from me you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumptions about\nVince conversations that'd be talking about ... if somebody says you know engage should be and\nOr Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how is somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person able to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that's sort of the core value of cosmopolitan and some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us and they are New York is much richer\n... might have twenty five buildings of monumental scale and New York has three hundred never ceases to surprise me the sheer physical scale of\nNew York and then there's that thing in New York of being a world capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't let people in Cairo Johannesburg to tell you different\n[laughter] you know it's all live and they are dogs this is the ... guy talk yeah ... that's\nWhere the pop culture of Africa's been made and sold ... ... the capital of Africa but New York is a couple of the world so that New York is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what does a bolt looked like in these borders\nAre not as they are I loved and actually whiz with a passage from from your book open city which is set in New York kind of a novel\nOf New York and where where you are\nWandering and which is sort of I think ... some of the things that we've been talking about the jury that yes thank you for a bunch of these a book of wandering and what I really wanted to evoke over the course of this book was psychological intensity but also a sense of plenty [noise]\nFirst I encountered the streets of incessant loudness\nShock after the days focus and the relative tranquility as those someone had shatters the calm of a sudden private chapel with a layer of a TV set [noise]\nI was my way through crowds of shoppers and workers to road construction is on the horns of taxes [noise]\nWalking through busy parts of town meant I laid eyes on more people\nAnd I was accustomed to seeing the course of a day\nEach neighborhood of the city appear to be made of a different substance each seemed to have a different era pressure on\nA different psychic weight the bright lights shuttered shops housing projects and luxury hotel\nThe fire escape some city parks\nUsual task of sorting went on\nUntil the forms began to morph into each other [noise]\nAnd assume abstract shapes [noise]\nUnrelated to the real city [noise]\nDid my hectic mind finally show some petty and still itself [noise]\nWith Steve wholesome ... new book is called livestock and you can see some of the photographs in it on our website to teach people dot org where you'll also find a link to a much longer interview Steve did with him in the middle east [laughter]\nSo we're talking this hour about reinventing yourself getting outside boxes or writers have a word for those boxes\nHere's learned mucus with a dangerous idea\nAnd learn because the author of broken monsters and my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether I Am so tired of the very artificial argument that there is literature and they're in science fiction and that there is\nWesterns and crime novels and they these are all somehow different and have different value systems as far as I'm concerned we should be ... you know reading habits we should take any than book we like to bed as long as that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your reader and the bus but you know so the idea that we have stories and we have good stories and bad stories and we have stories that use different elements but to reduce them into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeonholed where they have to set certain criteria it's so frustrating and tedious [noise]\nI think we miss out on a lot of really good books and of course the bad side fire but it also depends on what your idea of science fiction is it's a very broad church it's the same with crime you might have\nAlready tedious it'll murder mystery which breaks out all the cliches about pretty dead girls and the serial killing creeping up on people and we've seen it all before and then you might read a crime novel like on girl which just blows you out of the water\nThese distinctions they're fake they don't exist when he'd mull hybrid novels we need novels which can take their inspiration from the world read what you want to read make yourself happy re challenging adventurous dangerous books across different genres surprised yourself\nAnd I run out there and there's this guy and he's in red spandex and I'm white Mickey Mouse sweatshirt and huge afro and he just hanging on the piano and I'm like ...\nAnd it was late\n[laughter] so do you know had I known years later I'd be idolizing his phone mastery [laughter]\nThey're just doing who you're\nTalking about I've read so much about your past growing up I was thinking about your biography and you're talking about people you're around people that I figure special is the late prince who I Know you were friends and and he was your mentor tell me about about your relationship with him and the music but you were able to do with him\n[noise] yeah well that was just an awesome surprises life [laughter] um I ... you know grown up a huge huge prints fan and he reached out to me on line\nLike Nico will you come to the park and play with us to say yes to that one [laughter] it's pretty much a you know so we went to ... you know that's where the big was\nAnd um yeah I don't know if I meet him I didn't know if he'd be like the wizard of Oz like behind the curtain you know whatever we were sound checking and you know we're in the Paley Park and all of his outfits that you ever remember from ever video where we're we're hanging there and I I can I say the F. word\nSo we were told not to swear but anyhow that's obviously really hard for me so I looked up and I'm like oh shit like that and I and I my eyes go down from looking at the ceiling and don't Barry is I'm like oh my gosh 'cause I was just that she in front of friends but I wasn't\nSo I just kept saying and it was so bad um and then he was like have you ever been to Paisley before and I said no no he's like you want to come check it out yet [laughter]\nSo um I was asking him all kinds of questions and he and he is a super cool and very generous\nAnd then over the years you know we just became friends and he would bring me out on the road and um we wrote together and jammed together and watch movies and he was just very generous with advice and support and\nYeah can you please for me I just I'm sure the song is going to become a hit I Would assume it will I ever want to play the for love or were you do your your cover of princes nothing compares to you for us because [laughter]\nThank you [noise] [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]
