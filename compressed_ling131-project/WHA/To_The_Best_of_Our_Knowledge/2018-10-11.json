remember is that it offers starts the men's liberation\nAuthor of the myth of male power that look was the car taxed the men's rights movement but ... says he never considered the men's movement a backlash\nTo feminism more like a continuation\nThe blessing that the women's movement gave two girls and women was basically saying to two girls but let's say there's a ... you're married and you're both men and women have a a a job and relatively decent job and a woman because pregnant as a woman's has basically to herself I have three options here\nOption one has to be full time involved with my children option to be full time involved with my workplace option three is to do some combination of both the man's is sort of sits back and he says well yeah I have three options to option one has worked fulltime option to his work fulltime option three has worked fulltime\nAnd then if he earns a great deal of money he calls it power but power if you feel obligated to earn money that often somebody else spins while you die sooner I think that's a very efficient definition of power\nAnd there's been no men's movement to help boys question that paradigm\nSo I Want to I Want to bring in the men's rights movement here in and sort of what this is a response to it because you are commonly called the father of the men's rights movement what do you see as the goal here as the value of this movement\nThe men's rights movement and it's sort of current form is like someone who is shouting to be heard for Thirty years and has not been heard\nAnd when people shall to be heard they get hurt they get mean they distort they do anything to get attention and so many people in the men's rights movement are highly intelligent and thoughtful other people in the men's rights movement feel that that women have\nGotten a lot of opportunities that men don't have and that nobody sees the opportunities that men don't have\nAnd we should point out I mean there is a nasty side to all of this or I mean yes and as we as as one reporter is called it you know it's an army of massage innocent trolls on the Internet\nYes well first of all it is in an army of but many of the people in the men's movement are so hurt and such pain\nThat they're shouting out and when people don't get heard as in any relationship they start getting meaner and meaner and angrier and angrier and so if we want to do the best we can is instead of saying trolls or army of let's say what are they trying to say that we are hearing\nWhen the women's movement first surfaced I remember and I was on the board of now in New York City as you know\nI remember being on Barbara Walters showing the today show\nAnd Barbara Walters said well how can you be part of a movement in where you have people like ... who was bisexual this was a number of years ago when this was considered not okay and I said Barbara first of all people who are bisexual may see the heterosexual world more clearly than we do\nWhy don't we open our ears to what the women's movement is saying and instead of calling them dikes and brought burners why don't we hear their best intent\nAnd that led me to spending a good part of my life I'm supporting the women's movement and trying to articulate two men who were feeling threatened by it what the woman's move its best intent was\nWe should just reiterate this point because I mean this is kind of fascinating when you who are so identified with the men's rights movement back in the seventies he worked for the national organization for women you were called the Gloria Steinem of men's liberation I think that's going to surprise a lot of people\nAnd really the the myth of male power was really inspired in many respects by better for dance second book the second major book called the second stage with what she said that we've we've done a great job with women and now we have to focus on men and if we don't focus on men the second stage of the um\nBut there's an underlying reason that we don't listen to to men and that is because part of what toxic masculinity is about is men in order to become successful\nHave to learn to repress their feelings express their feelings\nSo when a man is feeling down and depressed we don't hear about it but he he may act out instead like drinking driving are getting DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI so the question is already being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have I think it's six officers federal offices of women's health we have no offices of men's health even it even though men die sooner\nIf we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women and boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next evolutionary\nMandate [noise] more and Sarah [noise] he's often called the father demands on any route the classic mail power and that was the awesome taught [noise]\n\nYou know boys start getting the message about what it means to be a mom [noise] young [noise]\nSometimes really young\nUncle told me when I was seven years old you're the man of the house you got to take care of your mother and your sister your baby brother like at seven I just want to go play and he told me that I was like what does that mean\nThis is a shanty branch he's a high school teacher and mentor in Oakland, California and when he first started teaching he noticed that a lot of the boys at his school we're kind of checked out they weren't going to class they weren't doing their work and the majority of them weren't graduating\nSo shocked he did something that seemed at first pretty simple he started an after school club for boys\nAnd in that club keep pushed them to take off what he calls the male mask\nYou know the mask is it's a thing that we show the world like when we walk out of our homes to work to school to played most people there are clear that they have a massive they show the world\nAnd so I think that with a lot of young men um does idea like let me just show everybody that I'm happy funny cool athletic intelligent smart how you know whatever the characters that they show and then there's that stuff's sometimes there's like people couldn't handle this stuff people couldn't handle knowing that\nI'm dealing with sadness or fewer depression and also in our society is that a lot of respect for a man Who's Afraid\nWho sad\nSome of our work is helping our young men have a safe place so that they can talk about this stuff is really happening all of it so when they go back to the world they're not like built up all this pressure that's waiting to explode and that's what I think sometime happens we'll let it by young men\nSo for you personally I mean what was the mask you grow up wearing and how did you adopted at what point did you realize it was getting your way\nOh man I was in middle school where there's like a lot of transformation was happening you know I knew that in my head I thought it was kind of smart but in middle school is not cool to be smart\nAnd so am I ... I was like getting sliding by whatever I don't care about those neither do the homework 'cause I didn't want to\nIt wasn't until there's one teacher pulled me aside and really adjusted my thinking you know 'cause I was really I was dealing with a lot of sadness\nYou know my father died before I was born with a prior to about the fact that you're sad every time you see a father like picking up his son some school mhm where you know when you see your father come to back to school at night when you talk to about that like that with my friends couldn't you couldn't talk to them about it so I just had to hold it\nBrewers have their spring training facility and Mary veil Arizona\nAnd this dog just shows up one day out of the blue and you could tell you a dog right stray dog white fluffy ball little thing looks like you had a pretty rough life\nBrewers actually made an effort to try to find the owner of this dog didn't find one so they took him in themselves\nTook him back to Milwaukee and then marketed the heck out of this thing that I made a ton of coin off um and and you know it became a fan favorite\nBut then you just kinda stopped farming or our yeah so the journal sentinel rolled out the story about ... what happened to Hank\nAnd it turns out that he's actually staying with like the the family of a brewer attorney or something laid out of their kids yeah and apparently makes a very rare occasions but he's still kind of there but on an off to the side so hang the dog's still around and probably in a better home than living in a baseball and I would things out\nAnd then the beer now the Miller corps company and that Colorado Milwaukee playoff\nThere's Coors Field in Denver Joe Miller Park they promise free beer to the winter and it's coming it's coming to Milwaukee and I will I'm just letting you right now I'm to be working from Milwaukee tomorrow so don't bother me so bars around Milwaukee you get a mortgage Arnold has a list of bars with free Miller Lite this is central time\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I'm\nA when women or the other women are doing something non traditional and um so I in the previous shows that we did we did one in Iowa City and one in here in Milwaukee their responses war that that is women's fails that represents\nIs on the stage that there's women felt connected there is I'm a ...\nSince I I think that this is the body as the body ages the body becomes a in our in our society on losing is thinking that forgotten and and I think that the\nA senior so where women are working with their bodies with and with their capabilities like chopping was saying pushing our boundaries because you know for me to be on the on the stage tomorrow I had to leave my emails and live all that the strength of words that\nI have to be on the on the on a classroom with my students taking class from one of my peers so when a when we go there and we actually are shared those experiences we're sharing the experiences of pain of happiness\nAlbum of transcendence of watched this body you know and the labels that are within the body can that can can bring\nIn shopping as we start to wrap up I understand these shows are with our cities are officially sold out\nUm I hate to say that I think that there might be some chances are a few seats um they may be obstructed or some people may not show up so please still shots if there is still a shot but I'm excited for the for the um response to to to our show\nIn with that response I wanted to ask you does that mean there's a good chance of a sequel ooh well [laughter] we'll have to talk more about that All right to but to or maybe more performance\nHow did this flooding new season this high rainfall effect you your community your farm your house you name it let us know you can call in right now at eight hundred six four to one two three four hundred\nSix four to one two three four or post on the ideas network Facebook page\nTaught I don't know how long it takes to catch up with these high water levels is there a concern that okay if we end up in the winter with a heavy snow fall season worthy or a levels are so high that can be a problem\nYeah um you know it's hard to say if if the weather pattern will a progress through the winter and necessarily reflect in a snowy or than normal winter but I think one concern we all have is going into the next spring snow melt\nSeason you know one of the factors that always goes into that is where the rivers that what's the saturation level of the soils\nAnd you know we know that we are going to go in to the springs snow melt already with those factors working against us so you know obviously have to see how the winter pans out and how the melt occurs next spring but um yeah you know ... when you go into a winter with high water ready it it certainly is is not a good thing\nLooking back again and there's a heavy rainfall season what's going on up in the atmosphere there that's led to all of this rainy weather\nYou know I Would think the the main factor has been the the kind of stuck weather patterns that we've been in a you know before August twentieth and before that the end of August heavy rain events hit we did have a couple of weeks of a pretty dry weather\nGoing and then the weather pattern took a shift now I don't know of any of us meteorologist out there know exactly why of weather pattern sets up and persists as long as it seems to at times\nBut we went into a ... a warmer and wetter weather pattern that just kept allowing a you know the higher humidity levels that higher moisture values and\nAnd that adds to the fuel for these storms and then when they start to a reform over the same areas like we saw in the Madison Middleton area and in around August twentieth\nEvents they flash flooding a big impact um and then you have sometimes have patterns where it sets up for days like that and that was kind of the end of August and September that we experience and so [noise] um you know just kind of a weather pattern that refused a shift for our luckily like like we've talked about it shifted now to a cold or dryer pattern\nNow we've got some flooding in the news today apparently dilute and I'm not sure if it hits superior to buy a flood it because of high wins on Lake superior is that a store you're watching\nYeah a little bit a National Weather service up in the Duluth areas certainly on top of that but you know there's one other area of the state that that did have a you know from above normal rainfall too and that is a south east of the Ashland area and I'm a southeast of superior\nAnd now with this or is this kind of cold spell this\nThis kind of a false system that just went through ... had brought in a lot of wind with it uh and that's a big impact on the great lakes and so that's a slightly different type of weather phenomenon as this weather pattern kind of shifted but nonetheless they've had their shares of uh impact in the northern and the north one as well\nAs hot as we start to wrap up you mentioned we've got what looks like a dry spell in the short run coming up a water the longer term forecast for the remaining couple of months of the fall\nWell luckily you know it was looking like going in October that it was going to be um I guess above normal precipitation chances kind of near normal temperatures game\nI'm not a lot of signals either way as we go into the I guess the first couple of months of winter outside of a maybe going back to a more of a near normal temperature and precipitation patterns so [noise] you know hopefully just than as as you mentioned earlier than near normal or rain or snow falls don't cause us any uh any more headaches with that\nTodd thanks a lot for joining us today All right thank you and stay safe out there\nI'd say is the warning coordination meteorologist at the national weather service office in La Crosse we talk to them about flooding concerns around Wisconsin after all the rain has gotten over the last couple of
