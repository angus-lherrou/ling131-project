Wisconsin\nNow auto L T Charles and John ring and senior first circus in Iowa as children\nAll\nScrambled out in the house before dawn to me the steamboat carrying and traveling show of the Mississippi River\nThat's part of a new four hour or two part American Experience documentary titled the circus that premieres tonight on Wisconsin Public television and Milwaukee public television at ... pm\nOne of the experts interviewed in the documentary is Wisconsin ... junior use a curator of circus history with the John andme evil ringing museum of art in Sarasota, Florida it's been studying the circus for fifty years Fred\nThanks for joining us it's a pleasure to be with you\nI Want to talk about that excitement in the Eighteen hundreds I'm hearing that the circus is coming to town in an age without the Internet or TV or or college football can you talk about what that felt like\nWell ... was one of the three big days of the year for children in particular and drank right up there with a fourth of July and with Christmas it was a day when white person lived as normal a maybe got loose from your chores you could go watch the circus arriving town see the parade and then go to the show grounds to witness a performance and when you read\nRemarks bottom by people like him one Garland it was just like a day like no other day\nI Want to bring it home to Wisconsin you're joining us from bearable right now tell us how the ring going brothers got into the ... game\nWell it just happened to their family was living here unbearable and they came into exposure with other people who were showman and in the late Eighteen seventies John an hour the oldest ... went into the employer of a fellow named Dr Morrison um Delaware Wisconsin\nAnd they just prospered and grew this idea of owning your own show and in Eighteen eighty two they started with a very modest hall show the play the opera houses around this area and then in Nineteen eighty four either own ability they put together some wagons attempt seating and they took out their very first modest circus\nAnd really there was more uh to be seen from their own hand them from the other performers that they hired but people really recognize right away that these guys had determination they have the skill above all the dedication to making sure that all of their customers had a good experience at their circus\nAnd this gets into a site in touch on I'll leave those are the article but one weird thought I Want to leave quantum mechanics on before and move on the idea that our senses\nIntentionally disguise how complex the universe is so we can do the individual photon because our puny brains couldn't process at all and we got all that information\nYou can handle the truth [laughter]\nThat's exactly it and and basically you know they've done tests where I'm can an organism gauge say the exact amount of water in a pool and\nNo but you can gauge how much water you will allow you to survive in other words you know if the water's too high or going to drown that you can gauge things that are directly relevant\nTo you as an individual surviving and that's basically a physicists think how we process reality so we're not really processing reality we're processing the version that like you said are tiny little brains can handle so tiny brain just blew up with that knowledge but yeah it's a really cool story\nWon't pick my brain up off the floor now and move on and you wrote about a ... this is amazing uh trying to find the DNA of viruses and bacteria to trace the evolution of diseases and this is something up to like literally months ago we didn't know we could do\nAnd you know ... there's been a little work done like I think most people are probably familiar with the genetic history of the um plague\nA pathogen actually being the decoded so now we understand a little bit better how I'm great plagues on such as the black death occurred when I say great I mean huge not great like well yeah but but since then\nA two things have happened in the ... the field of Kelly of pathology and and the folks who the molecular biologist to try to figure out the back story of pathogens and to make things have happened just in the last few months\nOne of them we have this flood of ancient DNA from humans\nThat is actually being put in open access databases that any of these scientists can go and use which is a great great thing so we've got we've gotten better\nAt extracting in sequencing H in DNA or it's now more widely available so the scientists from all over the world can access the actual genomes and data\nAnd there's one more very important piece of the puzzle and that is an explosion in these new software programs that can basically I mean not to bring up quantum mechanics again\nBut they process so much information at again makes\nTo process data that would have been impossible to process even say a year or two ago just because they're able to handle such huge data sets and do them very quickly often in a matter of hours\nAnd so now we're able to go back I don't know how far and look at viruses and bacteria that we couldn't look at the ancestors of today's viruses and bacteria and look at their DNA before\nWell for example um again just a year or so ago having a three hundred year old sample of say hepatitis B was a big deal oh that was great you know three hundred years old can learn something about the past of this particular virus\nWell in may a study came out and they were able to sequence genomes from several truly ancient hepatitis C virus samples including one that was four thousand five hundred years old and I had an interview scheduled with the uh authors\nAnd then all of a sudden another paper came out that sequence a seven thousand year old strain of hepatitis B so you know day by day they're pushing the time clock back further and further in terms of what they can see in these ancient pathogen genome so by the time we finish this interview there probably be an older one out there\nRight this is super interesting enough itself and it sounds like this can help us with the diseases of today 'cause it's useful to know how these things mutate how quickly the of all over generations this could be practical knowledge as well as interesting historical information\nAbsolutely this is huge the study of potential epidemics and outbreaks for two reasons um bacteria and very very trixie things that\nActually steal pieces of DNA from other organisms and incorporate them into their own genomes so they're always evolving very quickly and viruses have this crazy scale to kind of on resurrect big chunks of their genetic passed and basically um become something that they might have been in the past\nThat that makes any sense kind of like a one of the researchers I talked to\nEquate it to an elephant suddenly having a wooly mammoth had\n'em so viruses and bacteria are both really good at using a bits in Bob's of genes from themselves or other organisms to evolve very quickly but by seeing what they were like in the past we can get a much better version\nOf what they might become in the future a much better vision of it and you know hopefully epidemiologist and others can plan for that\nWhether it be developing developing vaccines or early warning systems for epidemics\nSo it's really promising it's not just the history exercise it's very much future focused on tomorrow's medicine\nAre going to jump from discover magazine looking intriguing stories from the world of science so become superstition and a dinosaur let's start with superstition Jemma Packer\nFans superstitions failed this weekend brewer fan supervision succeeded there's a lot of research out there it turns out on I kind of our life stages of superstition what do we know\nYeah and and I just have to say as an aside that I really wanted to watch the brewers games\nOn the last few days I intentionally didn't because whenever I watch uh brewer's game they lose although it yeah you know I I Want you to know that I made the sacrifice for the team a good listening on the radio though which is okay it's it works on the radio it's just if I actually watch it on TV the brewers loose so anyway\nThe aura guy's not gonna be watching the brewers on TV for the foreseeable future if ever but yeah so that kind of thinking I Know even as an saying it that that's totally irrational totally crazy\nDoesn't make sense not real get over it Jemma right but the truth is that there's this period and our childhood we're about four or five until we're about nine I daresay I call it the Santa Claus years and that's\nWhen kids are gonna sign kind of magical thinking or oh that happened it was a miracle or that happened because I did this when there's no link whatsoever\nBecause I'm sure everybody has you know that thing that they do whether it's knocking on wood or carrying a quote unquote lucky charm when you're going for a job interview slipping in your pocket you know so we all do those things and the question is why do we do it\nIt's because we have two different ways of thinking one is very intuitive very fast you jump to conclusions and the other is slower and more deliberate\nSo the slower more deliberate way we think knows it's a rational that there was no connection between what I watch on TV and whether the brewers win or lose I Know that the slow deliberate part of my brain knows that\nBut that fast jump to conclusions part of my thinking is like oh that are not turn on the TV if we want the brewers twin right so basically\nWe develop this kind of dichotomy within our own heads about we know it's a rational but we still knock on wood or do or whatever we're going to do because every time we knock on wood and nothing bad happens or we get the job or whatever\nWe're reinforcing our brains saying oh I knocked on wood and the brewers won or whatever scenario you want to go with\nWhat we should do instead we want to overcome this magical thinking is pay attention to those times we do watch the brewers on envy or we don't knock on wood and we see that the you know bad\nOutcome that we feared doesn't happen and so by reinforcing when you're lucky charm doesn't work or you know when a black cat crosses your path and you get to work just fine anyway that's how you can retrain your brain to get over it is a rational thought\nOn a promise people dinosaur as Jim I Want to get to wrap up new discovery I'll let you lead you must be must be a hobby yeah well thank you I was the name of the dinosaur it's big it's not the biggest but it's a big deal tell us why\nWell it was the biggest of its time and that's back in the early Jurassic you know in the Cretaceous which was after the drastic all the dinosaurs you see in Jurassic Park they were actually pretty much from the Cretaceous but it's just really hard to say Cretaceous park\nSo basically you had to really giant enormous ridiculous sized dinosaurs and the Cretaceous but let him how to use from the Jurassic which came before it so it's a much earlier dinosaur and at the time most of the dinosaurs running around were like the size of a mouse\nMaybe the size of the dog they were not that impressive will do the ... if you can imagine it was twice the size of an African elephant comparatively was big in fact the researchers think this was the biggest dinosaur of its time\nAnd maybe it's not the stage for the development of those are really big guys later on\nActually a challenge is how we thought the really big guys developed later on because\nI'm researchers thought that the really big dinosaurs first developed the stance\nWhere their legs were like columns directly under them to support their weight again like modern elephant and ... is that it was possible to get really big\nWith out that particular posture and without that particular uh anatomy that researchers thought was necessary to wear that much to bear that much weight lifting body actually had very flexible wins and was kind of you know walking around\nYeah I think that the Kavanaugh hearings in particular were real wake up call to a lot of families because they were so polarizing and because so many people heard Dr Ford's testimony and said things like\nI just can't believe it because I Can't believe that she would have had that happen to her and not told her parents and I think that those reactions are intern causing a lot of women or or other victims to say\nBut that's what I did the ad I didn't tell you about it and it's causing it's it's prompting a lot of discussions\nSo what does it say to you about the dynamics of fathered what Deb do how to communicate about not just a fault but maybe about two gender in general\nWell one of the things that I thought was really interesting and this came up in an email after email were daughters who said um\nMy dad I Know he loves me he always told me if anyone tried to hurt me he would kill them and as young women they took that really literally they took that as\nIf I tell my dad about this he will murder my attacker and then he'll go to prison and then it will be my fault and and so I think that there is um that that\nFathers are now rethinking the way that they can be supportive and the way that they can be a comfort to their daughters and maybe the sort of macho field I'll kill anyone who touches my little girl\nIsn't always the best way to be supportive and isn't always the best way to have a dialogue I I also think that we we need to have more open lines of dialogue on it in ways that that relate to gender but don't relate to assault\nUp an example that I brought up is the way that we talk about tampons or the way that we talk about periods and how on and on sitcoms a man having to go buy a pack of ... for his\nThat's shameful and Barry thing like creepy experience and I think that once we open lines of communication about a lot of different things that will also be easier for us to talk about uh about assault\nAnother a theme that came up and ah it from some of your readers and also other we saw on the wide and reports a hash tag on Twitter or was the thought that a father or anyone reporting to ... to judge the survivor the victim uh for being in a situation what might put blame on them\nYeah and I think that that concept especially for women who have heard their dads are their brothers or talk about survivors in general and a particular way so if you've heard your dad to stay\nWell she shouldn't have been wearing that or she shouldn't have been at that party or you know what did she expect that skirt like that\nYou're going to be a lot more reticent to tell your dad about what happened to you because you're gonna wonder why judgments he's going to make about about you and if he's going to immediately ask why you were at that party or why you had a beer or why you were wearing a short skirt\nI you're you're just going to feel like it's not it's not worth it for him to have that perception of you to talk of the\nWashington Post columnist Monica has the about her column dear dads your daughters told me about their

P. R. dot org and monitor you wrote it in another column but are related to this a lot of people thinking back on stories and their own lives and\nMaybe a re interpreting and re thinking or something that they might have dismissed earlier as maybe somebody who had survived that it's there were maybe somebody who perpetrated one\n[noise] yeah I think that there are two ways to process through everything that we are talking about now and and everything that we've had ... that we've experienced in our own lives and one way is to say this isn't that big a deal it happened to me and I got over it or it's not that big a deal it happens all the time when I was young\nAnd and I think that what would be helpful if for us to not ask what has been normal but what should be normal just because these things happen to us when we were younger do we want them to happen to younger people or do we want\nDifferent generations to have higher expectations and to have more open conversations for for what what should happen between two young people\nBut you write in your column but we do and we started off talking about and I'm quoting here for all the stereotypes that linger about women being too fragile or emotional these past weeks revealed what many women are already knew a lot of effort goes into protecting men we love from bad things that happened to us or can you talk more about\n[noise] sure I mean I I think that that's the central\nPoint in the central truth of the column that I'm\nA lot of the the information that came out in the cabinet hearings I'm not not in the hearings themselves but because of the hearings women sharing their stories of assault women sharing their stories of of a bad sexual experiences in high school\nThose stories were not surprising to me and they were not surprising to most women I Know because we have talked about these stories\nAmong ourselves through a really long time he's stay away from so and so when he's had too much to drink he gets Hansi or\nUm you'd be sure to text me when you get to the party be sure to text me when you're leaving the party be sure to text me if you need a ride home the these this is a world that a lot of us have lived in for a really long time\nBut these stories were surprising to a lot of men because they they don't live in that world and because good guys don't realize\nThat women have to live in that world so I think that there it's just been a really eye opening experience for a lot of decent men who haven't ... may be fully fully understood how prevalent these problems are\nA caller who want to remain anonymous and not have a voice on the air so she went through an experience where a priest attempted to assault or she was able to fight 'em off she said because he was well known people said that it was her fault she was the me too movement\nReally has brought back those memories for her this is another a common theme and the wide and report and that just came up in your column to people who did a brings stories to someone else and because it was a a prominent person or a trusted person they weren't believed\nShore and I think that that um\nI mean obviously she she mentions being assaulted by a priest the scandal in the Catholic Church goes back decades and for a long time accusers were afraid that they wouldn't believe people have to just because of\nThe prominent role that their abusers had and and so I think that that is something that we are also grappling with and learning that", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "08"}
