seasonal\nCollection Halloween decorations for the early Nineteen hundreds to the Nineteen fifties he says Halloween used to be for the grown up more than the kids\nFirst this year Wisconsin Public Radio's going beyond the ballot asking people what issues are important to them this election season the state of our roads is one of those issues that gets people talking\nWe've got two stories today that take a look at what people are saying about the state's deteriorating bridges and highway is and where the candidates for governor stand on the issue first here's British about\nEvery corner of Wisconsin we've heard people say the same thing about the reds they need and work in Kenosha there's Rachel Anders narrowed in my area\nI Know it's been brought up something needs to change its causing taxpayers'\nMoney every year to deal with the crowd economy rose I'm sick of that in ... our roads\nEverything seems to be kind of deteriorating\nWe see a lot of tax were going on\nRedmond in Milwaukee I Know there's a lot of funding going on but I don't know why we don't have used to bowl a\nAnd Craig Conan in Green Bay\nRoads around here are horrible it would be available according\nTo an audit of the state department of transportation thirty two point eight percent of Wisconsin state highways or in fair poor or worse condition in two thousand Fifteen it's something Robert swinson from northwestern Wisconsin has seen firsthand\nWillows and Rudy Smith the other day and I think they should probably just flows roads and let you walk because you really in your car driving on him [noise]\nBut there's not ... or just a constant source ... ...\nNot every voter has an opinion about why roads are in bad shape that swinson has a theory in two thousand six a bipartisan coalition repealed a longstanding lot that indexed the gas tax or tied at two inflation ... that was a mistake\nAnd everybody thought is wonderful because we're saving voted for ten dollars a year in our infrastructure to fall apart smart\nGottlieb the former secretary of the state department of transportation is a civil engineer by trade he says roads deteriorate first few reasons\nWater is kind of the enemy of of a pay rent [noise]\nAh so you see that a weather related to those cycles of reasons part deterioration and then you also see I'm deterioration from repeated traffic loading and that's mostly a trucks generally\nBut harsh weather and heavy trucks aside Gottlieb says it's primarily a funding issue in Wisconsin\nWe just don't have enough money to maintain what is a fundamentally a depreciating asset narrowed in a branch they have a specific life span to them and if you aren't making investments you need to make it the right times during that lifespan\nOr bicycle both of which are in business still today\nThey would start cranking out decorations uh not only for the home but for businesses um and people got into it and so if you went to one of those stores you'd buy crepe paper and you might make decorations despite hands are using that crepe paper and\nAs Nineteen Thirteen Nineteen fourteen Nineteen Fifteen comes around those companies started to manufacture\nA party goods invitations place cards or where you sit at a table tally cards who's winning the gangs and all kinds of die cuts which are basically paper cardboard crashed sometimes not trashed\nThat would be hung up on the walls and you go into a house that was decorated for the season and I guess you would feel very festive looking back now with all the decorations that were used back in those early times I can see how that should that would be\nAnd and Halloween material today it's very hard to find from that era meaning from about Nineteen twelve forward to about Nineteen fifty because no one really cared about it they would after the party was over they would just throw everything away a very different than Christmas\nOr where the items that come out at Christmas Time are generally treasured Halloween wasn't treasured at all and so today that uh that lack of care uh translates into true scarcity\nWhat are we going to call her now eight hundred six four to one two three four on is with us and why we got on a low\nUm I\nI go to the the great opportunity to actually see the diabetics firsthand as a child I was born in Seventy eight but a mother grandfather my grandfather my mother's father was born in Nineteen oh poor at his first ... and early thirties and then he had my mother in the fifties fifty one my mother was born\nSo anyway we inherited these hand me downs from generations to generations of these old died at says what the ... or the guest is speaking of uh\nI remember him real vividly colored\nBlack cats in orange ... put little party favors inside of these pets and settlement people's places\nAnd uh I always thought it was just amazing how vivid and beautiful the artwork laws and they were just laid out a paper card court kind of material and I can imagine why they don't live because you don't take care of and they wouldn't last but they were always talk to my mother took down from the Arctic\nIn the around Halloween and she was set around on the table just like they did back in the twenties or thirties or whatever and then a fear always hand maker Halloween costumes we never had anything bought we never went and bought stuff that Dollar General\nAnd when I got to ask her those classic Halloween decorations still around in the family\nOut some are I mean I can remember as a child I think we were little abusive towards them because we didn't understand the value and uh then you know as time went on things got a little bit more fragile and my mother probably put some stuff up that we never got actually look at it but as long as we weren't allowed to touch in and handle things it would look\nHere's easily on thanks a lot for the call and mark yeah there's got to be a lot of attrition in families over the years especially if the kids got to play with some of this stuff absolutely\nYou know children playing with things I tape tackles a all of those things are mortal danger to vantage Halloween collectibles\nOh and thanks for your thanks a lot for that call we're talking about Halloween decorations especially vintage classic ones I'm Mark ... with ... is with us he he collects he's written a book actually about them it's called vintage Halloween collectibles\nYou could joining it eat hundred six word two one two three four if you have some Halloween decorations memories are you a big fan of decorating for Halloween with old or new stuff in the modern day called eight hundred six more two one two three four mark I understand another classic\nYour is the Nineteen thirties or twenties and thirties I guess where we started to import a lot of decorations from Germany\nYeah that's absolutely right the Germans were desperate to make some cash\nOr because of their their World War one activities and they were able to generate some cash by making really wonderful very intricate a holiday decorations not just for Halloween they did every holiday Easter Christmas but Halloween they they they\nMade things called die touch they were heavily embossed crushed out and sold in stores\nAnd some of these die cuts today are that started in the early early twenties and it ended by Nineteen thirty five and that's about Fifteen year period they cranked out\nMany many designed some of which are are what you'd expect a which is I'm black cats owls a few bats here and there and then a few that you wouldn't expect that are just very odd\nUm and those are the ones that were made pretty late in the run Nineteen thirty four Nineteen thirty five today they're quite coveted and and quite valuable uh\nWhat's the one of the more unusual designed\nWell there's a there's a flying in fact dabble child\nAnd there's two of them the father and the sun um you know the father being much much larger than the sun the dice that and those are very very scarce and they go for anywhere depending on condition and condition is always the the big date that you have to successfully\nGo through to to to get the big dollars if if you're somebody wanting to cells condition is paramount but those things sell for anywhere from two thousand four thousand dollars each um\nYeah it's it's all a function of scarcity very few survive like the ... on the color of his mother was a typical that she would keep things and bring things out that's a typical typically people would just throw it away\nAnd um they buy new stuff next year because it was pretty cheap back then\nWe got another caller now will is with us you know Claire Well hi\nGood afternoon gentleman was just a couple of quick ah enjoyable stories about Mars or where there's a growing up in South Bend Indiana couple of callers ago\nA parliamentary that was a murder or family or what they call it costs and same thing with the\nAh we just have a great corners cords going around and come across them from lark lock and I remember one and for her father who is on the east coast thought it would be a great idea if I went as a White House when you're so I was and I almost died and fight it but it\nJust it's a great memory and my wife or the laws are lowering now so let's say that with friends and have a great time it's just a real ... year old or so for instance so\nFantastic well thanks for that I'm Sorry I have you made it to the White House costume and mark is there a collective market for older classic costumes as well as these decorations\nNot really a are sort of yeah they're they're not very um they're they're not collected that I'm sure there's a few people out there that do like them and collect them but in terms of a strong secondary market it does not exist for costumes\nExcept if they were boxed costumes professionally fold and they today they have some relation to a a popular or obscure even television show or movie\nOther than that kind of a entertainment connection um they trick or treat bags and and costumes full are are are just not lived in the secondary markets\nWill thanks for sharing your story mark since you've stumbled into a Halloween collecting about what thirty or so years ago has the market for these items changed over the years [noise]\nYeah it's gotten to the point that the prices or vintage Halloween collectibles in great shape our astronomically high um and and it took a little worrisome in terms of\nThe health of the hobby because it's gotten so expensive I don't see how people who are wanting to begin collecting Halloween can get much of a a a collection together given the prices today\nNow is there a holy grail or I guess for Halloween on holy grail that you wish you had in your collection\nWell there are some German die pets that are a very hard to find that ... had looted by grass for Thirty years so yeah there's a couple of German die cuts that I'd like that but you know I've been collecting a long time and uh I worked hard at building up by collection and so there really aren't\nA whole lot of pieces out there that I I really want a any more there is a Q A and I always hope that maybe you know as I check my email every morning that there's a lead\nOn some of these items but by and large I'm very very pleased with what I've been able to collect\nA over these Thirty years and I sure am glad that I started collecting when I did because prices then we're reasonable and um [noise] you know today's prices are a little less reasonable and it's hard to it's hard to amass a sizable collection\nIn her last a few moments how do you celebrate Halloween yourself\nIn your district if you're a parent a student teacher love to hear from you eight hundred six four to one two three four\nWhat kind of things to now did you hear from people in school district's about what's changed after they made this change down to four days\nYou know I'm for the teacher so they actually said the kids seem to ... um while rest it uh they seem more focused\nThey a notice fewer ... with the children I guess since they get the three day weekend they are not you know calling in sick as much and then also um some of the principles I talked to notice that teacher asked us if it went down to [noise]\nUm now as far as the teachers go they are having to make some adjustments to their schedule for instance if your district is also on Fridays you know some of these teachers aren't likely to test on Monday and uh they're more likely to use that as a refresher day and test on Tuesday because they're thinking oh they just had a three day weekend\nYou know we need to make sure they retain is less refresh them on Monday and test them on Tuesday so there are some schedule adjustment\nAnd how about you wrote a lot about job retention for teachers are people talking about teachers having a you know spend their weekends grading papers and things like that what kind of things did you hear about the schools trying to retain teachers\nAnd and that's a big part of it now these these school districts you know like I said that initial factor as saving money but then they realized wow you know teachers are kind of attracted to this three day weekend and if we can't be salaries that much maybe we can lure them with the promise of a three day weekend\nSo I'm I'm definitely see in a more districts using it as\nA recruiting tool ah just to get the teacher interest and teachers really seemed to like um the three day weekend\nGo to a caller now Amanda is with us and managed to walk Amanda Hi\n\nAmanda higher or what do you think of his idea\nLike\nEight years now and I eat meat in\nAny way [noise] you know we're not we're not going on and you know maybe a little I'm In the ring\nAround me let me let me tell you how are you know reading the\nSo you have friday or Monday I guess whenever native to catch up on ... is that what you're hearing and heard so much\nFor teachers and they said when when they go to this four day school week they finally feel like they have a weekend because so often they spend\nYou know one day out the weekend grading papers are catching up and all of a sudden you look up in your weekend feels like it was one day low with when they have this three day weekend they said they actually feel like even if they do do a little work during the weekend that they still have a weekend\nAmanda thanks a lot for calling in at eight hundred six four to one two three four so now has there been research on how forty week affect a student performance\nYou know that's a great question and hey you know even in ... there's been studies and in talking to a principal and teachers\nThey you know they have not found that um the this compact week\nHas had any kind of negative effect on student learning um some principals report higher test scores because they say the kids just are more rested and they come in fully alert ready to go but they\nI I haven't seen in a you know studies that show the academics suffer [noise] um I haven't heard from any uh principles are teachers that said that either so\nAnd that was always the big concern while academics suffer and that just doesn't seem to be the case\nDid you hear from schools saying okay we did this ... this is a contingency when we can afford this we're just going to go back to the five days a week as soon as we can\nYou know that's the thing about this it is so hard to go back to the five day week after being all four day and\nIt's because that uh you know these families and staffers they just grow attached to having a three day weekend\nI'm now there are there I came across a few districts that did go back to five day wants their financial picture look better because they had made the promise to the community that they would do that but I'm Still even you know one of the principal told me not too long ago she's like\nYou know I'm hearing from families and they said hey we'd rather go back and have those three day weekends again so it's it is kind of hard to move from a a four day once you go to it\nWe're from Nancy on Facebook man the roads that would be too long a day for most children although our working parents supposed to be on a daycare surely we can manage to find money in our budgets for something as important as education you touched on the daycare issue already\nA gifted school they has to be longer or twenty or Ninety minutes or whatever is there a concern that a younger kid that's too long to keep up with all the way\nYes there I mean there there was there's always that concern specially for really young kids and I've\nSeen some of these districts they might you know given extra break or you know kinda rearrange the schedule where maybe they're doing um some of the classes that kids who I find more boring towards the beginning of the day and then maybe saving like the art classes\nOr the gym classes where you know that there ought to be more alert and it's going to wake them up during the ... towards the end of the day so they're they're definitely ... schedule adjustments and\nYou know that that has been a concern to about longer days and that's kinda how district says you know they've kind of raise your schedule to do [noise] maybe the more fun activities or more things that might get kids work site it towards the end of the day keep 'em up\nBring on another caller now Dan is on the line and Racine Dan hello\n[noise] [noise] oh yeah I just wanted to say that I was a kid in Colorado we are the four days a week and actually it was probably the best you're ... years as far as grades went because they're just always felt more with a lot more\nAnd the way they Bush did was they also have that extra days in case there was you know like a snowstorm or stuff like that and they could make it easier\nI just always felt like it was a better shut up for a kid you know you just have that extra day of rest when you were in fact you didn't mind the extra hours already at school\nAnd then can I ask ... if I can get personal here about how long ago were you in school\nOh it's been quite a while which I graduated in eighty nine so this was in the mid eighties\nGotcha Dan thanks a lot for the call and you mentioned Colorado which is a lot of what you cover a ton of are the innovators on forty week\nOh yes they got more than half of their school districts you four day now right\nDan thanks a lot for the call and for sharing your experience\nWe're talking about the growing number of

U. dot org your best interest always comes first\n[laughter]\nListening to central time here on the ideas network on robber and\nComing up the sting of the brewers game seven lost the Dodgers in the land and the national league championship series is probably worn off a little bit coming up we'll let you weigh in with your favorite moments of the season and\nYour hopes for next year and first between now and November sixth of the general election Wisconsin Public Radio's invited candidates who are running in contested races for statewide offices and congressional seats to join us for interviews on central time or the morning show\nYou'll be able to find all of these interviews on Wisconsin vote dot org very we talked to a surrogate loose ski a Democrat running to be Wisconsin state treasurer she's the co founder of the venture capital firm ... partners\nSurrogate Lucy thanks for joining us today Thanks round things for having me I Want to talk about the existence of the office of treasure and past elections we've talked a candidate you wanted to eliminate the office or is this campaign ended voters rejected a constitutional amendment\nYou were working to keep it talk about why you want there to be a state treasurer of Wisconsin\nYeah that's exactly how I got involved in this state treasures races that being in business and finance ride my entire career I was completely a hall that we were going to get rid of our financial officer independently elected financial office that's like\nYou know in my world firing your chief financial officer and firing your auditor in giving those responsibilities to a CEO\nWe would never do that in business so why do we think that would be good government\nAnd on was part of the leaders for that bipartisan fiscal watchdog group and in traveling estate talking about what the state treasurer should or could be doing it just became clear that this office has been neglected for well over a decade\nOn and that's why I decided to throw in Manhattan run for it because I really know it can make a difference for Wisconsin\nNot just neglected but specific task of the streets they treasure have been separated from that office and put elsewhere what you see as the role of the state treasurer given the limited tasks at hand\nThere are three things I Believe this off they should be doing for Wisconsin I it's the first is that this office should be a fiscal watchdog I mean currently in our government the governor and the legislature they tax you\nThey didn't tell you how they're going to spend your money and then they spend your money and they account for it\nThis is like a violation and internal controls and finance one oh one I mean we would net it's kind of like the Fox watching the hen house kind of thing and so what this office should be doing because it has nothing to do with the budget process it has nothing to do with taxation is it should come in and say did your tax dollars were they spent the way that they said they would be and currently that's not happening\nThe second thing that this office should be doing as it should be your financial advocate on do you remember that well when the Wells Fargo kick people off of their loans and raise their interest rates so state treasurer around the country were saying you can't do that to our people and so they literally find to them they canceled financial agreements and in Wisconsin when that happened we did nothing\nHi good die how did you uh did you watch\nIt I watched some of that show and then\nThe last game of thirtieth or this season so I actually seen a lot from the brewers\nFirst Thursday games and the first day of the national it was just\nAny credible such good memories my dad was the lead and that might add so it was it was in with their earlier so um it was just incredible credible for me to see that and set up to ... I take that next year watch out\nI agree\nThank you so much for sharing that at eight hundred six four to one two three four and bill\nOr what what's the season been like for you as a brewers fan this was the most fun season that I can ever remember I mean ... or ... I was one year old when they went to the world series in Nineteen eighty two I kept my memories are little foggy you know personal memories of that one\nBut they've had a couple of they've had a few good years since then most of their years you know we're kind of bad to average at best quite frankly they've really gotten better over the last few years and if you would have told me way back in February that hey the brewers are going to be one went away from going to the world series I would've said\nYou have no idea what you're talking you're creating that's not going to happen\nBut here they are it was such a great ride so many great moments during the season to cheer about um how could you not have a great time to go back to our callers now Jim is with us in bloomer Jim hello\nEd huge brewer fan but what budget is if you're I fortunately did not have a chance to go the whole season but the only thing that I Would change is a I really feel sorry for the guy was\nSupport for WPRI comes from people's food co ops offering co-op basics with purple signs in store grocery staples pantry items vegetables and more committed to getting any budget more at P. F. C. dot co-op\nThree runs on that over on it was very disappointing but you know I I Am not foot in the first down I just really do feel sorry for justice because ah he had struggles and the last two or three weeks for this year boy that really us this stuff\nAnd Jim do you have high hopes for the twenty Nineteen season\nOh huge huge especially with the uh you know the way he started a lot of post season I think it caused a lot of damage the next year or nuclear so we have this place right now I think if you bring everybody back I think we can go further ... World Series all the way\nAll right Jim thanks for the call we're taking your calls about the brewers season one game away from the world series you can join in at eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four to one two three four are you a life long\nMaybe long suffering brewers fan what was this season like for you what was it like watching them in the playoff run and\nDo you have like a gym did high hopes for next year called eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four to one two three four or you can email ideas at WNPR dot org and built talk more about that uh\nMost of these guys are staying put [noise] yeah I was reading an article earlier this morning and I think they only have four\nUnrestricted free agents and none of them are really you know super important core players I think the way to mildly ... or one of their starting pitchers was probably the biggest name on that list\nAnd from what I was reading it looks like Cincinnati may make a play on him because they need a left handed starter and that's where he began his career he was a rookie of the year there went into the American league for a couple of years and just didn't do well then the brewers brought him in and he was he was incredible this year um\nBut other than that yeah everyone is pretty much staying put Les yell at each and Kaine a and Haider and cable Jeffress who our caller mentioned earlier who was unbelievable and the regular season struggled in the postseason but all these guys are coming back and they're starting rotation looks like it could be really good because they've got a lot of young arms in their bullpen\nWho should be starting pitchers and um\nYou know council didn't put them in the bullpen intentionally they just kind of wound up there um so they have a lot of options and yeah I I I read a USA Today column this morning from someone who thought that she would actually be surprised if the brewers didn't make the world series next year so that's pretty bullish\nAnd ah that's got to make it easier to keep a team together too when you're like oh a team in rebuilding year that free agency contract somewhere else might look good your team that's knocking on the door of the world series it's a lot easier to keep people every player wants to win a ring and if you're this close I mean why wouldn't you want to stick around\nRight ... well we our conversation going over at the ideas network a Facebook page want to share a couple of comments there Chris writes just be glad they came disclosed the ride was fun\nA pat right it was a wonderful season we will be back so despite the end of the season bell and got an sometime it didn't end of the world series right this is one that Bruce fans are going to look back on a pretty ... absolutely\nLike I was saying before there were so many years where you know you were just happy if they finished five hundred eighty one eighty one I Know we get to within one game of the world series and obviously you you it it's it was so disappointing to lose that game seven years so close\nAnd now you gotta wait a whole year before the next World Series comes around and and I feel like it's going to take forever for next fall to come around but\nYou know um yeah it it it was also a lot of fun for some\nGood for the cycle twice this year which is not a thing that happens is that without a first ever I think well I think other a very small number of other players have hit for the cycle multiple times I think he was the first player ... single double triple home run exactly in the same game I think she was the first player\nA ticket for the cycle against the same team twice and he did it in about three weeks\nI'm In statistically hitting for the cycle is more rare than a no hitter\nSo this is this is really really rare stuffing Christian yellow just did it twice he'll probably be the national league MVP I'm Josh haters struck out eight guys into into thirds innings against the cardinals back in April I think he was the first player whoever was whoever did that so they just had a lot of great individual performances and of course the team is a whole\nYou know ... that\nThere were a lot of times when we were done talking about the brewers by September ... bring football on\nI'm so glad to ... able to hang onto this for a while and make it interesting talking about the brewers are playoff run you can join and eight hundred six four to one two three four with your thoughts on the season your hopes for the future or chime in on the ideas network Facebook page couple of comments here bell\nI Eric rights well this is a nice thing for those poor folks in LA\nReally have nothing else going for them hopefully this will bring some glimmer of joy in their anti little live now if you'll excuse me I'm going to get a bag of sour balls and pick out the grape one wow and James rights\nSimply go Red Sox you know I was telling my wife that I'm like man I Hope the Dodgers just sweep the red Sox I Hope many Machado go on strikes out sixteen times Kim it's five hours wake you up in the red Sox wipe out the ... yes yes sorry if I got it backwards I was surprised that you know I ... to the extent that I care I Want the red Sox to win this\nUh okay and I'm sure other people will join in over at the ideas network Facebook page or so Nineteen eighty two was that the last time the brewers are in the world series I have this right right it was Nineteen eighty two that's when they were still in the American league and\nUh ... uh\nWhat happened yeah they are in the American league and yeah they ... they lost the St Louis cardinals in game ... right exactly they had beaten the California Angels to go to the world series\nAnd and actually I think it was just a couple of days ago it wasn't actually on Saturday but it was right around that time it had been um like the anniversary of when the brewers got knocked off in that game seven in the world series game so\nUm [noise] yeah it was just kind of a I'm not an animal that\nHopefully next time around we don't have to worry about losing another game seven right now\nOne thing that's been unique about this ... and you're kind of alluding this earlier the paint by numbers pitching a one picture might pitch to weddings or one batter\nAnd one day of right they did that ... and you know you might see five or ... I'm I'm a little old fashioned I think you know can't can't we get starting pitchers that can reliably ghost six innings ... crate councils philosophy is and you look at the the analytics you look at the stance in statistically speaking\nA pitcher's third time through the line up the odds of success begin to favor the hitter and so council just like you know what I'm not immune to deal with that I'm just going to bring in a fresh arm and keep the other team honest\nAnd uh so that's why a lot of the brewery stars weren't going that long and then a couple of times I think I forget which game it was I think it was the last one in Los Angeles so I guess game five he brought wait my Leon\nTo pitch to one batter although no one really thought that was the plan and he put Miley out there so that uh Los Angeles would put more a right handed hitters up a so then he\nPulls Molly out after the first batter brings in a lefty and now all of a sudden or brings in a writer you know all of a sudden the Dodgers lined up is all screwed up because they don't have the right you know a better picture matchups there so that's kind of he's been playing that for most of the last half of the season and it's for the most part it's worked out pretty well for them here coming into twenty nine teams\nI ... I I Can't wait for the season to begin I hate that this season is over but now let's get this next them under way I think they're gonna they're gonna be even better and\nIt it very well may be the ... All right we'll hold you to that Bill thanks ... coming over to the studio I at Central time producer and brewer super fan bill ... thanks for your calls and your comments on the ideas network Facebook page still time for you to chime in there by the way uh what did you think of this season what are you looking forward to in twenty Nineteen\nYeah I mean in the book ... you know I talk about a lot of\nYou know it is for people at different levels levels and their financial life um there are a lot of talk about debt in the book in an option you have if you're really struggling with that because I think it's harder than ever\nTo get out of debt for a lot of people and something that they think they're going to be saddled with forever so you know I think it's important as as personal finance writers and our borders to kind of talk about those options as well because a lot of people really do struggle to get by financially on a day to day basis\nI think a big part of it is um you know side is psychological to\n... you know you can a lotta times you know I've been writing about money for the past five or six years and one thing I always hear people say is why don't they teach the stuff in schools if I just learned this in school that'd be good with money well that's not necessary [laughter] you know financial knowledge is one part of the equation the other part is this is really about your habits in your behavior\nOr some that's a big part of what my book is about is I really talk about the psychology behind why it's hard to understand why it's hard to get personal finance you know\nIt's not just the knowledge you can be you can do all the math and learn all the money rules and learn how four oh one case work but if you don't have control you know have some control over your habits in your behavior in your mind set going to be very difficult to to put that knowledge into practice\nTo say we have the idea okay a budget that sounds like a good thing one of the basics how can we if we are not budgeting now how can we start a budget that we're actually going to keep track of it actually stick with keeping track of for not just a day but weeks well\nOne a kind of controversy on that said a lot of personal finance experts talked about this and one that I interviewed in my book says you know get rid of budgets altogether um have the spending plan instead\nI Will let you in on a secret Rob a budget spending plan are pretty much the same thing but as vending plan is is just that it's a plan for your money and how you're going to use it but with one crucial difference\nIn that you have a goal for it you have something you're working toward whether it's saving you know paying off at ten thousand dollar loans that like I said you could move into a bigger place or you know in my case you could move out of your mother's [laughter]\nUm or maybe it's saving five thousand dollars for an amazing trip to South America was the spending plan you are it's gold based so your goal is the main thing driving all of your financial decisions\nOn and I think just having that you know um you can really help you actually stick to a budget so again when you go to those really tough money decisions where you\nWhere you have a choice of saying yes or no you're going to say yes to your goal so you're going to make better decisions that support you instead of you know you're going to feel like money is working for you instead of the other way around\nAnd you write that one of the obstacles to sticking with a budget or spending plan which are ... and we want to call it is that that impulsive moment and you give some sort of practical advice on how to uh maybe rethink those impulsive purchase decisions can you share a couple with us\nOh yeah I'd love to so that's a big part of sticking to it but just like impulsive spending emotional spending stress spending and I think just understanding the weird ways in which your brain works against you is a big step in the right direction um there are a lot of like cognitive biases that kind of\nAgain weird ways our brain works against us there are a lot of cognitive biases that give them away when it comes to money specifically one of them is the sunk costs fallacy\nAnd with the sun cost fallacy it's basically when you um [noise] you keep making a decision that might not be the right decision because of time or resources money that you've already invested in that decision\nI you know this comes into play with investing a lot but it also comes into play with day to day spending decisions I Will give you a personal example if you are\nUm let's say that you you you have it in your head that you need to go to ... and get you know this little night stand or something you saw on line you drive all the way to ikea you fight for parking you go through their little ah the ... that is ikea\nAnd you discovered they don't have the table you want but you you came all the way you fought for parking you know you have to buy something I don't want to show you know I Can't leave here empty handed so then you spent three hundred dollars and a bunch of stuff that you might not necessarily need and didn't really budget for because of that sunk costs fallacy\nRetarded Christian walk her new book is get money live the life you want not just the life you can afford you can join

I I'm I think I said you know I said like a thousand dollars or something that wasn't a lot but it made me feel like maybe I can do this money thing I have some kind of sense of control over my finances\nUm so I ... I think you know everybody should have something like that\nAs far as when to use it and what not to use it I mean I think there are some things that we inherently kind of know are emergencies and some things that\nUm we think are emergencies but not might not be and I talk about like some really specific examples of this in my book but you know even in in the case of like if your car breaks down you know one question I Would ask is is this something that you need right now could you or is there another\nOption available for you what are your other options for emergency options could you you know take the bus could you take public transportation and maybe the main\nThat but if it's yes then maybe you hold onto your emergency fund while you save up for that car repair or something like that\nSo you know it's not always completely obvious when you shouldn't shouldn't use your emergency fund I think a lot of times people think the rules are very cut and dry like that but I think as long as you're thinking in terms of like\nYou know how what are my other options I'm when I'm In the state of emergency or is this something that I Need to address immediately I Would say any health concerns are usually something you want to address immediately because that might end up costing you more which is another question to ask them for use your emergency fund like if I ignore this problem right now is it going to cost me even more down the road\nIn that case I might want to take care of it now\nYou mentioned your emergency fund giving you a feeling of control and you write that some people look at the overall economy a student loan debt up a lot of things are beyond people's control\n... year at Wisconsin Public radio is going beyond the ... we want to know what issues are important to you this election Sandra from telling me that she wants health care to be more affordable\nI'm an enormous workers so I see a lot of people that are making decisions about whether to buy drugs that they need or whether they have the right\nTo see the stories board is sharing around they WPRI dot org slash\nAudi often PBS Kids shows that children are now available twenty four hours a day and then I got the money for men and channel\nWhenever and wherever they are children and you're in line my educational television coming in there for you that trades watch over the air or humid free time anywhere\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Rob parents you're with us here on the ideas that were coming up we've learned from past shows that a lot of you like to collect things we'll hear from a guest with unique and seasonal collection Halloween decorations for the early Nineteen hundreds to the Nineteen fifties he says Halloween used to be for the grown up more than the kids\nFirst this year Wisconsin Public Radio's going beyond the ballot asking people what issues are important to them this election season the state of our roads is one\nOf those issues that gets people talking we've got two stories today that take a look at what people are saying about the state's deteriorating bridges and highways and where the candidates for governor stand on the issue first here's British about\nEvery corner of Wisconsin we've heard people say the same thing about the reds they need work in Kenosha there's Rachel understand\nThe roads in my area are horrible horrible horrible and I know it's been brought up something needs to change its founding taxpayers\nOf money every year to deal with the crime economy roads I'm sick of that in ... our roads\nEverything seems to be kind of ...\nWe see a lot of ... where it's going on\nRedmond in Milwaukee I Know there's a lot of funding going on but I don't know why we don't have used to bowl a\nAnd Craig Conan in Green Bay roads around here are horrible\nOf transportation thirty two point eight percent of Wisconsin state highways or in fair poor or worse condition in two thousand fifteenth it's something Robert swinson from northwestern Wisconsin has seen first hand\nWhile I was in ... the other day and I think they should probably just flows them roads and let you walk because you really are car driving on um [noise]\nThere's not potholes you're just a constant\nSource of ... and ... and ... says\nEvery voter has an opinion about why roads are in bad shape at swinson has a theory in two thousand six a bipartisan coalition repealed a longstanding lot that indexed the gas tax or tied at two inflation ... thanks that was a mistake\nAnd everybody thought it was wonderful because we were saving for ten dollars a year and now we're in Pittsburgh to fall apart smart\nGottlieb the former secretary of the state department of transportation is a civil engineer by trade he says roads deteriorate first few reasons\nWater is kind of the enemy of pavement [noise] ah so you see that a weather related those cycles of reasons part deterioration and then you also see I'm deterioration from repeated traffic loading and that's mostly\nBoth of which are in business still today they would start cranking out decorations are not only for the home but for businesses\nAnd so if you went to one of those stores you'd buy crepe paper and you might make decorations just by hands are using that crepe paper and as Nineteen Thirteen Nineteen fourteen Nineteen Thirteen comes around those companies started to manufacture\nA party Goodrich invitations place cards out where you sit at a table tally cards who's winning the gangs\nAnd all kinds of diets cuts which are basically paper cardboard crashed\nSometimes not trashed that would be hung up on the walls and you go into a house that was decorated for the season and\nI guess you would feel very festive looking back now with all the decorations that were used back in those early times I can see how that should that would be and and Halloween material today it's very hard to find from that era meaning from\nAbout Nineteen twelve forward to about Nineteen fifty because no one really cared about it they would after the party was over they would just throw everything away a very different than Christmas\nOr where the items that come out at Christmas Time are generally treasured Halloween wasn't treasured at all and so today that uh that lack of care uh translates into truth scarcity\nOr to bring a caller now eight hundred six four to one two three four Owen is with us in why we got on hello\nYeah I'm I I the the the great opportunity to actually see the dye packs firsthand as a child I was born in Seventy eight but a mother grandfather my grandfather my mother's father was born in Nineteen oh poor cat his first ... and early thirties and then he had my mother starting in the fifties\nFifty one my mother was born [laughter] so anyway we inherited these hand me downs from generations\nTo generations of these old died at says what the caller the\nGet this speaking of uh\nI remember him real vividly colored\nBlack cats in orange ... put little party favors inside of these pets and settlement people's places\nAnd uh I always thought it was just amazing how vivid and beautiful the artwork laws and they were just lay out a paper card court kind of material and I can imagine why they don't live because you don't take care of and they wouldn't do that but they were always come to my mother took down from the Arctic\nAround Halloween and she was set around on the table just like they did back in the\nTwenties or thirties or whatever and then a fear always hand maker Halloween costumes we never had anything bought we never went and bought stuff that Dollar General\nAnd when I got to ask are those are classic Halloween decorations still around in the family so\nYeah so am I I mean I can remember as a child I think we're we're a little ... towards them because we didn't understand the value and uh then you know it's time went on things got a little bit more fragile and my mother probably put some stuff up that we never got actually look at but\nAs

cats owls a few bats here in there and then a few that you wouldn't expect that are just very odd\nUm and those are the ones that were made pretty late in the run Nineteen thirty four Nineteen thirty five today they're quite coveted and and quite valuable uh\nWhat's the one of the more unusual designed\nWell there's a a they're safe flying in fact dabble childs\nAnd there's two of them the father and son um you know the father being much much larger than the sun the dice has and those are very very scares them they go for anywhere depending on condition and condition is always the the big gate

afternoon gentleman just a couple of quick uh enjoyable story about my childhood as a growing up in South Bend Indiana couple of callers ago\nA poll mentioned that was a murder or family or what they call the cops and the thing with the\nUm ... great corners quiz going around and telling me it's a cross him some luck luck and I remember one in ... her father who is in the east coast thought it would be a great idea if I went as a light health when you're so I you know and I almost\nDied and fight it but I couldn't breathe for ... you know\nThere was this is a great memory when my wife or your loved ... friends and have a great time it's just a real ... year old or so for instance so\nFantastic well thanks for that I'm Sorry I have you made it to the White House ... to ... and mark is there a collective market for older classic costumes as well as these decorations\nReally a A R sort of yeah they're they're not very um they're they're not collected that I'm sure there's a few people out there that do like them and collect them but in terms of a strong secondary market it does not exist for costumes except if they were boxed costumes professionally fold\nAnd they today they have some relation to a a a popular or obscure even\nOther than that kind of a entertainment connection um date trick or treat bags and and costumes fall are are are just not lived in the checking dairy market\nWill thanks for sharing your story mark since you've stumbled into a Halloween fact collecting about what thirty or so years ago has the market for these items changed over the years [noise]\nYeah it's gotten to the point that the prices for vintage Halloween collectibles in great shape our astronomically high um and and it took a little worrisome in terms of the health of the hobby because it's gotten so expensive I don't see how\nPeople who are wanting to begin collecting Halloween can get much of a a a collection together given the prices today\nNow is there a holy grail or I guess for Halloween ... holy grail that you wish you had in your collection\nWell there are some German die pets that are a very hard to find that ... had limited by grass for Thirty years so yeah there's a couple of German die cuts that I like that but you know I've been collecting a long time and uh I work hard at building up my collection and so there really aren't\nA whole lot of pieces out there that I I really want\nA anymore there's a few uh and I always hope that maybe you know as I check my email every morning that there's a lead on some of these items but by and large I'm very very pleased with what I've been able to collect\nA over these Thirty years and I sure am glad that I started collecting when I did because prices then we're reasonable and um [noise] you know today's prices are a little less reasonable and it's hard to it's hard to amass a sizable collection\nAnd our last a just a few moments how do you celebrate Halloween yourself\nIn your district if you're a parent a student teacher love to hear from you eight hundred six four to one two three four\nWhat kind of things to now did you hear from people in school district's about what's changed after they made this change down to four days\nYou know I'm for the teacher that they actually said the kids seem to a wall rest it uh they seem more focused\nThey a notice fewer ... with the children I guess since they get the three day weekend they are not you know call in sick as much and then also um some of the principles I talked to notice that teacher asked us instead went down to [noise]\nUm now as far as the teachers go they are having to make some adjustments to their schedule for instance if your district is also in friday's you know some of these teachers are likely to test on Monday\nAnd uh they're more likely to use that as a refresher day and test on Tuesday because they're thinking oh they just had a three day weekend\nYou know we need to make sure they retain is less refresh them on Monday and then test them on Tuesday so there are some schedule adjustment\nAnd how about you wrote a lot about job retention for teachers are people talking about teachers having a you know spend their weekends grading papers and things like that what kind of things did you hear about the school is trying to retain teachers\nAnd and that's a big part of it now these these school districts you know like I said the initial factor a saving money but then they realized wow you know teachers are kind of attracted to this three day weekend and if we\nCan't be salaries that much maybe we can lure them with the promise of a three day weekend so I'm\nI'm definitely see in a more districts using it as a recruiting tool ah just to get the teacher interest and teachers really seemed to like um the three day weekend\nGo to a caller now Amanda is with us and managed to walk Amanda Hi\nAmanda hired or what do you think of his idea\nTo me like\nYou're right now and I eat meat in\nAny way [noise] you know we're not we're going on [noise] and you know maybe a little time in the ring\nAround me let me let me ask you how are you know reading the\nAmount of thanks for the call so Amanda saying she could see that uh you know that you have friday or Monday I guess which every day to catch up on ... is that what you're hearing and just as\nMuch from teachers and they said when when they go to this four day school week they finally feel like they have a weekend because so often they spend you know one day out the weekend grading papers are catching up and all of a sudden you look up in your weekend feels like it was one day low with when they have this three day weekend\nThey said they actually feel like even if they do do a little work during the weekend that they still have a weekend\nAmanda thanks for calling in an eight hundred six four to one two three four son out has there been research on how four day week affect a student performance\n[laughter] that's a great question and hey you know even in there\nTeachers they you know they have not found that\nUm the the compact week has had any kind of negative effect on student learning um some principals report higher test scores you know they say that kid just are more rest it and they come in fully alert ready to go but they\nHaven't seen in a ... you know studies that show the academics suffer [noise]\nUm I haven't heard from any uh principles are teachers that said that either so [laughter] and that was always the big concern while academics suffer and that just doesn't seem to be the case\nDid you hear from school saying okay we did this for costs this is a contingency when we can afford this we're just going to go back to the five days a week as soon as we can\nYou know that's the thing about this it is so hard to come back to the five day week after being all four day and it's because that uh you know these families and staffers they just grow attached to having a three day weekend\nI'm now there are there I came across as she districts that did go back to five day wants their financial picture look better because they had made the promise to the community that they would do that\nBut I'm Still even you know one of the principal told me not too long ago she's like you know I'm hearing from families on they said hey we'd rather go back and have those three day weekends again so I it's it's kind of hard to move from a a four day once you go to it\nWe're from Nancy on Facebook man the roads that would be too long a day for most children also our working parents supposed to manage daycare surely we can manage to find money in our budgets for something as important as education you touched on the daycare issue already\nA gifted school they have to be longer or twenty or Ninety minutes or whatever is there a concern that are associated with younger kids that's too long to keep up with all the way\nYes there I mean there there was there's always that concern especially for really young kids and I've seen some of these districts they might you know given extra break or you know kinda rearrange the schedule where maybe they're doing um\nSome of the classes that kids who I find more boring towards the beginning of the day\nAnd then maybe saving like the art classes at the gym classes where you know that's got to be more alert and it's going to wake them up during the ... towards the end of the day so they're they're definitely are scheduled adjustments and you know that that has been a concern to about longer days and that's kinda how district says you know they've kind of veered raise your schedule to do [noise]\nMaybe the more fun activities are more things that might get kids work site it towards the end of the day keep 'em up\nBring on another caller now Dan is on the line and Racine Dan hello\n[noise] [noise] well yeah I just wanted to say that I was a kid in Colorado we are the four days a week and actually it was probably the best you're ... years\nAs far as grades went because I just always felt more with a lot more relaxed\nCome the day of school and the way they Bush did was they also have extra days in case there was you know like a snowstorm or stuff like that and they could make it easier\nI just always felt like it was a better set up for a kid you know you just have that extra day Greste when you went back you didn't mind that extra hours you were already at school\nAnd then can I ask ... if I can get personal here about how long ago were you in school\nOh it's been quite a while which I
