allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nDemocratic representative Keith Ellison Minnesota is campaigning it'd be the state's attorney general despite claims of domestic violence plus both President Trump and the chair of the Federal Reserve are praising the state of the U.S economy something that would normally be a big plus for Republicans on the campaign trail\nYou can weigh in on our question of the week is the health of the economy a major voting issue for you if you're a Republican you wish you all the candidates would focus more on the current economy than they do\nYour vote or do you think the political polarization is maybe issues like the economy took a backseat to more negative or messaging attack ads Colin hundred six four to one two three four that three hundred six four to one two three four email ideas of WPRI dot org\nAmanda Terkel joins us now Washington bureau chief for the Huffington Post Amanda welcome back to central time\nThanks for having me well one of the big stories people were following the FBI apparently wrapping up pretty soon this investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh lot of confusion this week over the scope of the investigation who's going to be interviewed and who's not what do we know and I just not know about this up your investigation well\nIt looks like that as of now Christine's lousy Ford and Brett Kavanaugh are the two main players in this are not going\nTo be interviewed by the FBI I'm at the request of the White House and a\nFord has said that she wants to be interviewed actually just a few minutes before our conversation her legal team uh sent out a letter ah responding to a request for some documents and said we're happy to provide them but she wants to be interviewed by the FBI\nAfter all she was one of the people who requested the FBI investigation uh\n... you know Republicans have said that there is no need to talk to them because they have already testified before the Senate Judiciary committee they should have told the committee everything and the White House said like look if senators have more questions for them they should have asked they had their chance to ask them but they are interviewing people who are supposedly\nA witness as people like Mark judge you Christine Blasey Ford said was present during a\nHer sexual assault by Kevin up but it seems like there are a lot more people out there who say they have information that could\nAh corroborate afford the allegations are maybe help cabin up but it doesn't seem like the FBI's investigation is going to get everyone\nYou wrote a recent piece looking at an FBI investigation and harassment claims by Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation back in Nineteen Ninety One a how to the results of that investigation of factor into the confirmation process\nUh extension is making permanent on those individual tax cuts as you said the Senate or the ... they're going to pick that up at all is this an opportunity to do for Republicans to run on see we we pass your individual tax cuts and to put Democrats on the spot voting for for or against them\n[noise] I think that's what they're hoping that's obviously why they passed it um but\nAgain I think that Democrats have a pretty easy\nFor a bottle of all why didn't he do that to begin with um dispel isn't going to go anywhere you know why were they looking out for corporations and they'd only worry about passing your tax cuts and making them permanent later in this individual belt which is harder to pass\nSo you know again from what I've seen Republicans there have been some Republicans talking about the tax legislation but overall it's just not something they're running on\nA they just know it's it's not popular so when they do talk about taxes it's much Baker about Democrats not supporting tax cuts are wanting to raise your taxes um ... you know there are issues that the public feels very strongly about this election cycle health care is very very high on the list\nRepublicans for years ran on\nRepealing Obamacare and this is the first cycles since Obamacare passed that Democrats are running more ads on it because Obamacare has gotten more popular and people don't want to see it repealed but that's not what's driving people to the polls just as people may like tax cuts up but it's not\nDriving them to polls it's this ... sort of a larger issue\nOf the political atmosphere sort of how they feel\nAbout their candidates in Trump and and the general political\nI'm sort of just the general political atmosphere I'd say more than ... individual issues and the change they want to see in the country\nWant to take one more call on the politics of the economy Dan is with us ... down hello\nHow are you good what do you think\nWell I think that while you're caller do for your guest does have some salad or if they were ... with a rather large rush are saying that only corporations are able to big corporations Betty companies that are regulated as the one hundred and five other employers race\nGot those tax bridge at our age where they have reduced the unemployment rate in not losing business or losing customers but by and expanding their operations to the point where are the employment rate is that's the lowest level it's this is years the other thing is to say that you know\nWages are stagnant well that's also not really accurate because there are a J. or other numbers all sort of wages are rising\nSo rising up for re everybody would like probably not for going backwards ... inflation those are things that have been avoided voters foot\nDown thanks a lot for the call Dan pointing to the good news is easy and Republicans I mean the unemployment number alone or something that Republicans could be or it could be trying to run on [noise]\nAnd a traditional election they definitely would be but it's still it's still the fact that a lot of people aren't seeing their wages and their quality of life change as dramatically as Trump a surge trumpet when he is on the campaign trail um you know Democrats also when they talk about\nDeficit created by it and sort of warning that Republicans are going to a target cuts in Social Security and Medicare to pay for it\nUm you know this is especially because Republicans for so long talk that sort of ... Democrats for not paying enough attention at reducing the deficit\nIt's just you know like I said in this election cycle the economy and the state of the economy and as much as Trump wants to take credit for it it it's just not the driving issue and it's not enough to motivate people to get out to the polls necessarily\nThanks for the call Dan we're talking to a mandatory goal from the Huffington Post and get some of the big issues of national politics one move on to a couple of other stories now I Want to it's going to national angle and relevant to our neighbors to the west and Minnesota where you're from us representative Keith Ellison a Democrat running for attorney general in Minnesota\nHas been under investigation by the attorney hired by the Democratic party in that state uh prohibitions of domestic abuse can you bring us up to date on that store\nSure well I mean it's it's really hurting Allison's reelection bed at ... Congressman Ellison a sort of a rising star in the Democratic party this progressive superstar and he's running for attorney general but he has this domestic abuse allegation hanging over him and the party hired\nSomeone to independently look at it and she found that sort of the most sort of the most uh\nThe biggest allegation in there that he started dragged her a off their bed while shouting profanity at her and twenty six team that that just couldn't be substantiated other woman carrying Monaghan a\nAn ex girlfriend of Keith Ellison said that she has video but she hasn't produced and she said it keeps changing\nA explanations for why but there are still questions of whether you know in that relationship there was maybe emotional abuse verbal abuse things like that so you know the the the report sort of a\nHim out of the worst allegation and said that there just wasn't enough evidence for it but it's still hanging over him and that sort of me too movement and it's still something that his Republican colleagues are using against him and that makes many Democrats uneasy with his candidacy\nAnd the president former President Obama had released a bunch of new uh ... and races around the country David this is one he did not issue an endorsement are noticeably\nWhich is surprising you know in any I mean people are very excited when it when Keith Ellison said that he was going to be running for attorney general right now attorney general around the country are sort of at the front edge of\nA hitting back at President Trump Keith Ellison is no was known as a congressman as being incredibly aggressive outspoken a progressive champion and so this seems like a good role for him somewhere where he could maybe do a little bit more than being in Congress a\nBut now it's just you know Democrats are not only worried about his candidacy and losing the attorney general seat to a Republican but what if he could have on the other candidates\nAnd I want to turn to go to a more abstract notion of the pace of national news lately Amanda was it just two or three weeks ago we were all trying to figure out who wrote the anonymous op ed ministry official Bob Woodward book was the the game changer that we're all going to be talking about for weeks and months to come\nNow so many other things have happened since then of course the Calvin are confirmation President Trump's comments yesterday or this New York times that we haven't even talked about on Donald Trump's for natural history a one story crowds on another story really fast lately\nYeah I mean honestly I completely forgot about that and not have it in New York Times ... how could [laughter] and how every reporter was supposed to be spending their time trying to uh\nBut I mean it's just crazy in any other administration I feel like one of these stories would just be a giant scandal or or what President Trump said about the debt because of the hurricane in Puerto Rico you know any other\n... that would just be such a big scandal and now we've all moved on from it and so Trump in many ways it's sort of benefiting from the chaos and the constant churning news cycle of the the news about what's going on bet people can't keep their attention in one place\nI Can't really dig in on one thing but the cabinet things seems like it's going to be taking her out of the Republicans are trying to push through as quickly as possible\nBut does it feel like in reporting on Congress and national politics but do you get a sense to be with your reporting about are feeling the sense of of chaos of this fast moving train of events\nOh absolutely I mean you infrequently ask lawmakers on Capitol Hill about something and they're like I haven't even seen it yet or they sort of roll their eyes and they're like I Can't keep up with that I mean\nYou know I mean senators at especially don't really like dealing with all the cast coming out of the White House because then they're asked by reporters respond to it and it's not necessarily what\nThey want to be dealing with either I'm sure they would much love to be talking about the tax bill and the economy and things like that and what they have going on in Congress but instead they have to respond to the president's tweets or something he said that rally so it it's completely in Washington is just very different was during the Obama and Bush years\nIs there a sense that uh this is how it's going to be forever or is this maybe how it's going to be during the Trump Administration however long that might laugh the other two or six years whatever\nDefinitely during the Trump peers whether this continues a that is a big question that everyone wonders and I don't know maybe might depend on who the next president is\nAll right we'll leave it there for now Amanda thanks as always for joining us today\nThank you we would talk to a mandatory goals she's the Washington bureau chief for the Huffington Post she was with us for a look at some of the week's top political news so time for you to weigh in on our question this week how important is the economy for you as an issue in the November midterm elections\nYou can tweet us at Central time at WNPR you can always tweet us at Central time WPRI you can also email ideas at W. P. R. dot org let us know what you think\n[noise] coming up after the news the great lakes compact was signed into law a decade ago today we'll talk about the original push behind that law and the challenges it's based in two thousand and aid including some new information about a major water diversion plan that was approved\nBack in twenty term but stayed under the radar in many ways since then our guest tells us about that I've also look at the Foxconn water diversion story the long saga in walkers saw him more\nAnd the region near the governor's office in Michigan said it's going to be reviewing things and so I end the news is just a couple a couple of weeks old since the book or first came out and so that everyone still processing it but it's it's I think we're going to hear a little bit more about pleasant prairie going forward\nIt will be watching for developments let's take a step back now to talk about the compact more generally what was the main goal of the great lakes compact yeah so for\nDecades and decades there has been a fear that is the\nWater situation in the United states and globally becomes more and more stressed that there'll be increased global regional continental pressure on water rich regions of the world like the north American great way so the compact was designed\nAs what I call legal water fence to keep Great Lakes water inside the great lakes basin so that the the the jobs come to the water rather than sending the water to the job somewhere else agriculture cities et cetera\nAnd how far can we take water out of the great lakes and there's a there's some little gray areas that that the ... story is part of that but how much is is diversion limited\nYeah so there are two key exception clauses and the great lakes compact\nAnd those are accepting clauses for communities that straddles sit right on top of that Great Lakes basin line that soup bowl rim of\nA watershed that surrounds the the five North American Great Lakes and then there's also a straddling county exception clause for communities that are in counties that straddled the base in line with the communities communities themselves are clean and clear outside the great lakes basin\nAnd so those straddling county applicants which is what Walker Shaw was\nHave a much higher bar a dentist into straddling community applicants which is an example would be new Berlin outside of Milwaukee\nOr is that the straddling community applicants only the approval of the local state but walk the shah and other straddling county applicants need the approval of all eight Great Lakes governors ah which is a super high bar called approval from Minnesota to New York\nTalking to Peter Annan author of the great lakes water wars about the great lakes compact on the tenth anniversary of of it being signed into law and\nA diversion efforts that have gone on to the last ten years and those are the future to beat her one that's got a lot of attention you already mentioned it earlier is uh the Foxconn this huge a corporate say dust real development ah with its own diversion request can you put that in the context of the great lakes compact\nAnd and the Foxconn proposed to really also was surprising to a lot of people because the authors of the compact and told me that they they didn't really envision\nFacility actually straddling the great lakes basin line so we talked about straddling communities we've talked about straddling county is the Foxconn situation brought up a straddling corporation that literally\nThe the the facility which is going to be the size of three Pentagon is sort of partially inside the great lakes watershed and partially out of it\nBecause it's partially out of it it required a was needed a ... a wad of diversion application is located in the community of Mount Pleasant which is just west of or seen Mount Pleasant doesn't have its own water supply system it gets his water from Racine\nThereby Racine applies for the water diversion on behalf of Mount Pleasant which is in part and playing on behalf of applying on behalf of Foxconn\nAnd so that sort of stir things up and new ways because there's a debate going on and a legal challenge now which was filed in may\nYou know asking the question whether or not a water was meant to be diverted for corporations and because there is language and the compact that says the water really as for public water supply purposes primarily residential in nature\nNow we hear about the volume of water that goes to some of these projects were talking about and you know millions of gallons which sounds like a lot does a diversion like the ... one of the Foxconn plant compared to the volume of the great lakes do they really make that much of a difference yeah it's it\nThey do not and you're right those those numbers sound like they're big you know seven eight million gallons per day\nUm but you know if you have six ... billion gallons and the great lakes which is the number is so large is hard for people to wrap their head around it but these diversions we are talking about would really be in measurable if somebody tried to measure the impact that they would have on the great lakes and it's important to remember\nThat one of the key changes that the great lakes and brought the great lakes compact brought to the water diversion debate is that it requires that this water all the return to the great lakes after it's clean the clean Water Act standards\nAnd and um and discharged uh to to the water bodies so that idea to be really known that loss under these water diversions and but but throughout the history of the great lakes water diversion debate and concern it's never really bad about any one water diversion\nCreating damaging it of itself to the great lakes water levels it's the fact that there could be precedent that could be set that could sort of lead to sort of a a death or destruction by a thousand straws if you will that there's some kind of camel's nose gets in\nA into the process and then it creates a legal precedent by which could be expanded by future diversions et cetera et cetera et cetera but again\nThe great lakes compact with this you know to just only allowing water diversions all of which have to be returned for communities on or near the great lakes basin line really rein things in it because if you're not a community that's on the base in line or just outside and\nYou can't even request a Great Lakes water diversion so they're lake's really have never before been better protected and what we see after ten years of the great lakes compact is you know we're working into new areas the documents being tested the legal mechanism as being Texas Tech tested\nAnd it's you know it's like I didn't look at a conference at Marquette University of ... refer to it as a ten year old child that's not even a teenager yet and it's normal for these complex environmental pieces of legislation to sort of work things through

of that shut down\nUm and that's just some of the things that they were cited for a by the occupational safety health and Safety Administration\nSo eighty thousand plus dollar fine uh I don't know of from contact if that is a particularly large fine given the size of the company given the violations at hand is there a sense that this is a really punitive or is this a slap on the wrist\nKnow thinking about that yesterday and perhaps I'm not comparing apples to apples here but um we have covered mines that have been assessed by OSHA against treasure shipyards here and superior I'm at the ship building company\nAnd a recently and you know as soon as two years ago they had been assessed\nAh more than a million dollars in fines for blood lead poisoning of a couple of hundred workers there um they eventually settled that down to about three quarters of a million dollars\nBut uh I think there are people and that that there definitely are people who have said that this fine as a slap on the wrist and you know if you're going to have um if you're going to neglect or not be taking care of that's appropriate to prevent this kind of incident\nAnd what kind of find is appropriate um to ensure that something like that never happens again\nLeslie means everything\nConspiracy theory goes a little like this well aware of the attention he draw by acknowledging\nThe existence of a

Peterson of apple can find more Wisconsin ice that Wisconsin I work on the\nPhone rang [noise]\nNow new research led by you W Madison has revealed some fascinating information about one of the world's tiny but might eat little creatures and it's a lot of ants are farmers or two hundred and fifty ... of um in fact to end in evolutionary terms ants were very early adopters of farming\nAccording to this new research they figured out how to make the right partner shift to keep their crops thriving\nCamera encourage the Ira al ... and professor of bacteria ... W Madison sort of a lead researchers on this project sitting how ants created a relationship with bacteria to become successful fungus farmers camera thanks a lot for joining us today think Iran will give us the timeframe first of all of the particular answer looking\nAt here so the so the answer we study or a tribe moments that include as you said about two hundred and fifty species that um [noise] the estimate is that they evolved to do this fungus gardening and fungus growing up but I'm fifty to sixty five million years ago\nAnd people maybe they're not really thinking of ants as farmers but they they do a fair amount of of different kinds of ... and agriculture\nYeah they in fact you ... you know our current available evidence suggested they probably were the first farmers or some other groups of insects will grow their own food but um these ants um or one of the best examples of of in nature of of farming\nAnd at this new research involves amber right ads caught me amber amber is this amazing thing it seems like every few weeks we're fighting cool information for the past trapped in amber what are we looking at in this amber\nSo so in terms of the study from from the amber perspective we got we got material for a ... there was a kept her from Dominican amber I'm these ants um were embedded in amber ... estimated Fifteen to twenty million years ago\nAnd what it's really incredible but this is that we could see the microbial some mad that we work on in bed within the amber so what this means is that the ants were associating with this microbe a Fifteen to twenty million years ago\nAnd talk about this relationship now the answer going some kind of fungus first yes so what I talk about the fungus and and ants agriculture as relates\nTo them so so that the ads you know it's very it's actually incredibly um fascinating complex association the finance grow fungus for food like we grow plants for our food they cultivate a women's role mushrooms growing up around here we do we do um\nUh in like human farmers the ants have problems with the agricultural diseases so so passive their fungus garden and this\nIs a pathogen is a another fungus\nThat attacks in consumes the fungus answer culturing and and if this fungus grows a can grow very rapidly in in completely devastated fungus gardens ... of the ants\nSo the ... the the organism we were focused on is actually a fourth player in the system so it's actually bacteria the ants use that produces antibiotics that helps protect the fungus from the pathogenic fungus\nAnd part of the interesting story is if I if I had this right the ants if their body said devolved to have a little nooks and crannies for this helpful bacteria that that help stop this blight\nYeah so so so the major aspect of the study is kind of studying these structures in these structures in some ants can be incredibly elaborate in in in one way of thinking about it is that the ants um can be completing the outlaw\nWe're cavity so these are kind of embedded within the exoskeleton the ants and inside the cavity is where the bacteria gross and so so these structures change in ... a change incredible ways over the fifty sixty five million years of this association\nSo you've got a ... like I guess a timescale over millions of years of how these ants changed their bodies actually change to be better carriers of this helpful bacteria yeah yeah\nAnd if you're a researcher on ants these are of changes are incredibly elaborate and fascinating and and there's many different\nVarieties of changes in the structure but what what's really exciting for us is that the changes in the structure and the the multiple origins of these structures indicate these ants have been using these bacteria for production antibiotics for tens of millions of years and that's what's particularly exciting but our study\nRight and this is an interesting story a study in evolution and it didn't happen just once you're saying\nYes so so originally we we've known about these anti by producing bacteria for almost two decades now and originally it was thought it originated once and the association I'm maybe originated\nYou know relatively recently or ten or maybe ten million years ago we weren't really sure but what we show is that um [noise]\nUh not only did it evolve at the very early origin and association was you know therefore indicating it's really critical this success of the growing and the fungus governed by the ants\nBut that there's multiple origins of the structures that maintain it across the evolutionary history of the association and that indicates that there are strong selection on the ants to protect their bacterial ...\nSo the ants have this evolutionary pressure in a fact of the better a carrier they are for this bacteria that happier home they provide the more likely aren't they already have a successful fungus crop and in a way of what's in it for the bacteria do we know if the bacteria are ... are you know happier to be with these ants that bring him to the food they won\nYes that's a great question the so so the bacteria are only known to be so ... certain members of these bacteria are only known to be associated the answer so the ants provide the niche where were these bacteria curse it so that that's a major benefit but the other benefits they they they receive from the answers\nUnder these elaborate structures in inside the aunt or actual gland cells that are connected to the these Crips in these cavities\n'em through the channels and the ... the the ants through the lens ... are are feeding the bacteria so the nutrients hotter the bacteria are derived from the and so it's really\nAnts cultivating culturing bacteria with a on in in their bodies to produce these antibiotics\nAnd the story I'm hearing here is evolution in somebody's works more and more complicated ways than than I learned at the you know we learned that gives all runs faster to get away with it from the cheetah that she'd run faster catch up with a gives out these are different species coal evolving to gather a sort of competing with yet a third and fourth these two different kinds of fungus yeah it's\nThe whole community of organisms that you know play different roles in one of the fascinating aspects of you know microbiology right now is the recognition of\nThe importance of beneficial microbes in the complexities communities as as you may know where there's a lot of research going on in the human micro biome and and the the microbes on our skin and our miles in our nose in in our guts mediating human health and\nAnd so this is a really great um system for for understanding how hosts and beneficial microbes\nSo we might be interested as humans in studying things like how\nEspecially in the world of antibiotic\nResistance yeah and and that's a major part of the research we do in the lab is is thinking about I'm understanding um or any book resistance or in the system but also we look for new antibiotics from these bacteria in the ants we've discovered a number of new I'm\nSo you're right this wasn't really the first opera but it was the first one that really caught on can you talk about it a little\nExactly um what do you did that was different was that he created some drama that really had an emotional impact so he definitely wasn't the first person to set music to sat words to music\nBut he was he was the first person to do so in a way that really really kind of affected people emotionally so there were composers before him um ... Perry for example\nWho also created opera but they somehow didn't make the same impact so what Monte Verde did in his genius was to create a form of song drama that really resonated that had people in tears that somehow impacted them in a way that\nFor a previous works in the genre had an so for example you know their ... their reports some people breaking down in tears at first performance of his work and something about the way that he set words to music was very powerful and you can just hear from that that tiny snippet\nAnd speaking of emotion it up or you introduced me to afraid I I wasn't from somebody or with but I Love it\nWell Rachel are as as you offer characters are often angry about something or they're frequently feeling betrayed and they're often feeling betrayed was very good reason because somebody's just done something terrible to them more runoff with someone else said they're heartbroken\nSo rage arias wore an important part of um a baroque genre of opera called opera Sarah ...\nUm and handle for example road a lot of fabulous rage arias where the characters just kind of vans and lament and ... and you just you just feel their anxiety so deeply\nWant to give a listen to another piece now and this is when he mentioned actually a Mozart and at the magic flew to pay for that\n[laughter]\nAnd\n\n\nSo those earlier days the operas uh you're right we're really that elite audience is it by Mozart's time that we're starting to see a more a mass\nAppeal in the opera\nYes and and also in Mozart's time he did something that was with for example the marriage of Figaro he actually dared to rebel against the authorities a lot of the the operas written before Mozart\nWe're very we're very deferential to the people who commissioned them I mean Monte Verde for example was employed by the court [noise]\nUm I was a ... but what Mozart did during the time when he wrote the marriage of Figaro is he actually dared to kind of express this you know minor rebellion against the authorities which was fairly notable at the time\nAnd there are worries at some point food cultural commentator saying oh I'm worried this uh this opera is going to populist the common people are liking it and that's that's wrong\nRight so basically in the world you've had this kind of strange situation where it's the pendulum has really swung between opera being this thing that was commission for and performed for royalty\nAnd then it somehow became a little more popular and then you had various very lofty and somber unimportant academic saying oh no we mustn't have this we have to keep it short and elitist and you know we don't want the common the common masses listening to this\nUm and then in the in the nineteenth and early ... century became much more popular and you had\n... you had singers like Caruso who gave the first um Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast and reached enormous audiences\nAnd then later in the twentieth century I think the pendulum is kind of swung back a little bit and it's deemed again is somewhat elitist about\nWomen and opera I Know Shakespeare and you're you're right about the comparison shakes dirt Shakespeare could write parts for women but boys had to play them because they could be up on stage what what are there similar things with opera\nOver the years [noise] yes there were so at the beginning of opera I'm back in the seventeenth century you had this very unfortunate tradition of the strategy which are basically we're young boys who'd been castrated before puberty to ensure that their voices never broke\nAnd the reason that uh this horrible thing was was done was that was because women weren't allowed to saying publicly said they had to\nSays and kind of balanced out the choirs\nI'm later on their women were were allowed to saying I'm and interestingly opera was actually one of the few avenues that women had says I'm earning their own money you know at a time when women weren't allowed to own property or really had no rights at all [noise]\nSome of the famous um some of the best known women singers at the era were actually pretty successful in their own right\nVivian Schweitzer is with us pianist and

Washington bureau chief for the Huffington Post Amanda welcome back to central time all ... all one of the big stories people are following the FBI apparently wrapping up pretty soon this investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh lot of confusion this week over the scope of the investigation who is going to be interviewed\nAnd I just not know about this up your investigation\n[noise] well it looks like that\nAs of now Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh are the two main players in this are not going to be interviewed by the FBI I'm at the request of the White House and a\nFord has said that she wants to be interviewed actually just a few minutes before our conversation her legal team uh sent out a letter or a responding to a request for some documents and said we're happy to provide them but she wants to be interviewed by the FBI\nAfter all she was one of the people who requested the FBI investigation uh\n... you know Republicans have said that there's no need to talk to them because they have already testified before the Senate Judiciary committee they should have told the committee everything and the White House said like look if senators have more questions for them they should've asked they had their chance to ask them but they are interviewing people who are supposedly\nA witnesses people like Mark judge you Christine Blasey Ford said was president during a her sexual assault by cap it up but it seems like there are a lot more people out there who say they have information that could\nAh corroborate afford the allegations are maybe help cabin up but it doesn't seem like the FBI's investigation is going to get everyone\nYou wrote a recent piece looking at an FBI investigation and harassment claims by Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation back in Nineteen Ninety One or how do the result of that investigation factor into the confirmation process\nUh extension is making permanent of those individual tax cuts as you said the Senate or doesn't look like they're going to pick that up at all is this an opportunity to do for Republicans to run on see we we pass your individual tax cuts into put Democrats on the spot voting for our for or against that\nAnd that's obviously why they passed it um but\nAgain I think that Democrats\nHave a pretty easy for bottle of all why didn't you do that to begin with um dispel isn't going to go anywhere you know why were they looking out for corporations and they'd only worry about passing your tax cuts and making them permanent later and this individual belt which is harder to pass\nSo you know again from what I've seen Republicans there happened some Republicans talking about the tax legislation but overall it's just not something they're running on\nA they just know it's it's not popular so when they do talk about taxes it's much bigger about Democrats not supporting tax cuts are wanting to raise your taxes um\nThat you know there are issues that the public feels very strongly about this election cycle health care is very very high on the list\nRepublicans for years ran on\nRepealing Obamacare and this is the first cycles since Obamacare passed that Democrats are running more ads on it because Obamacare has gotten more popular and people don't want to see it repealed but that's not what's driving people to the polls just as\nPeople may like tax cuts uh but it's not driving them to polls this ... sort of a larger issue\nOf the political atmosphere sort of how they feel about their candidates and Trump and and the general political I'm sort of just the general political atmosphere I'd say more than ... individual issues and the change they want to see in the country\nWants to take one more call on the politics of the economy down is with us more Tomas down hello\nHow are you good what do you think\nWell I think that while you're caller diverge your guess those are some salad or is it worth it with a rather large rush a single the corporations are able to big corporations Betty companies are are regulated up in one hundred and five voted voted rude\nGod's church bridge are expanding their share of reduced the unemployment rate is not losing business about losing votes ... but by and experiment gr operations to afford were hurt him for the raiders or the lowest level existed here's\nThe other thing is to say that you know wages are starting to well that's also not really accurate because there are a ... or do the numbers all sort of wages are rising\nSo rising of ... everybody would Lloyd probably not for going backwards ... those are things that have been avoided voters her foot\nDown thanks a lot for the call Dan pointing to a good movie season and Republicans are the unemployment number alone or something that Republicans could be could be trying to run a\nAnd a traditional election they definitely would be but it's still it's still the fact that a lot of people aren't seeing their wages and their quality of life change as dramatically as Trump a search trumpets when he is on the campaign trail um you know Democrats also\nWhen they talk about the tax bill talk about uh the immense deficit created by it and sort of warning that Republicans are going to\nA target cuts in Social Security and Medicare to pay for it um you know this is especially because Republicans for so long talked that sort of ... Democrats\nFor not paying enough attention at reducing the deficit\nIt's just you know like I said in this election cycle the economy and the state of the economy and as much as Trump wants to take credit for it it is just not the driving issue and it's not enough to motivate people to get out to the polls necessarily\nThanks for the call Dan we're talking to Amanda Terkel from the Huffington Post and get some of the big issues of national politics one move on to a couple of other stories now I Want to ... it's got a national angle and relevant to our neighbors to the west and Minnesota where you're from us\nGeneral in Minnesota has been under investigation by the attorney hired by the Democratic party in that state prohibitions of domestic abuse can you bring us up to date on that store\nSure well I mean it's it's really hurting Allison's reelection bed at ... Congressman Ellison a sort of a rising star in the Democratic party this progressive superstar and he's running for attorney general but he has this domestic abuse allegation hanging over him and the party hired\nSomeone to independently look at it and she found that sort of the most\nSort of the most are the biggest allegation in there that he started dragged her a off their bed while shouting profanity at her and twenty sixteen that that just couldn't be substantiated other woman Karen Monaghan a\nAn ex girlfriend of Keith Ellison said that she has video but she hasn't produced and she's sort of keeps changing\nA explanations for why but there are still questions of whether you know in their relationship there was maybe emotional abuse verbal abuse things like that so you know the the the report sort of a\nHim out of the worst allegation and said that there just wasn't enough evidence for it but it still hanging over him and that sort of me too movement and it's still something that his Republican colleagues are using against him and that makes many Democrats uneasy with his candidacy\nAnd the president former President Obama had released a bunch of new ah Dora Smith started races around the country David this is one he did not Asian endorsement are noticeably\nWhich is surprising you know in any I mean people are very excited when it when he fell us and said that he was going to be running for attorney general right now attorneys general around the country are sort of at the front edge of\nA heading back at President Trump Keith Ellison is no was known as a congressman as being incredibly aggressive outspoken a progressive champion and so this seems like a good role for him somewhere where he could maybe do a little bit more than being in Congress a but now it's just you know Democrats are not only worried about his candidacy and\nLosing the attorney general seat to a Republican but what effect he could have on the other candidates\nAnd I want to turn to go to a more abstract notion of the pace of national news lately Amanda was it just two or three weeks ago we were all trying to figure out who wrote the anonymous op ed ministry official Bob Woodward book was the the game changer that we're all going to be talking about for weeks and months to come now\nSo many other things have happened since then of course the Calvin are confirmation President Trump's comments yesterday or this New York times that we haven't even talked about on Donald Trump's for natural history a one story crowds on another story really fast lately\n[noise] yeah I mean honestly I completely forgot about that or not I'm In New York times from Berlin without food [laughter] and how every reporter what's supposed to be spending their time trying to amass that person and it's now been sort of forgot and\nBut I mean it's just crazy in any other administration I feel like one of these stories would just be a giant scandal or or what President Trump said about the death because of the hurricane in Puerto Rico you know any other ... that would just\nBe such a big scandal and now you know we've all moved on from it and so Trump in many ways is are benefiting from the chaos and the constant\nA churning news cycle of the the news about what's going on that people can't keep their attention in one place I Can't really dig in on one thing but the cabinet thing seems like it's going to be sticking around all the Republicans are trying to push through as quickly as possible\nOr does it feel like and reporting on Congress to national politics but do you get a sense to be reporting about are feeling the senses of chaos of this fast\nOh absolutely I mean you infrequently ask lawmakers on Capitol Hill about something and they're like I haven't even seen it yet or they sort of roll their eyes and and like I Can't keep up with that I mean\nYou know I mean senators especially don't really like dealing with all the cast coming out of the White House because they were asked by reporters respond to it and it's not necessarily\nWhat they want to be dealing with either I'm sure they would much love to be talking about the tax bill and the economy and things like that or what they have going on in Congress but is that after a spot that the president's tweets or something he said that a rally so it it's completely you know Washington is very different you know during the Bush years\nIs there a sense that uh this is how it's going to be forever or is this maybe how it's going to be during the Trump Administration however long that might laugh the other two or six years whatever\nDefinitely during the Trump peers whether this continues that is a big question that everyone wonders and I don't know they might cut and the next president is\nAll right we'll leave it there for now Amanda thanks as always for joining us today\nBank yeah we would talk to a mandatory goals she's the Washington bureau chief for the Huffington Post she was with us for a look at some of the week's top political news so time for you to weigh in on our question this week how important is the economy for you as an issue in the November midterm elections\nYou can tweet us at Central time at WNPR you can always tweet us at Central time WNPR you can also email ideas at WNPR dot org let us know what you think\nComing up after the news the great lakes compact was signed into law a decade ago today we'll talk about the original push behind that law and the challenges it's based in two thousand and aid including some new information about a major water diversion plan that was approved\nBack in twenty tone but stayed under the radar in many ways since then our guest tells us about that I've also look at the Foxconn water diversion story the long saga and walk his jaw and more I'm Rob ... stick around there's more to come on central time here on the idea of network [noise]\nAnd the region near the governor's office in Michigan said it's going to be reviewing things and so I end the news is just a couple couple of weeks old since the book a first came out and so that everyone is still processing it but it's it's I think we're going to hear a little bit more about pleasant prairie going forward\nIt will be watching for developments let's take a step back now to talk about the compact more generally what was the main goal of the great lakes compact\nYeah so for decades and decades there has been a fear that is the\nWater situation in the United states in globally becomes more and more stress that there'll be increase global regional continental pressure on water rich regions of the world like the north American great way so the compact was designed\nAs what I call legal water fence to keep Great Lakes water inside the great lakes basin so that the the the jobs come to the water rather than sending the water to the job somewhere else agriculture cities et cetera\nAnd how far can we take water out of the great lakes and there's a there's some little gray areas that that the ... story is part of that but how much is is diversion limited\nYeah so there are two key exception clauses on the great lakes compact\nAnd those are accepting clauses for communities that straddles sit right on top of that Great Lakes basin line that soup bowl rim of\nA watershed that surrounds the the five North American Great Lakes and then there's also a straddling county exception clause for communities that are in counties that straddle the base in line with the communities communities themselves are clean and clear outside the great lakes basin\nAnd so those straddling county applicants which is what Walker shah was\nHave a much higher bar a dentist into straddling community applicants which is an example would be new Berlin outside of Milwaukee\nOr is it the straddling community applicants only the approval of the local state but ... Shaw and other straddling county applicants need the approval of all eight Great Lakes governors ah which is a super high bar called approval from Minnesota to New York\nTalking about Peter Annan author of the great lakes water wars about the great lakes compact on the tenth anniversary of of it being signed into law and\nA diversion efforts that have gone on to the last ten years and those are the future to be the one that's got a lot of attention you already mentioned it earlier is or the Foxconn this huge a corporate say dust real development of with its own diversion request can you put that in the context of the great lakes compact\nAnd and the Foxconn propose a really also was surprising to a lot of people because the authors of the compact and told me that they they didn't really envision that you know a giant Thirteen thousand employee facility\nActually straddling the great lakes basin line so we talked about straddling communities we've talked about straddling county as well to Foxconn situation brought up a straddling corporation that literally\nThe the the facility which is going to be the size of three Pentagon is sort of partially inside the great lakes watershed and partially out of it\nBecause it's partially out of it it required a was needed a ... a wad of diversion application is located in the community of Mount Pleasant which is just west of or seen Mount Pleasant doesn't have its own water supply system it gets his water from Racine\nThereby Racine applies for the water diversion on behalf of Mount Pleasant which is in part implying on behalf of applying on behalf of Foxconn\nAnd so that sort of stir things up and new ways because there's a debate going on and the least\nMay you know asking the question whether or not a water was meant to be diverted for corporations and because there is language in the compact that says the water really is for public water supply purposes primarily residential in nature\nNow we hear about the volume of water that goes to some of these projects were talking about in the you know millions of gallons which sounds like a lot does a diversion like the ... one of the Foxconn plant compared to the volume of the great lakes do they really make that much of a difference\nYeah it's the they do not and you're right those those numbers sound like they're big you know seven eight million gallons per day\nUm but you know if you have six ... billion gallons and the great lakes which is the number of the so large is hard for people to wrap their head around it but these diversions we're talking about would really be in measurable if somebody tried to measure the impact that they would have on the great lakes and it's important to remember\nThat one of the key changes that the great lakes and brought the great lakes compact brought to the water diversion debate is that it requires that this water all the return to the great lakes after it's clean the clean Water Act standards\nAnd and um and discharged uh to to the water body so that idea to be really known that loss under these water diversions\nAnd but but throughout the history of the great lakes water diversion debate and concern it's never really bad about any one water diversion\nCreating damaging in of itself to the great lakes water levels it's the fact that there can be precedent that could be set that could sort of lead to sort of a a death or destruction by a thousand straws if you will that there's some kind of camel's nose gets in\nA into the process and then it creates a legal precedent by which could be expanded by future diversions et cetera et cetera et cetera but again the great lakes compact with this you know to just only allowing water diversions all of which have to be returned\nFor communities on or near the great lakes basin line really rein things in it because if you're not a community that's on the base in line or just outside and\nYou can't even request a Great Lakes water diversion so the lake's really have never before been better protected and what we see after ten years of the great lakes compact is you know we're working into new areas the documents being tested to legal mechanism as being Texas Tech tested\nAnd it's you know it's like I didn't know the ... conference at Marquette University I should ask for to it as a ten year old child it's not even a teenager yet and it's normal for these complex environmental pieces of legislation to sort of work things through over time we're talking with\nPeter and right now co director of the ...
