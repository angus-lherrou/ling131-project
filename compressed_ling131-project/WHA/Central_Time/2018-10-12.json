election polls came out this week and they both had very different results the Marquette University law school latest poll showed Governor Scott Walker with a one point lead over Democrat Tony ... but just yesterday an NBC Marist Poll showed ... up by ten points over Walker and a head to head match up an eight point lead with third party candidates included\nSo why do we do and we see two poles with to drastically different results\nHarry Anton is a senior writer an analyst for CNN politics and I go to guy on polling Harry welcome back my pleasure to be back so when you see Harry same race or\nBig difference like that what do you start digging into to see why they might be so far apart\n[laughter] I think the number one but I'll point out is obviously all these calls have margins of our rights so when I see to results that are different I don't necessarily panic I say okay maybe\nSomething you know it's just that the statistical noise but then I did a little deeper and I said to myself okay if it's not statistical noise what might be causing this and in this case there is one major difference between the two poles and that\nIs that mark cat weighted by education levels and marriage didn't\nAnd one of the beliefs that we have\nA ... why the polls dot everything wrong in the Midwest in two thousand six team\nWas there weren't enough non college educated white voters in them and of course those voters tend to be more Republican and since March ... did wait by education it could be that they are waiting up those non college educated whites that marriage simply isn't and it's possible certainly not saying that it's definite but it's possible that's why we're kept chose a lower total\nFor Tony ... versus Walker and why mark ... maybe a little post a picture\nSo pollsters are looking at the demographics of the people that they reached the random surveys and saying okay there's that and how does it compare to the realistic demographic breakdown of people who actually vote is that right\nYeah I mean that's really what pollsters are trying to do at the end of the day is in order for appalled to be as accurate\nOf representation of the voting population is possible I have to look like right um and so there are a bunch of different variables that different pulse us we'll look at and say okay we either we don't have enough whites without college degrees or we don't have enough African Americans all our sample is too old or it's too young\nDemographic variables like those\nTraditionally are the variables that most pollsters weight off of but in this particular case Maris weights off of income and Marquette or weight off of education and that may potentially be causing this difference and there was of I'm certainly not saying it's all of it in fact it might not in most of it\nBut it's probably a decent portion of it\nI understand a lot of polls use different definitions of what a likely voter is when they're doing a likely voter poll mark Katz based on a a voters certain devoted to find that merits uses a different model how different polls\nI heard somewhere you are into all wine cap mushrooms lately that's not a mushroom I think I'm familiar with I tell us about that one\nThat's the European mushroom that can be found now nationwide or as kind of an escape be but it's a super easy mushroom the goal I started drawing that one\nInto solving town odds very fast growing very high yielding or we can grow that mushroom and there's little was like five weeks after we are and I use ... marks here plant though\nYeah why quote mark say it's not exactly planting likely what a planner working with spores here\nWe're actually working with blonde or my\nBelly of the uh the organism itself the the fungus not the not the reproductive cells we've got them already spread out into a medium such as ... or a grand or ... or a couple of other holding\nMediums we're adding that to a larger meat and letting that colonize them so with wind cash we grow them on straw as what we're adding is the spawn mixed Assad us too that straw\nNow if I wanted to get some mushrooms bond I wouldn't know where to go well where do we go to buy that the basic materials we need the basic guy sources for our mushrooms\nThat you have a little bit of laboratory knowledge was certainly build your own at home but there are some fantastic company a one right here in Wisconsin field and forest products over in ... and they are the best in the business\nEnd up talking about the range that how many different kinds of mushrooms Khanna a beginner find at a place like that and get started with at home\nHold dozens or lots of choices they've got a catalog that's kind of fun to look through ... through all the pond suppliers so yeah your your choices are not limited you there's a there's plenty of choice was if you like to wipe buttons you can go to the white buttons out\nThere actually a little more difficult than say a wind cap or or ...\n... are are the more expensive at the store I Know it seems like there are fewer and far between so that seems like a great one to try to grow or at home I save some money and grow really fancy one\nAbsolutely and you can do it a lot or you can buy a small kits that you can go in your kitchen counter the Olympics up about a square foot and you can get a fresh ... mushrooms and just a matter of days\nAnd you mentioned the different kinds of mediums ... things like that what does she talk you'd like to grow him\nExclusively would or or saw dust blocks the press them into a like a

and cutting down their weight off [laughter] but I Do have a I've had grapes\n... so that's been my primary source for the last probably four years now and it's proven to be a very productive and easy to find and it's always straight that's always five inches in diameter it's it's very nice to work with\nAnd what different kinds of mushrooms coming God Matt ... already mentioned ...\nHe'll go on

Walker because of the nature of his uh you know how he um a\nA has governed and and the the course that he's taken then in Wisconsin has become a symbol of a U.S you know certain brand of of Republican politics and Wisconsin is of a is of importance to President Trump's\nI'm uh twenty twenty prospect so so yeah I mean they're they're they're paying attention to this what\nYou too I Know this is your busy months so thanks for taking a few moments with us today Chad what got you interested I Know you follow stories the supernatural in local folklore what got you interested in the way we think about death and burials\nIt was really working on a series of books about old death and what I was fighting is the obituaries back then were much different than today is where is it something like old man Lewis died peacefully surrounded by his loving family\nBack then they included all agree there's lead details of the death so much so that it's like reading a horror novel back then and that got me started about how people view gas how they were closer to it\nAnd what they did to avoid it or at least avoid those coming back from it\nAnd we kind of sanitized it a lot in the modern days you're not going to see those for example grisly details and most of ... for example\nYeah they don't last call the death occurred none of the circumstances and we remove death from our life\nThat often times in the old days people died in their homes they have this feeling world there they had to wait there they would take photographs with the dead as a souvenir and maybe the only true they add of the deceased and they'd have to\nDo right and the polar hence the term Filner a parlor but today we've kind of open source that all\nPeople go to hospice and then the funeral director takes care of it all so I think we're a bit more removed from it today than they were in the old days\nYou're going to be talking about some burial techniques and costumes that uh the sun Prairie Public library let's get a sneak preview with some of the things a lot of things people used to do were based on what I see is a very rational fear of people\nThis may seem a little silly today with modern science and medicine but\nWhether you are in a diabetic shocker in a coma doctors would offer to pronounce your dad and lo and behold many people would pop up just in the Nick of time to be saved from being buried alive so they were terrified of it\nSo they came up with several inventions one which was this spring loaded cough and that had a handle on the inside\nSo fuel awoken found yourself buried alive you could always handle and it would flip the top of the coughing up\nI don't know how well it worked with six feet of dirt over half of that but I Do it in numerous accounts of Paul bears not being careful as they should and moving the body and it triggered that lever end up came the top of the Afghan giving everyone quite the scare\nOh boy that's not good did did you come across any stories with somebody pulling the lever like waking up in the casket and you know pulling the lever just in time before they got married\nNot with this spring loaded casket because they were very rare and the same goes for the cemetery bell that was a bell that would sit on top of your grave with a rope going in on a whole year cast it\nThe same effect you could pull it it would ring the bell and alert the caretaker who've lived at the cemetery that you'd been buried alive and they could theoretically come and rescue you but\nOne problem they had is on many nights the Wynwood set these cells off giving the caretaker quite as scary thinking everyone was buried alive\nYou know would they would there be a false alarm and they dig up a craving that instance or maybe they go and say oh no clearly the wind is blowing it\nYes they were double check it and I heard from a lot of people that their churches when they would have a funeral and the old days we do a series of not at the very beginning when they closed the cough and they would knock several times and listen for a response\nOn the way to the graveyard they were knocked several times and then on the last right before lowering the tune in they would knock again and lifts and just to give somebody a chance in case they were buried alive\nTalking to a chat Lewis researcher and author he's written a lot about the supernatural and other ah strange stories here in Wisconsin an around the world you're talking now about it's October we're looking at a burial traditions some strange ones are from Iran has passed and\nChad you see some a customs and rituals were based on being worried about super natural stuff ah vampires that kind of thing what what went on\nYes it's amazing how superstitious people were in that era and\nEverything from putting a iron bar on the casket of a loved one with the belief that they could not spirits cannot pass through iron ore you'd seen iron gate around their grave not to keep us out like most people think\nBut to keep the spirits in\nRural places around the world they would often bury their loved one with a brick in their mouth so they could not come back as a vampire\nOr if you were afraid of someone you're wrong then life coming back to haunt you your bury them face down so if they chose woke up and tried to dig their way out they would actually be digging deeper into the ground\nSo a lot of these weird\nProcedures that people had to do to protect themselves from the paranormal\nWhere's your particular times and places where these worries about some kind of weird supernatural thing happening with recently deceased were really important to people\nIt was really the height of it was the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds which also was the height of the spiritual is ...\nI not only does your spirit continue on but you could contact that spirit through a say on or a medium or psychic and it was a for high society it was great to be invited on the weekend two assailants in town that was the the hip thing to do at that time is to be invited\nAnd they'd have a big say on what the traveling medium that would come in\nAnd people would be fearful that their loved ones were unhappy with them in the afterlife\nYou mentioned that earlier Chad that we didn't used to do things in funeral homes and whatnot we had a home funerals very often can you give us a sense of of what these were like\nYes there were some very dense but also a celebration of the life that it's so amazing people actually collect death photos because oftentimes when someone passed on uncle Louis or what be at that\nPeople would gather and take photos with the deceased body especially children\nAnd they would carry that photo around because oftentimes again that might be the only poll all they had all of that relative and it wasn't creepy it wasn't seen as spooky or gruesome it was seen his everyday part of a white and\nThere are a lot of collectors who are picking those photos out of old free markets and the white court interested in the historic or relevance of them\nAnd that's got to be a big prize for people who are doing family genealogy I guess probably\nYou go back to a certain year this is the kind of picture you might be able to find a of a you know your ancestors\nYeah and maybe the only photo you had because again especially in the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds if you had a photo it was very expensive so often times the only photo some people have is when they were deceased\nAnd finally I Am a big topic in October and I'm thinking about a horror stories in the supernatural the idea of grave robbing and a child you see that used to be an industry\nFor a while why yes\nPeople could make a living being a grave robber and what they would do is follow the obituary section of the newspapers and as soon as someone who was buried they would go out that night dig them up\nAnd take the body and they did it not order some gruesome serial killer type lurking they did it because they were hired by the nation's medical facilities and our colleges that these\nPrograms did not have enough ... for the medical students to work on so they would under the table hire these grave robbers this deal bodies bring them to the university where they could conduct their medical procedures on them so many people are in quite a living doing that\nAnd that's I I guess thankfully I went away as we have we developed a system where people could donate to their remains to science right\nYes and of course once people started being buried with concrete over them to make it much more difficult than just digging a hole in retrieving the body so we try to prevent this on many different areas and aspects of it\nAnd ... before we let you go what kind of stories are you looking to collect your ... what kind of stories or you hunting for when it comes to a burial customs\nI always love family traditions that when there's a whole set of rituals you had to go through when someone died in your house first thing was to open a window so that spirit could leave your house you'd have to cover the mirror so I could not come after you you\nHave to take the body feet first out so they would not look back at your house and attach their spirit there but I'm looking for\nMay have only been practiced by one congregation or one family those are the things that really interests me because as I said nothing as weird as a\nGood place to leave it Chad thanks for joining us again keep an eye out\nAt ... Louis He's written over twenty bucks on folklore and the supernatural he'll be talking more about burial traditions on Wednesday October seventeenth at the sun Prairie Public library that talk starts at six thirty it's free\nA is a a moment of almost refreshing candor that an American administration is being forthright with what exactly is the relationship between the king dome and to and Washington\nAt the same time it's erroneous to say that because of what the president feels is a hands tied approached that were the United states to exert more influence and pressure Henri\nOdd that they would somehow ... that in turn elsewhere to purchase a weapons and what is after all a very lucrative and competitive arms market or the Saudis will not purchase arms from Russia they will not purchase arms from\nChina a first of all because they haven't ever had them second of all there's a lot of technical know how there's a lot of spare parts and there was a lot of maintenance that goes into that along with actually a the training that goes into learning how to operate these are these munitions\nThat has all been for the last eight decades really within the exclusive province of the u._s. and perhaps maybe to a lesser degree\nCERN that President Trump has Israeli ill conceived\nIt's not going to cite con from Wayne State university about the latest in the U.S in Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of a journalist and Saudi origin and Washington Post columnist at the Saudi embassy in temple said taking will step back now putting this in some wider context it's all going on\nIn the midst of this war basically in Yemen and Saudi Arabia and its allies in the region are involved in this with us a blessing going back to the Obama administration using a U.S made arms\nAnd we've got some senators from both parties are in the last few months saying hey we should reconsider selling these arms to talk about how Yemen and all of this\nWell Yemen looms very largely because after all Saudi Arabia has been conducting operations there now for almost five years in at least a stated effort to repel Iran's influence there and yes Iran certainly is a supporting the who the rebels\nIn Yemen but the fact that Iran then becomes the bogeyman and is seen as the specter of real fear and real existential threat seems to then be driving a lot of the um ambivalence and perhaps even the confusion as to what to do and this is permeating even into the United States Senate\nReflexively it would seem as though many senators many Congress people would a demand that there'll be at least the suspension if not a further level of punitive action against Saudi Arabia especially even when it comes to the arms sales but at the same time a particularly Republican members of of the Senate\nOr have doubled down on this idea that Iran is in fact the existential threat\nAnd as a result of it it seems as though there are willing to give the so these a little bit more leeway than to come down as a as roughly as they otherwise would\nAnd this all goes to a one figure in the Saudi Government he's got a lot of attention Mohammed bin Salman crown prince here of parents a lot of people in the west looking at him at maybe this liberalizing forest wanting to you know allowing women to drive among other things but\nA lot of concerns about cracked down on his rivals both him and his family and across Saudi Arabia can you talk about this this key figure\nWell Mohammed bin ... on a I think sees himself in some ways as a as the great Gatsby and other ways as Michael Corleone I'm not sure what other movies we can really invoking this case may be comedy was from uh uh the gladiator but he is a thirty to thirty three year old very charming very charismatic a\nVery multi dime actually thinking uh individual he is a in fact the crown prince his father a king sol mine although the ... head of Saudi Arabia\nOr suffer from dementia is quite old and infirm so essentially a mama been song bond or NBS as he's known has been running the show in a variety of sectors a minister of defense a head of the commerce than investments a department\nHead of the shura council or the Justice Department so essentially a the buck stops with him on all counts\nHe is rather impetuous or he certainly wants to move Saudi Arabia forward with his vision twenty thirty of modernization of diversification of the economy beyond just oil a certain level of liberalization at the same time he is an enigma and he's a paradox\nBecause on the one hand he has given women the right to drive\nWhich has certainly modified or the west but at the same time he has also jailed many uh uh women reformers and advocates and activists\nWithin the country so he is certainly giving with one hand and what it seems taking a lot more from uh the other at the same time he has made a charm offensive and many western capitals like Washington but also Ottawa London and Paris\nCharmed western leaders into thinking that he is the future of a new Saudi Arabia\nOr that is something that is rather dangerous because he has taken that then as a mandate and as a license to conduct some rather egregious campaigns not only within Saudi Arabia but as you mentioned before uh the uh the very large humanitarian crisis that have pretty much singlehandedly has caused in Yemen\nWe're talking to a

and farmers market and hand with them know how care and patients you can also grow mushrooms right at home or Wisconsin mushroom expert tells us how to get started\nFirst two big election polls came out this week and they both had very different results\nThe Marquette University law school latest poll showed Governor Scott Walker with a one point lead over Democrat Tony ... but just yesterday an NBC Marist Poll showed ... up by ten points over Walker and a head to head match up an eight point lead with third party candidates included\nSo what do we do and we see two poles with to drastically different results\nHarry Anton is a senior writer an analyst for CNN politics not go to guy on polling Harry welcome back\nMy pleasure to be back\nSo when you see Harry same race or you know they are so a part in a poll and a big difference like that what do you start digging into to see why they might be so far apart\nI think the number one well point out is obviously all the polls that margin of error right so when I see to results that are different I don't necessarily like I say okay maybe something you know it's just that the statistical\nNoise but then I get a little deeper and I say to myself okay if it's not that that's the noise what might be causing that and in this case there is one major difference between the two calls and that is that\nMore cap weighted by education levels\nAnd marriage it ends and one\nDot everything wrong in the mid west too fast and fix theme was there weren't enough non college educated white voters in them and of course those voters tend to be more Republican and its Marquette did wait by education it could be that they are waiting up those non college educated whites that marriage simply an ethics possible\nCertainly not saying that it's definite but it's possible that's why we're catch shows a lower total\nFor Tony Uber's versus Walker and why mark ... maybe a little closer to the truth\nSo pollsters are looking at the demographics of the people that they read something random surveys and saying okay there's that and how does it compare to the realistic demographic breakdown of people who actually vote is that right\nYeah I mean that's really what pollsters are trying to do at the end of the day is in order for a poll is accurate\nRepresentation of the voting population as possible I have to look like it right um and so there are a bunch of different variables that different pulse us we'll look at the say okay we either we don't have enough\nWhites without college degrees or we don't have enough African Americans all our sample is too old there it's too young\nDemographic variables like those traditionally are the variables that most pollsters weight off of but in this particular case merits weights off of income and Marquette ah weights off of education and that may potentially be causing this difference and the result I'm certainly not saying it's all of it in fact it might not him most of it\nI heard somewhere you are into all wine calf mushrooms lately that's not a mushroom I think I'm familiar with I tell us\nKen mushroom that can be found now nationwide\nOr it was kind of an escape be but it's a super easy marshal the girl I started drawing that one\nInto solving town odds very fast growing very high yielding or we can grow that mushroom and there's little was like five weeks after we are and I use ... marks here plant though\nYeah why quote mark say it's not exactly planting likely what a planner working with spores here\nWe're actually working with bonds or my belly of the uh the organism itself the the fungus not the not the reproductive cells we've got them already spread out into a medium such as ... or a grand or ... or a couple of other holding\nMediums or adding that to a larger meat and letting that colonize that so with wind cash we grow them on straw as what we're adding is the spawned mixed Assad us too that straw\nNow if I wanted to get some mushrooms bond I wouldn't know where to go well where do we go to buy the the basic materials we need the basic guy sources for our mushrooms [noise]\nThat you have a little bit of a laboratory knowledge was certainly build your own at home but there are some fantastic company ah one right here in Wisconsin field and forest products over in ... and they are the best in the business\nEnd up talking about the range that how many different kinds of mushrooms Khanna a beginner and find at a place like that and get started with at home fall\nDozens of lots of choices they've got a catalog that's kind of fun to look through ... through all this on suppliers so yeah your your choices are not limited to there's a there's plenty of choice was if you like the white buttons you can go to the white buttons that\nThey're actually a little more difficult than say a wind cap or or oyster rushed she talked\nSo ... are are the more expensive at the store I Know it seems like there are fewer and far between so that seems like a great one to try to grow or at home I save some money and grow really fancy one\nAbsolutely and you can do it a lot you know or even buy a small kits that you can go in your kitchen counter the Olympics up about a square foot then you can get a fresh talk of Muslims and just a matter of days\nAnd you mentioned the different kinds of mediums ... things like that what does she talk you'd like to grow in\nExclusively would or or saw dust blocks the press them into a like a loaf of bread is what it looks like huh\nFor that how to arrange when you've got some cool looking month a great pictures and your book by the way I think about what kind of would you're working with you when you grow mushrooms in that and those racks outside\nWell I if

one two three four to eight hundred six four to one two three four\nI'd tell us about it or if you need some advice from Davis why we'd love to take your question as well and eight hundred six four to one two three four\nAt Davis you mentioned that compost I have a compost bin\nOut back or I could take some hot out what kind of machines can grow on compost\nA one that grows really well is our common store bought mushroom the white bumps button but the thing in that genus of ... oh we've got some\nBeautifully scented almond mushrooms are also in that genus uh they grow really well in ... uh one of the more common would the mushrooms that we have here are the bullet which you can find in the wild they're out right now are they also do really well and compost\nA and is that a is that the last one we could buy from a store or from the supply as you mentioned or what do we have to a harbinger of forging ourselves\nWho you'd have to ... to grow it that's not one you're going to find a video stores\nAnd how whether sensitive are mushrooms I how what kind of extremes can may take a during the normal growing season five\nWell extreme heat does have a tendency to do some damage obviously extreme cold will too I almost called in yesterday when we were talking about all the rain and how it's affected farmers to say it's great for mushroom farmers\nYou know I've I've had I had a ... a extremely successful year due to excessive bring it up so that type of extreme is is definitely helpful drought on the other hand a lot more difficult to handle\nAnd talk a little bit now about cooking mushrooms I Know you've got some recipes I in your book how what are what are some of your favorite ways to consume the mushrooms you grow for\nYou know I'm not a very good cook a fry everything I have and butter and it's just fine goals recipes were supplied by a chef's of restaurants that I saw mushrooms too so I Believe that and to them\nYou know but I honestly what you just said it's my favorite way to eat mushrooms too frightened butter little salt and pepper you don't need to get very fancy do you\nKnow if you want to taste the monster might say keep it simple\nAnd ah when so this time of year obviously we've raised getting cold we're not going to start planning your outside mushrooms now wide when do you get started in the late winter spring when you get started

I've been this race or behind by a chunk of depending on which poll this week you follow but clearly if the vice president who's here national Republicans are paying attention to our race for governor here on the state\nYou know no doubt I mean a ... Walker because of the nature of his uh you know how he um a a has governed and and the the course that he's taken in in Wisconsin has become a symbol of a U.S you know certain brand of of Republican politics\nAnd Wisconsin is of a is of importance to President Trump's I'm uh twenty twenty prospect so so yeah I mean they're they're they're paying attention to this what\nIt was really working on a series of books about old deaths and what I was fighting is the obituaries back then were much different than today is where is it something like old man Lewis died peacefully surrounded by his loving family\nBack then they included all the grisly details of the death\nSo much so that it's like reading a horror novel back then and that got me started about how people view gas how they were closer to it and what they did to avoid it or at least avoid those coming back from it\nAnd we kind of sanitized it a lot in the modern days you're not going to see those for example grisly details and most of ... for example\nYeah they don't last how the death occurred none of the circumstances and we remove death from our life\nThat often times in the old days\nPeople died in their homes they had the funeral there they had to wait there they would take photographs with the dad as a souvenir and maybe the only true they add of the deceased and they have the the the owner right in the polar hence the term Filner a parlor\nBut today we've kind of open source that all people go to hospice and then the funeral director takes care of it all so I think we're a bit more removed from it today than they were in the old days\nAnd you're going to be talking about some burial techniques and costumes that uh the sun Prairie Public library was getting a sneak preview with some of the things a lot of things people used to do were based on what I see is a very rational fear of people worried that they were going to be buried\nAlive\nAnd this may seem a little silly today with modern science and medicine but\nWhether you are a diabetic shocker in a coma doctors would offer to pronounce your dead and lo and behold many people would pop up just in the Nick of time to be saved from being buried alive so they were terrified of it so they came up with several inventions one which was this spring loaded cough and\nThat had a handle on the inside so fuel awoken fallen yourself buried alive you could always handle and it would flip the top of the coughing up\nI don't know how well it worked with six feet of dirt on top of that but I Do and the numerous accounts of Paul bearers not being careful as they should and moving the body and it triggered that wherever and\nGiving everyone quite the scare oh boy that's not good\nDid did you come across any stories of somebody pulling the lever like waking up and the cat's gonna you know pulling the lever just in time before they got buried\nNot with this spring loaded caskets 'cause they were very rare and the same goes for the cemetery bell that was a bell that would sit on top of your grave with a rope going in on a whole year casket the same effect you could pull it it would ring the bell and alert the caretaker who've lived at the cemetery\nThat you'd been buried alive and they could theoretically come and rescue you but\nOne problem they had is on many nights the Wynwood set these valves off giving the caretaker quite as scary thinking everyone was buried alive\nAnd would they would there be a false alarm and they dig up a craving that it's this or maybe they go and say oh no clearly it was the wind is blowing it\nYes they would double check it and I heard from a lot of people that their churches when they would have a funeral and the old days we do a series of not at the very beginning when they closed the cough and they were knocked several times and listen for a response\nThe way to the graveyard they were knocked several times and then on the last right before lowering the true and they would knock again and lifts and just to give somebody a chance in case they were buried alive\nTalking to a chat Lewis researcher and author he's written a lot about the supernatural and other a strange stories here in Wisconsin and around the world you're talking now about it's October we're looking at a burial traditions some strange ones are from Iran has passed and\nChad you say some a customs and rituals were based on being worried about super natural stuff on vampires that kinda thing what what went on\nYes it's amazing how superstitious people were in that era\nAnd everything from putting a iron bar on the casket of a loved one with the belief that they could not spirits cannot pass through iron ore you'd seen iron gate around their grave not to keep us out like most people think\nBut they keep the spirits in\nRural places around the world they would often bury their loved one with a brick in their mouth so they could not come back as a vampire\nOr if you were afraid of someone you're wrong then life coming back to haunt you your bury them face down so if they woke up and tried to dig their way out they would actually be digging deeper into the ground so a lot of these weird\nProcedures that people had to do to protect themselves from the paranormal\nWhere's your particular times and places where these worries about or some kind of weird supernatural thing happening with recently deceased were really important to people\nIt was really the height of it was the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds which also was the height of the spiritual is movement which believe that when you die not only does your spirit continue on but you could contact that spirit through a say on or a medium or psychic and it was\nA for high society it was great to be invited on the weekend two assailants in town that was the the hip thing to do at that time is to be invited\nAnd they'd have a big say on what the traveling medium that would come in and people would be fearful that their loved ones were unhappy with them in the afterlife\nYou mentioned that earlier Chad that so we didn't used to do things and funeral homes and whatnot we had a home funerals very often can you give us a sense of of what these were like\nThere were some very dense but also a celebration\nPeople actually collect death photos because oftentimes when someone passed on uncle Louis or what would be at that\nPeople would gather and take photos with the deceased body especially children and they would carry that photo around because oftentimes again that might be the only pulled all they had all of that relative and it wasn't creepy it wasn't seen as spooky or gruesome\nIt was seen his everyday part of a white and there are a lot of collectors who are picking those photos out of old free markets and the white court interested in the historic uh relevance of that\nAnd that's got to be a big prize for people who are doing family genealogy I guess probably once you go back to a certain year out this is the kind of picture you might be able to find a of a you know your ancestors\nYeah and maybe the only photo you had because again especially in the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds if you had a photo is very expensive so often times the only photo some people have is when they were deceased\nAnd finally I I'd a big topic in October and are thinking about a horror stories in the supernatural the idea of grave robbing and a chapter you see that used to be an industry\nFor a while why yes\nPeople could make a living being a grave robber and what they would do is follow the obituary section the newspapers and as soon as someone who is buried they would go off at night and getting them up and take the body and they did it not all the some gruesome serial killer type lurking they did it because they were hired\nBy the nation's medical facilities and our colleges that these\nPrograms did not have enough ... for the medical students to work on so they would under the table hire these grave robbers this deal bodies bring them to the university where they could conduct their medical procedures on them so many people are in quite a living doing that\nAnd that's I I guess thankfully uh went away as we have we developed a system where people could donate their remains to science right\nYes and of course once people started being buried with concrete over them to make it much more difficult than just digging a hole in retrieving the body so we tried to prevent this on many different areas and aspect of it\nAnd Chad before we let you go what kind of stories are you looking to collect yourself what kind of stories are you a hunting for when it comes to a burial customs\nI always loved family traditions that when there's a whole set of rituals you had to go through and someone died in your house first thing was to open a window so that spirit\nCould leave your house you'd have to cover the mirror so I could not come after you you have to take the body the first out so they would not look back at your house\nAnd attach their spirit there\nBut I'm looking for a lot of the local traditions that may have only been practice by one congregation or one family those are the things that really interests me because as I say nothing as weird as a\nGood place to leave it Chad thanks for joining us again\nKeep an eye out at San Louis He's written over twenty bucks on folklore and the supernatural he'll be talking more about burial traditions on Wednesday October seventeenth at the sun Prairie Public library that talk start to six thirty it's free and open to the public\nWith what exactly is the relationship between the kingdom and to and Washington at the same time it's erroneous to say that because of what the president feels is a hands tied approach that were\nThe United states to exert more influence and pressure Henri odd that they would somehow ...\nAnd turned elsewhere to purchase a weapons and what is ... very lucrative and competitive arms market uh the Saudis will not purchase arms from Russia they will not purchase arms from China a first of all because they haven't ever had\nThem second of all there's a lot of technical know how there's a lot of spare parts and there's a lot of maintenance that goes into that\nAlong with actually a the training that goes into learning\nHow to operate these are these munitions that has all been for the last eight decades really within the exclusive province of the U. S. and perhaps maybe to a lesser degree a Great Britain so that concern that President Trump has those really are ill conceived\nIt's not going to cite con from Wayne State university about the latest between the U.S and Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of a journalist and Saudi origin and Washington Post columnist at the Saudi embassy in temple said taking a little step back down putting this in some minor contacts is all going on\nIn the midst of this war basically in Yemen as Saudi Arabia and its allies in the region are involved in this with us a blessing going back to the Obama administration using a U.S made arms\nAnd we've got some senators from both parties are in the last few months saying hey we should reconsider selling these arms talk about how Yemen fits in all of this\nWill Yemen looms very largely because after all Saudi Arabia has been conducting operations there now for almost five years in at least a stated effort to repel\nIran's influence there and yes Iran certainly is a supporting the who the rebels in Yemen but the fact that Iran then becomes the bogeyman and is seen as the ...\nExistential threat seems to then be driving a lot of the um ambivalence and perhaps even the confusion as to what to do and this is permeating even into the United States Senate reflexively it would seem as though many senators many Congress people would ah demanded that there'll be at least a suspension\nIf not for their level of punitive action against Saudi Arabia especially even when it comes to the arms sales but at the same time a particularly Republican members of of the Senate or have doubled down on this idea that Iran is in fact the existential threat\nAnd as a result of it it seems as though there are willing to give a the so these are a little bit more leeway than to come down as a as roughly as they otherwise would\nEnd this all goes to all one figure in the Saudi Government he's got a lot of attention Mohammed bin Salman crown prince here of parents a lot of people in the west looking at him at maybe this liberalizing forest wanting to you know allowing women to drive among other things but\nA lot of concerns about cracked down on his rivals both within his family and across Saudi Arabia can you talk about this this key figure\nWell mama been sold on a I think sees himself in some ways as a as the great Gatsby and other ways as Michael Corleone I'm not sure what other movies we can really invoking this case may be comedy was from uh uh the gladiator but he is a thirty to thirty three year old very charming very charismatic\nA very multi dimensional a thinking or individual he is a in fact the crown prince his father a king sol mine although the ... head of Saudi Arabia or suffer from dementia is quite old and infirm so essentially a moment been song Bonner NBS as he's known\nHas been running the show in a variety of sectors a minister of defense a head of the commerce than investments are department head of the shura council or the Justice Department so essentially a the buck stops with him on all counts he is rather impetuous or he certainly wants to move Saudi Arabia forward\nWith his vision twenty thirty of modernization of diversification of the economy beyond just oil a certain level of liberalization at the same time he is an enigma and he's a paradox because on the one hand he has given women the right to drive\nWhich has certainly modified the west\nBut at the same time he has also jailed many uh uh women reformers and advocates and activists within the country so he is certainly giving with one hand and what it seems taking a lot more\nFrom uh the other at the same time he has made a charm offensive and many western capitals like Washington but also Ottawa London and Paris and as a result of it it seems as though he has charmed\nWestern leaders into thinking that he is the future of a new Saudi Arabia\nOr that is something that is rather dangerous because he has taken that than as a mandate\nAnd as a license to conduct some rather egregious campaigns not only within Saudi Arabia but as you mentioned before uh the uh the very large humanitarian crisis that he pretty much singlehandedly has caused in Yemen\nWe're talking aside con right now senior lecturer in Near East and he's in studies and global studies at Wayne State university with us to talk about the diplomatic relationship between us and Saudi Arabia and what might happen between the two countries following the disappearance unlikely death of an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia\nYou can join
