than eight hundred and thirty points yesterday and bounced around a lot today other market indicators the NASDAQ the U.S and be five hundred didn't fare so great either both were down significantly yesterday and today\nThe first time in nearly two years at the market is seen stumbles like this market watchers are pointing to a number of issues that could be scaring investors ranging from interest rate hikes to ongoing terror of battles\nA county a tiny as a reporter for the wall Street Journal in New York where she covers the u._s. stock market and investing a county welcome back to central time thanks for having me all ah with the close this afternoon\nJones today so all told we lost a five hundred and forty five hundred and forty five points on the Dow today so that's almost Thirteen hundred points that we've lost over the last few days and one of the worst today stretches for the market this year\nAnd we've talked before about these numbers Thirteen hundred points so some pretty big when it comes to a percentage of the stock market value we're going for much bigger starting point so how how big a deal is this a male perspective\nIn the past I mean we've talked about how you know when the Dow can lose or gain several hundred points it's not actually that big of a move\n'em but actually the moves that we've been seeing this week in the stock market has been pretty significant um yesterday we actually saw the largest one day percentage declined since February and today's move and the Dow is also raking\nIn the top ten worst sell off for the Dallas scare so it has been um pretty severe what we've seen the last couple of days\nResidents Trump was interviewed on Fox News yesterday I asked whether trade policy from the White House might have something to do with the volatility of the market I listen to what do you have to say\nWhat took you didn't billions of dollars in terrorists are from China from Chinese goods that it doesn't hurt us at all which I get in ... millions of dollars of we're going to make products here that without buying and John and know that was it the problem that I have is what the fed the fed is\nGoing wild I mean I don't know what the problem is but they're raising interest rates are this ridiculous\nAnd the president has talked about those interest rate increases today to use this or reason maybe they're bumping up there is so important rate at the federal going into what that is in a minute but is this a plausible explanation for this drop in ... in a stock\nInvestors that's certainly one of the things they mentioned I mean alongside trade I'm the fed and its course if interest rates have been the key um area of concern for investors throughout the year because you know for the last nine years we've seen us stocks drive higher and I think a lot of investors credit\nThat in part to the fact that rates have been near historic lows for so long and so when you're not getting that much out of treasuries a investors are more willing to take on risky investments like stocks\n... a pop culture and entertainment reporter for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel she recently wrote about some of Wisconsin's quirky of mascots lean eat welcome to central time\nHi thanks for having me why I came from a high school called the tigers really non creative there there are a lot of us Spartans in Wildcats an eagles what put you on the path of finding the more unique names in Wisconsin\nUm yeah I mean I went to a school we were the Indians and changed halfway through to the patriots so sort of in my back story that then coming to Wisconsin I'm not from here so coming to Wisconsin you're like okay what is the ... [laughter]\nIt's kind of stands out as like that's not a thing right or should I should I Know what this is so kind of looking into you know what started with a whole bag and then kind of stumbled upon so so many interesting\nUm names for high schools and their ... you know it's across the country there's a lot of fun\nRegional names for high schools nicknames but Wisconsin seems to have quite a few uh the ... just the tip of the iceberg um that's in Ryan lander there's also the ... galloping ghosts\nI'm going way way up north I'm to\nLet's see Washburn they have the castle guards nearby and melon it for granted diggers Ashland as the or darker so it's like very fine kind of historical names and some new ones thrown in so it was a very fun to kind of get stories from people and here where they came up with these creative clever fun nicknames for their high school\nSo let's get into some of those and you had an online poll for people to pick their favorites I at the journal sentinel there and yeah and the ... they were number one and this is a perfect storm of the mascot right it's like a local connection it's unique it's fearsome creature talk a little bit about the ...\nYeah so the ringleader hotel bag it is not real some guy ... you'll just bet on that right yes arguable [laughter]\nThis man named Eugene shepherd in Eighteen Ninety three so I was quite a back story he made it up as sort of a prank\nTo lure tourists to like the logging industry was kind of dying down up north so he had this idea of like Lori tourists and he also just kind of like ... like to have fun so became this\nSort of um like a\nLike a fun way to like draw people in and it's it has endured in the town to this day so they did like a fake hunt for who died they had like this puppet that appeared\nAt a county fair there so it's just it goes on and on there's like stores in Ryan land or there's a giant statue of a hotel bagging ran lander\nUm and of course it's our high school mascot so it's definitely the mascot for the town which is the case for a lot of these schools but this one has taken on its own larger than life persona\nAnd there's one that I wanted to have a a back story the ... you mentioned the galloping goes I wanted them to have their local legend to sleepy hollow or something like that there's nothing like that though that's a different kind of story\nYeah that's a different one it's on this one dates back and think of as to the forty is when they um the ... or the ... team was playing the\nWrote about how the team was that white uniforms and they just like they beat the Appleton terrorists who are really good team and it looked like they were ghost galloping over\nThe um ... and it was I was like a Halloween games that kind of its stock and then they their school really just like leaned into this um mascot and\nThe principal at one point invited a student to ride that horse to the game so just became this huge\nUm tradition that they still do today and today they're mascot is actually a nine year old girl um she they need someone who knows how to handle horse so she's a student in their school district not through high school um she rides on the field and like delivers the game ball to the referees at football games\nAnd you wrote that I think is one of the administrators is in charge of cleaning up after the horse itself\n[laughter] yeah they have he said I spoke with him and he said yeah usually falls on me and they've got a new like astroturf field so they have to keep it very nice and so yes that's you know doing the dirty work to for the athletic directors\nForgot to call her now at eight hundred six four to one two three four Haley is with us from KUT a halo\nHigh\nWhich mascot did you want to tell us about Haley\nAh in the mind Illinois there's a high school and then that guy is the pretzels\nI've heard about that do we have a pretzel in Wisconsin sewers that's just the one I've heard about I don't think so I don't think that an alien somebody in some kind of postal pretzel costume you know\nYeah yeah that's like right around the games and just like I trusted salty but it's all\nRight thank you so much and that reminds me of a good food the one that was cause I think you wrote about it the the cheese makers of Monroe\nYeah I didn't write about that one but they yeah there is a cheese makers there's also the paper may there's two paper makers so there are a lot of like jobs based ones I'm not sure what they do for the cheese maker if it if they serve cheese that their games or if they [noise]\nUm but yeah if they dress up as a wedge of cheese I'm sure there's lots of Packers um she's out of there [laughter]\nThat's ... but I look that's a common theme you found like something in local industry the the ... to up and asked one that they were they won that are used to be the upper gold or just because their colors were purple and gold\nThey were that was a that was an interesting when actually spoke or emailed with the\nThere was a young sports writer who is I think maybe Seventeen Eighteen or Nineteen\nI'm In the forties who've Roach who decided that ... was too boring and so he decided he was going to give them a new name and it was for the or dockers they used to ... um ship all this or\nOut of that region um that that school is or that town is right on Lake superior and they would ship or from the region out of these huge stocks and so that was a job that people had was to like\nMake sure that the or made it from the train down into these huge ships so those were the or doctors and now\nThey don't have those stocks anymore but they are still the or doctors in memory of those\nOf their past it's got a note a dentist and coon valley called and said mentioned the Watertown golf links that sounds like an adorable math and popular one yeah and I've got a picture here of the Freeport pretzel mascot and yeah it's a full on a pretzel twist\nA you know a person inside the south and I wasn't sure how they'd pull that off but it it it works but you you gotta look on line to find the okay doesn't want us to check that were there challenges are for some of the use in finding Laney us for some schools in fighting okay we got this great name now how do we represent the mascot\nYes I have two fun ones for that the I think the orders are probably the most maybe most creative and there I mean that's what it is not an opportunity their actual physical mascot there from El ... lake in glenview lessons\nBut the the students dress up as if they're on vacation as they are the same day so that's pretty fun ... yeah yep 'cause there that was um a popular resort destination is ... century so\nThat one's fun and then the granite diggers are very very proud of their um chipper the chipmunk mascot\nHe um [noise]\nThey it comes from they have a lot of black granite there and the I guess they're alive chipmunks running around these pilots are not so they decided that you know sort of like a double like their animal mascots could just be so chipper is a granted ticker he works He has a pickup truck there\nOkay and I was what I thought granted bigger I was assuming as Wisconsin state rock we read the granite but no it's not the red granted\nUp there yeah no it's the ... I guess they have there's black granite ferry it gets shipped aren't used to get shipped all over\nI don't know if it's sold us and now one thing Wisconsin is not known for his castles but we've got the wash my school castle guards how did that come to\nThat one came to be there are also known for granted and they had the screen it was used to build some buildings and so it was used to build their school and the school\nThe old school used to look like a mask or it used to look like a castle and so that and it looked over their football fields so when they would play they would they would say oh it looks like the football team is guarding the castle\nUm unfortunately that school to burn down and their replacement school does not look like a castle but in ... to their former school building they have kept\nThe um the mascot and so I asked on the mascot dresses as what some kind of medieval castle dart or something yeah it's a night basically though yeah [laughter] so any\nOthers that we haven't gotten into that tell you we're excited to see well\nA lot of people um disputed disagree they thought that I you know skipped over quite a few um some people were very very impassioned about the um old ... old Clare memorial high school all dams\nSo and that that's mascot has quite a history in Wisconsin all day but is the name of this eagle that a civil war regiment I'm actually brought into battle in the civil war named after Abraham Lincoln the eagles named after Abraham Lincoln\nUm after the civil war he them eagle went to the state capital [noise]\nUm and died in the state capital in the fire\n'em and then they like they have there is a replica now still that you can see of all day and so this one high school I'm In Oklahoma or has it as their mascot so it's an eagle but his name is all day and it has this I'm very Wisconsin history to it\nAre going to be under that kind of stress that might lead to divorce\nTalking to somebody who's from evergreen state college in Libya Washington looking at changing trends divorce rates going down we're also getting married a different times of different ways and stuff I mean this is a part of the strain or you've been looking at a lot\nAnd some amazing just huge changes are happening people living together not married talk about how that's changed and how our attitudes toward that as\nWell you know it wasn't that long ago when it was just a living and sand [laughter] was considered terrible today only Seventeen percent of Americans disapprove of cohabiting before marriage and the majority of marriage is to begin with premarital cohabitation um\nCohabitation is a complex subject because there's two types of cohabitation one is the cohabitation and people who've knowing each other for a while who think that they probably will get married move in together live together for a while and then go on to get married\nWe used to think that cohabiting before marriage was a risk factor for divorce but it turns out that that's not true uh in fact there is some segments of population\nWhere coal happening before marriage with the intent the Mary actually improve your chances of the marriage thing together\nBut there's another kind of cohabitation and that is when people are under economic insecurity and um they don't have they they need to move in together they feel a financially they'd like to get married and not quite ready financially but they're also not able to get to maintain two households\nAnd they're in that sector of the population you get cohabitation\nOccurring much earlier in the relationship with much greater possibility that it won't be a good match a and\nThat in itself shows some changes it used to be back in the Nineteen fifties the average couple who married knew each other for only six months today that would be a huge risk factor\nFor divorce because marriage is so much more individualized requires so much more negotiations so when people move in together too fast nowadays\nThey often don't proceed to marriage at all\nEspecially something I've seen anecdotal reporting on and maybe you know if there's data on how often does happen real cohabiting couples human economical you can secure conditions breaking up but they can't afford to ranch near ... post breakup is not something we know about how widespread it is\nDon't know how widespread that is a again I've seen the anecdotal uh accounts to and as a historian I Know that this happened a lot during the great depression I've interviewed people I'm a old stirs a I interviewed in the past about living the great depression some of them talked about putting a curtain down to\nTo move out to the divorce rate fell madly in the great depression but that didn't mean that marriage is with that [laughter]\nWell let's look at the baby boomers as I understand that there are the ones who who drove these higher divorce rate how are they doing now is the age [noise]\nWell um I think that it's true that the baby boomers\nTo drive it and I think that part of that\nWas because um they came of age in a period when gender roles changing very very rapidly and women's expectations were rising more quickly about those changes than men's behavior\nAnd I think that since that time I think one of the reasons that divorce rates stabilized his men and women are adjusting to the new set of rules of marriage and the new gender norms and um we for example no that men are up until the Nineteen eighties if I'm a woman had more education than her husband\nA that was a risk factor for divorce is a um if she earned more than her husband and that's a bit factor for divorce both those things are not true for marriage is formed a since the Nineteen nineties and that's another reason why\nYoung people I think are doing so well the baby boomers have had um many of them have had the voices earlier and then gone on to uh other marriages some very successful but once you've\nDivorced once it's easier to voice again and we saw between Nineteen Ninety and twenty ten we saw a tripling of the voices of couples age sixty five and all over the ... and a doubling of the voices of couples age fifty in older that's leveled off now\nUm and there I think there's some disagreement a demographer Philip Cohen who is a much much more skilled at at numbers and I think we're going to see a continuing declining rate of divorce among older people I'm\nNot sure about that because older divorces are different than younger voices older divorces\nAre usually because we've just grown apart he's gotten an empty shell marriage and people nowadays are not willing to put up with that and they have lots of alternative is outside of it\nSo I Would say that anybody getting married now should recognize that marriage nowadays our expectations of it are such that there is yes your chances of divorce go down the longer you're married but they don't disappear and it's really important to keep working on that relationship in a way that might not have been in the past\nWhen people just felt like they didn't have any alternatives\nWere talking to stop the codes professor at evergreen state college in

Milwaukee she's leading a team that's working to find a treatment for Alzheimer's Karen welcome to central time\nOh thank you so much so here's the CDC saying this huge increase in the number of people with Alzheimer's by the year twenty sixty what's your reaction to ah to their production\nI think it's dead on I think it's that on it really is in line with a numbers that the Alzheimer's Association has been generating for for several years\nIs this a question of more of a higher rate of people are going to be developing all timers or is this just sheer demographic you're going to have more older people and they're the most likely people to have all timers\nI think it's it's in some respects the combination of both but I think it's more that um that there are more older people um age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease so the the ... population the more people are simply more likely to develop the disease um\nAlthough I think also our our diagnosis I'm really see that these are are far greater than they used to be so more people are being diagnosed more accurately these days\nNow age as you mentioned was a a primary factor and risk for Alzheimer's it are there any other a demographic indicators groups of people who are more or less likely that we know now to get all summer\nSlowly um women um women are\nThere about two thirds of the Alzheimer's population right now\nI'm a woman or at a greater risk um they also tend to the greater incidence of Alzheimer's disease in um minority populations so I'm Hispanics and African Americans\nIt's unclear why that is whether there's something about um [noise] it has to do with race or or socioeconomic status education\nUm so that's um that's something we we don't know yet enough about 'em there's also there are certainly\nGenetic causes so Alzheimer's disease isn't a single disease or say there are people who get Alzheimer's these very early on in their fifties and sixties they called it early onset Alzheimer's and those are that seems to be associated with certain genetic mutation\nYeah gosh I mean you know doing basic research like like we do um you know you you recognize that could be\nMany many years from you know discoveries we make 'em a lab to ultimately something that's going to help patients but but we have to keep that hope I mean that really you know keeps us going to think the things that we are going to learn here in our in our laboratory will help inform\nUm you know the next generation of of treatments whether they directly lead to\nA potentially novel drug or a potentially lead to an insight that can be incorporated into a clinical trial that um you know can can ultimately help people so we always have to be optimistic and and have that hope that uh that this work will uh will ultimately lead to something that will benefit people's lives\nWho leave it there for now Karen thanks a lot for joining us today thank you so much\nDuring breakfast a psychology professor you W Milwaukee we talked with her about her research in fighting a treatment for Alzheimer's disease coming up you hear about a unique dance performance happening this weekend in Wisconsin featuring the solo work of female dancers fifty years of age and older when you're from two of those dancers coming up on central time\nI'm a I'm making marshalling alone and I donated my black says\nYes three hundred to Wisconsin Public radio I really love my car and I didn't want to give it up I was eight months pregnant and it was clear that the car was not going to be the best car ... you have do we donated my cars so that we could get a new better maybe friendly guard that we currently\nDonate your car to car town vehicle donation program go to W.

I'm a when women\nUh see other women are doing something non traditional and um so I in the previous shows that we did we did one in Iowa seat in one in here in Milwaukee their responses war that\nThat this woman's cells to represent says on the stage there's women felt\nConnected there is I'm a ... since I I think that this is the body as the body ages the body becomes a in our in our society almost ... significance and and I think that the a senior so where women\nAre working with their bodies when and where their capabilities like chopping was saying pushing our boundaries because you know for me to be on on this stage tomorrow I had to leave my emails and live all that the uh the district of wars is I have to be on the on the on a classroom\nWith my students they can class from one of my peers so when\nWhen we go there and we actually a shared those experiences we're sharing experiences of pain of\nHappiness ... all of a transcendence of watched this body you know and the labels that are within the body can that can can bring\nAnd shopping as we start to wrap up I understand these shows are with our cities are officially\nSay that I think that there might be some chances are a few seats um they may be obstructed or some people may not show up so pleased still shots as there is still a shot but I'm excited for the for the um response to to to our show\nWell and with that response I wanted to ask you does that mean there is a good chance of a sequel ooh well we'll have to talk more about that All right ah but ah or maybe more performers\nLike I said luckily we're in a little bit of a drier stretch here in the least we can try to get the river levels down a bit\nNot going to Todd say warning coordination meteorologist at the national weather service office in La Crosse by the way we want to hear from you were going to take your calls in a few minutes\nHow did this flooding season this high rainfall effect you your community your farm your house you name it let us know you can call in right now at eight hundred six four to one two three four hundred\nSix four to one two three four or post on the ideas network Facebook page\nTodd I don't know how long it takes to catch up with these high water levels is there a concern that okay if we end up in the winter with a heavy snow fall season worthy or levels are so high that can be a problem\nYeah um you know it's hard to say if\nIf the wet pattern will a progress through the winter and necessarily reflect in a snow here than normal winter\nBut I think one concern we all have is going into the next springs snow melt season you know one of the factors that always goes into that is where the rivers that what's the saturation level of the soils and you know we know that we're going to go in to the springs snow melt already\nSo you know obviously have to see how the winter pans out and how the melt occurs next spring but um yeah you know where to go when you go into a winter with high water ready it it certainly is is not a good thing\nLooking back again and there's a heavy rainfall season what's going on up in the atmosphere there that's led to all of this rainy weather\nYou know I Would think the the main factor has been the the kind of stuck weather patterns that we've been in a you know before August twentieth and therefore that the end of August heavy rain events hit we did have a couple of weeks of pretty dry weather going and then\nThe weather pattern took a shift now I don't know of any of us meteorologist out there know exactly why weather pattern\nSets up and ... as long as it seems to at times\nBut we went into a ... a warmer and wetter weather pattern that just kept allowing a you know the higher humidity levels that higher moisture values and and that adds to the fuel for these storms and then when they start to a reform\nOver the same areas like we saw in Madison Middleton area and in Iran August twentieth or that's when you can get those those high rain events the flash flooding a big impact um and then you have sometimes have patterns where it sets up for days like that and that was kind of the end of August and September that we experience and so [noise]\nUm you know just kind of a weather pattern that refused a shift for our luckily like we've talked about it shifted now to a cold or dryer pattern\nNow we've got some flooding in the news today apparently deludes and I'm not sure if it hits superior to buy a flood it because of high wins on Lake superior is a story you're watching\nYeah a little bit ah a National Weather service up in the Duluth areas certainly on top of that but you know there's one other area of the state that that did have a you know some above normal rainfall too and that is a south east of the Ashland area and I'm a southeast of superior\nAnd now with this uh this kind of cold spell this is kind of a fall system that just went through ... had brought in a lot of wind with it uh and that is a big impact on the great lakes and so that's\nA slightly different type of weather phenomena as this weather pattern kind of shifted but\nNonetheless they've had their shares of uh impact in the northern and the north one as well\nAs hot as we start to ramp up you mentioned we've got what looks like a dry spell in the short run coming up a water the longer term forecasts for the remaining couple of months of the fall\nWell luckily you know it was looking like going in October that it was going to be a I guess above normal precipitation chances kind of\nA near normal temperatures scheme I'm not a lot of signals either way as we go into the I guess the first couple of months of winter outside of a maybe going back to a more of a near normal temperature and precipitation patterns so [noise]\nYou know hopefully just than a as you mentioned earlier than near normal or rain or snow falls don't cause us any uh any more headaches with that\nTodd thanks a lot for joining us today\nAll right thank you and stay safe out there\nNot seeing the warning coordination meteorologist at the national weather service office in La Crosse we talk to them about flooding

mean I went to a school we were the Indians and changed halfway through to the patriots so sort of in my back story but then coming to Wisconsin I'm not from here so coming to his guns and you're like okay what is the ... [laughter]\nIt's kind of stands out as like that's not a thing right or should I should I Know what this is so kind of looking into you know what started with a whole bag and then kind of stumbled upon so so many interesting\nUm names for high schools and their ... you know it's across the country there's a lot of fun\nUm regional names for high schools nicknames but Wisconsin seems to have quite a few uh the ... just the tip of the iceberg um that's in Ryan lander there's also the ... galloping ghosts\nI'm going way way up north I'm to\nLet's see Washburn they have the castle guards nearby and melon it for granted thinkers Ashland as the or darker so it's like very fun kind of historical names and some new ones thrown and so it was a very fun to kind of get stories from people and here where they came up with these creative clever fun nicknames for their high school\nSo let's get into some of those and you had an online poll for people to pick their favorites I at the journal sentinel there and that yeah the ... they were number one and this is a perfect storm of a mascot right it's like a local connection it's unique it's fearsome creature talk a little bit about the ...\nYeah so the ringleader hotel bag it is not real if some guy ... you'll just bet on that right yes arguable [laughter]\nThis man named Eugene shepherd in Eighteen Ninety three so it's quite a back story he made it up as sort of a prank\nTo lure tourists to like the logging industry was kind of dying down up north so he had this idea of like Lori tourists and he also just kind of like ... like to have fun so became this\nSort of um like a\nLike a fun way to like draw people in and it's it has endured in the town to this day so they did like a fake hunt for who died\nThey had like this puppet that appeared at a county fair there so it just it goes on and on there's like stores in Ryan lander there's a giant statue of a hotel bagging around lander\nUm and of course it's our high school mascot so it's definitely the mascot for the town which is the case for a lot of these schools but this one has taken on its own larger than life persona\nAnd there's one that I wanted to have a a back story the ... you mentioned the galloping goes I wanted them to have their local legend a sleepy hollow or something like that there's nothing like that though that's a different kind of story\nThat yeah that's a different one it's um this one dates back I think it was to the forty is when they um [noise]\nThe ... or the ... team was playing the Appleton terrors and a reporter wrote about how the team was that white uniforms and they just like they beat the apples and terrorists who are really good team and it looked like they were ghost galloping over\nThe um bonuses and it was I was like a Halloween games that kind of its stock and then they their school really just like leaned into this um mascot and\nThe principal at one point invited a student to ride the horse to the game so just became this huge\nUm tradition that they still do today and today they're mascot is actually a nine year old girl um she they need someone who knows how to handle horse [laughter] and so she's a student in their school district not through high school um she rides on the field and like delivers the game ball to the referees at football games and you wrote that\nHorse itself [laughter]

divorce rates going down and we're also getting married or at different times of different ways and stuff I mean this is a part of the strain or you've been looking at a lot\nAnd some amazing just huge changes our cohabiting people living together not married talk about how that's changed and how our attitudes toward that as\nWell you know it wasn't that long ago when ... it was just a living in San Juan considered terrible today only Seventeen percent of Americans disapprove of cohabiting before marriage and the majority of marriage is to begin with premarital cohabitation um cohabitation\nIs a complex subject because\nThere's two types of cohabitation one is the cohabitation of people who've knowing each other for a while who think that they probably will get married move in together lived together for a while and then go on to get married we used to think that cohabiting before marriage was a risk factor for divorce but it turns out that that's not true uh\nIn fact there is some segments of the population\nWhere cohabiting before marriage with the intent to marry actually improve your chances of the marriage thing together\nBut there's another kind of cohabitation and that\nIs when people are under economic insecurity and um they don't have the they they need to move in together they feel a financially they'd like to get married there not quite ready financially but they're also not able to to maintain two households and there was\nIn that sector of the population you get cohabitation occurring much earlier in the relationship\nWith much greater possibility that it won't be a good match\nA and that in itself shows hundreds changes it used to be back in the Nineteen fifties the average couple who married knew each other for only six months to date that would be a huge risk factor for divorce because marriage is so much more individualized requires so much more negotiations\nSo when people move in together too fast nowadays they often don't proceed to marriage at all\nAnd stuff to be something I've seen anecdotal reporting on and maybe you know if there's data on how often this happens real cohabiting couples human economical you can secure conditions breaking up but they can't afford to rent their circle happening post breakup is that something we know about how widespread it is\nI don't know how widespread that is a again I've seen the anecdotal account to and as a historian I Know that this happened a lot during the great depression I've interviewed people I'm a old stirs\nA I live in the past about living in the great depression some of them talked about putting a curtain down the living room because they couldn't afford to to move out onto the divorce rate fell madly in the great depression but that didn't mean that marriage is better\nWell let's look at the baby boomers as I understand that there are the ones who who drove these higher divorce rate how are they doing now is the age [noise] well\nUm I think that it's true that the baby boomers to drive it and I think that part of that\nWas because um they came of age in a period when gender roles were changing very very rapidly and women's expectations were rising more quickly about those changes than men's behavior\nAnd I think that since that time I think one of the reasons that divorce rates stabilized is that men and women are adjusting to the new set of rules of marriage and\nUm we for example no that men are up until the Nineteen eighties if I'm a woman had more education than her husband a that was a risk factor for divorce is a um if she earned more than her husband and that's a bit factor for divorce\nBoth those things are not coup so marriage is formed a since the Nineteen nineties and that's another reason why young people I think in doing so well the baby boomers have had um many of them have had the voices earlier and then gone on to uh other marriage is some very successful but\nOnce you have divorced once it's easier to voice again and we saw between Nineteen Ninety and plenty hands we saw\nA tripling of the voices of couples age sixty five year old and a doubling of the voices of couples age fifty and older that's leveled off now um and there I think there's some disagreement a demographer Philip Cohen who is a much much\nMore skilled at at numbers and I said we're going to see a continuing declining rate of divorce among older people I'm not\nSure about that because older divorces are different than younger voices older divorces\nAre usually because we've just grown apart he's gotten an empty shell marriage and people nowadays are not willing to put up with that and they have lots of alternative is outside of it\nSo I Would say that anybody getting married now should recognize that marriage nowadays our expectations of it are such that there is yet your chances of void go down the longer you're married but they don't disappear and it's really important to keep working on that relationship\nIn a way that might not have been in the past when people just felt like they didn't have any alternative for\nTalk of the ... professor at evergreen state college in
