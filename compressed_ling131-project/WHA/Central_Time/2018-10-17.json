for the Los Angeles times talking about this week's political news want to hear a couple of your calls on the use deficit and budget issues Laurie is with us and burning county Lori Hi\nHi I'm thank you for taking my call I mean for the past ... years forty years workers' wages have been stagnant uh the wealthy have then becoming ever more wealthy we are it's a huge ... the largest inequality and the ... century\nPractically if workers had been receiving wages ... wage increases in the last fifty years the Social Security fund would not be getting in trouble we never we never talk about where the money has been going in these conversations and also for McConnell to say that ... percent of\nThe budget goes to these entitlement programs well Social Security and Medicare are taken out of our paychecks it's not coming out of the general fund so thank you Flora\nCharlie Hi Hi thanks for taking my call I Believe when we were discussing the tax cuts\nThat was opposed they assumed the GDP of three percent the fact that the fact that we're now getting that GDP oh four percent increase to revenues in through taxation isn't that going to mitigate\nThe cost of the cost of the tax cut and decrease the deficit overall\nThanks for the call before I Move on from the deficit issue I David I'm Laurie connect to the economy to the deficit saying workers not getting pay increases that's been taking a bite out of Social Security money coming in Charlie saying the hope that an improved economy brings in more revenue that's going to lower the deficit both arguments that are out there\n[noise] yeah I mean you know it's true that by and large the wages for average workers um peaked in the late Nineteen seventies that have been pretty stagnant sense so uh that has definitely been a problem uh and it has affected the a a Social Security I'm a financing\nFor you know rapid economic growth we haven't actually had four percent at least not on an on an annual basis or and\nMost a forecast suggests that will be back to about two percent next year so uh you know if the economy grows really really fast\nThen everything financially gets much better uh but uh you know that's a bit like a family I'm saying you know if I get a really big will a pay increase or I I'll be able to afford this a larger house it it's a risky to bet on it\nThanks a lot for your cause we're talking about the top stories and national politics David louder is with us and David I Want to move on to see more issues before our conversation ends you wrote recently\nAbout the Senate US Senate races in the mid term elections I talk about the tough challenge for Democrats were hoping to gain those magic two seats to get a majority\n[noise] yeah I mean most of the uh races that are up for grabs this year uh they're thirty five Senate seats up for grabs this here but most of them are are pretty one sided the ones that are actually competitive\nA are mostly a seats the Democrats hold an extremely a conservative states are fairly conservative states and\nUh they uh they're not doing very well so uh unlike the house where Democrats have a really good chance of a retaking the majority\nIn the Senate and Democrats um maybe possibly I thought they get ... bought a lucky break a might be able to win the majority but more likely or they may\nActually lose a seat or two on a on balance or because you're dealing with um you know some pretty conservative places like West Virginia and North Dakota a and I'm a Montana Indiana and Missouri uh where\nUh it's hard for a Democrat to win and their chances of ah of defending all of those\nUm I incumbent Democratic senators in states that Trump carried a that's a tall order\nAnd I've seen a lot of list including yours of races to watch that could slip I I'm not seeing a lot of people but Wisconsin we've got incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin being challenged by Republican state senator Leah Vukmir a poll showing Baltimore had but Donald Trump won the state or ... or Ron Johnson one for Republicans for a second time in twenty sixteen\nWisconsin do does seem to be on people's radar\nDoesn't a year ago a Republican consultants were saying I'm Tammy Baldwin's trouble this is a this is a state that we should be able to when you don't hear that very much from a Republican strategist anymore\nOh and they're hoping that um that they can hold on to 'em you know the Governor Walker can hold on and to get reelected but\nIt doesn't seem I'm terribly likely is that um that a\nFull but it's going to lose and you know Wisconsin has probably the the biggest uh eighty a logical a separation between those two senators of any state in the country it's a remarkable thing how different ah Baldwin and Ron Johnson are are so the the idea that the state\nCould elect a\nTo such a very different uh people into successive elections is um [noise] uh it's pretty um startling but that's the nature of the state\nNow that elections twenty days away I don't want to be that guy bought the presidential elections coming up and twenty twenty President Trump or has a ways off he's already had some impressive what sounded like impressive fundraising numbers over a hundred million dollars for that campaign is that something we usually see this far out\nNo Trump is definitely started fundraising earlier than uh other uh presidents have\nAdded he's had quite a lot of success as you noted but you know raising money was never really got to be his problem and he's he's going to have the money that he needs to ah Ron ... the I think the question with\nThe um ah Trump's re election will be whether he can hold onto a those voters are in places like Wisconsin who uh put them over the top ... and\nI think that's very much an open question you know you have to assume if if the guy won once that he can win twice but uh but that victory in two thousand six team a was a very very narrow\nWhen you know a few tens of thousands of votes in just a handful of states including Wisconsin uh who would have\nLooked at the other way so uh it's gonna be a very um a closely fought contest again I think that it's certainly as it looks right now things could change but um\nI you know you'd have to bet on a um and then another a high profile high decibel lots of shouting ah but I'm very polarized election\nWe've been there for now David thanks a lot for joining us today\nMy pleasure good to be with you\nDavid louder Washington bureau chief for the Los Angeles times he was with us for our weekly look at some of the top stories in national politics you can civil weigh in on your question for you and this edition of the week in Washington are you worried about the deficit the federal deficit gone up in a recent fiscal report\nA so again it's all of those factors that come into play that together mean less money and and more difficult decisions\nIs there a fear of a downward spiral off your students was tuition leading the program cops parents and prospective students here about those ... maybe that's not at the top of our list\n[noise] well that certainly is something that campuses are talking about it and it has gradually been happening you you've heard about you W Steven's point talking more dramatically about cutting majors 'em all campuses to some degree have\nHave made adjustments through the years when they have lower interest in certain majors they may they may redirect faculty\nUm but not necessarily dropping a major but redirecting them to areas where there's there's more demand um but certainly like for example you WN a there have been classes that had been dropped you know that would give you a concentration like for example in\nIn a jazz performance in the school of of music um again it follows what the enrollment numbers are it follows what the demand is for the workforce um politics to some degree\nUm stem field growth so it's it's a lot of a lot of factors that come into play\nOr to higher education reporter Karen Herzog from the Milwaukee Journal sentinel talking about some of the budget challenges facing campuses around the state and how they're reacting to those challenges roles hearing you W Oshkosh having financial issues are what are they doing to to try to stay afloat there\nWell actually cautious lost over a hundred positions or faculty positions over the last four years so they've been experiencing some of the same pressures that you do you'll am has experienced\nUm they are also have lost about Eighteen hundred undergraduates in the last five years although there in enrollment is is slightly up this year but again you know those Eighteen hundred undergrads that they didn't have enroll that's ten million dollars in lost revenue\nUm the other factor that's coming into play is when you improve graduation rates to get more students through quicker that's fewer students that are paying tuition for you and you have to replace him in the next class\nUm gosh I think is also looking for um perhaps\nReducing the number of classes offered in some areas um increasing at least temporarily the workload teaching hours in the College of letters and science um although that's supposed to be temporary um they they they are also looking at non renewal of ah like adjunct instructor contracts\nUm there hasn't really been any talk of any layoffs I'm On any campuses per se um it's mostly attrition and and freezing physicians when people leave\nMostly been talking about tuition revenue here you mentioned earlier another part of the story is the support can you talk about trends in space\nWild bunch of years\nWhile state support has certainly not um increased or with any in any significance there's been some targeted increases in funding um but overall uh that that trend has definitely been less states support more reliance on tuition revenue\nOr what the state budget to buy a new budget discussions starting up a in a few months\nOf course this is a big topic of of discussion in a in a big topic for the ... system to try to win the support of a state lawmakers to hopefully increased funding and and also perhaps a take a take the ... the tuition freeze off the table that tuition has been frozen for undergrad residents are for six years now\nAnd that of course is a a big loss\nOf of additional revenue if if the campuses can't raise tuition um and that of course as you know was prompted by five or six years of of five point five percent increases in a row prior to charge the phrase so there are a lot of factors on the table\nAs you report on this but what's the sense you get from these campuses is is okay we've got a rough patch will make some tweaks to get through is it this is an existential crisis or somewhere in between\n[noise] it depends on who you ask 'em at U. W. M. for example a administrators will say you know we're strategically managing this you know where where they keep smart decisions based on you know interest in academic areas and higher demand majors\nFaculty on the other hand at you WN are very concerned about whether I'm losing a talented faculty and replacing them with adjunct instructors who do not do research could put the uh the the are one research that is the highest category of research a a status that\nThey gained in two thousand Fifteen that that could be in jeopardy\nIf but if the labor force is is a wrote it at the university\nAnd once upon a time I'm thinking back to probably Tommy Thompson you're as governor or there might be a blue ribbon commission to kind of take these problems apart or maybe look at some fundamental changes is anybody talking in that way big picture we need to re think take another look at the mission and funding sources for you W system\nI certainly hear that from faculty members there there are a lot of faculty across the assistant who are concerned that there isn't a big picture look at this that there does need to be a blue ribbon commission that's been to before I'm\nI'm there hasn't been any discussion of that happening it to the state level or W system calling for such a thing you know their task forces that are that are\nDeveloped you know as needed to look at certain things in particular campuses but a blue ribbon commission it's not something that I've heard mentioned a as a priority or as something that we could be seeing and the next fiscal year\nIn our last a few moments used is something that is affecting the student experience at campus is like you W market you know ... some of the others we've talked about\nI think that it's hard to say it it it varies depending on departments and if you're in a department that has strong enrollment um there's probably you know the same number of classes that you're used to seeing in departments letters and scientists for example if you have a loss of faculty um\nYou're going to have a cut in the number of class sections offered her there may be fewer courses there may not be the higher level courses they may be rotated to only once a year or rather than twice a year which could slow down your path to the degree I'm so there there are things that students may notice but it's going to be specific areas that had been harder heads\nWill be there for now Karen thanks a lot for joining us today thank you for having me\nThat's Karen Herzog higher education reporter for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel she joined us today to give us an update on the financial health of the W system and how some campuses around the state or dealing with the budget challenges coming up the ... bucks tip off the regular\nWe can expect from the team and how far they might go stay with us here on central time\n[noise] to society islands a French Polynesia is a late winter destination I'm double NPR travel ... team but Brickell there traveled to offer a seven day cruise important the sale is just in motor ... we'll explore the white sand beaches South Pacific lifestyle and Polynesian cuisine of heating\nBora Bora and four other island it's a French Polynesia improve February twenty seven through march ... details available and WNPR dot org slash travel [noise]\nContributors to WPRI include mark court Toyota and the international owl center YouTube can help ensure the future of WNPR with your business sponsorship go to W.

population health Institute she also oversees the group covering Wisconsin which helps ... residents with insurance plans Donna welcome back to central time\nTo be with you well it's a moving target in some ways but right now as of today what this coverage for pre existing conditions look like right now in Wisconsin [noise]\nWell it looks the same as it looks at the national level because uh the protections extended under the Affordable CARE Act or the same nationally I'm for it with and all the states so insurance plans they're not able to exclude people based on preexisting conditions\nAnd um people cannot be face differential pricing based on preexisting conditions\nSo we've got this national lawsuit Wisconsin as part of it are saying we Affordable Care act is unconstitutional uh hypothetically if a court were to strike down the whole thing what then happens to this uh the preexisting condition coverage mandates\nWell it'd be a substantial change without a doubt if the if it ... goes away on the ... thing conditions\nCase would would go away along with it\nAnd that would affect a lot of people on it would affect really virtually everybody in the state in some way the estimates are that about twenty five percent of the adult population in the state or about eight hundred and fifty thousand a adults in our state have some kind of excluded preexisting condition\nAnd people think of large conditions like cancer but this can include really common conditions as my depression diabetes those kinds of things and a lot of people either half\nOf them are at higher or at high risk for developing these kinds of conditions\nSo if the existing law goes away and we don't have anything in its place then insurance plans will have\nThe ability to exclude um those people with those conditions from coverage or substantially increase the price for a plan for people who have those conditions\n\nYou know that this was happening at the time he said you were five ... five I have

to some of the game what does that sound like that's\nThe dream come true for me more more than being able to return to myself to be able to share it with my daughter because my dad never had the chance I mean you were super into the team but the team was never in the playoffs when I was a kid\nSo yeah to see her light up and celebrate a victory in just like fuel the crazy energy in place\nSo you went to a game this weekend and I was lucky enough in stupidly bought tickets regain this weekend well you've got to see them when I see them when notch or of any in your face\nUm look good it was an amazing experience and the energy and electricity in that stadium was so overwhelming especially at the end obviously when they won but it's like it didn't die down the entire game\nIs really cool when I when I went to the divisional series and saw him when I finished writing to look for the whole time stadium is loaded one in one everybody was singing and cheering and\nWonder if it's just it sounds like the stars\nIt's such a cubs fan assured variants that uh you know and even with cubs fans you know they have a huge drug between World Series but it's not like they weren't making the playoffs right right I mean they've gotten to see their team play in October ... first for him so much what if the ...\nLose my mind I Will be in the world series with my family\nAt any cost and dare I say what if they don't make it to the world series this year there's always next year [laughter] that's the thing about this team I feel like this is maybe sustainable like the the big contributors on this team are gonna still be here next year in the year after the so we'll see maybe they're going to be\nGood for a while I mean they say the season out saying oh we're still rebuilding clearly they rebuilt yet if they can build on from this\nThing\nCalled Barry is a WPN producer ... super fan that Fred thank you so much thanks for having me\nWisconsin I think they co production of Wisconsin Public radio and Wisconsin Public television in partnership with the Wisconsin humanity count on additional support comes from law Peterson of apple can find more Wisconsin line that Wisconsin Neistat Oregon on Sunday Morning\n\nLast the brewers\nNow Packers fans are known to be devoted even repeatedly ranking number one in the Forbes List of NFL best fans and what makes a fan happier than getting to feel a part of the team joining us now are to Green Bay Packer fans whose work beginning with painting murals on fences surrounding the stadium has made them even more a part of the pack\nSpencer young as a graphic designer an artist from shocked in vain stats is a graphic designer and Peter from Green Bay together they've been painting your old on fences surrounding limbo field for years now they've been dubbed the unofficial Packers artists are the Green Bay press Gazette Spencer welcome to central time\nHey Rob thanks for having me and then thanks for joining us\nYeah thanks for having us\nWell let's hear the story you're both fans obviously you're both artists Spencer how did you end up painting these murals on Lombardi avenue\nA it's a quite a funny story I I'm actually left my job but it was an office desk job and just it wasn't for me you know it's it's fun working on the computer but my real passion was painting and I pursued this dream and\nFortunately a month went by and dizzying called me and said I there's an opportunity to paint the Packers fence and\nI thought he was lying to me because I remember growing up and that was the one thing I remember it was a press handler the previous Packer fans painter doing that every year and I just told myself man that'd be so cool to do and here we are I mean I'm living my dream right now\nAnd again this is a lot of pressure this is something that basically every single Packer fan is going to come in the on game day much less the rest of the week did you feel a lot of weight on your shoulders when you did that first mural\nOr the first one level but just because the only had two weeks notice\nToo that I'm so\nTo come with the design execute it under twenty four hours\nI'm repeated one day but I could do that because we had to do it with a little a nerve wracking but I mean the first year we feel like they knocked out of the art then every year after that I just got better\nAnd let's say let's get the dimensions of the fence Spencer 'cause I think people like by the ... a little thing along the side of the big it's\nA large fence if I remember correctly it's about sixty six feet long and six feet high\nSo that's how then do you plan out something like that so it's you know well proportion at that like\nWe both kind of have our own little methods to use a sponsor used like a grid stunts that are printed a large format sided and all that my proportions are accurate but um as each year we kind of perfect our our work ethic and I'm\nThe best thing that can do to make sure that one day and say isn't it yeah go ahead\nWhy does happy one day\nAnd that was the the request of the fence on the first year and we kind of thought that challenged and we just want to keep doing that same alec every year because that Saturday the for the first day lives just one huge party\nHave thought I was just kind of a ... just one big fun time\nAnd Spencer there's a different theme each year what was your theme for this season\nI think the big give away was the Hundred Years' you're celebrating you've got to go big so ah just planning between ... and myself and actually the owner of the fence we decided that it would be cool to not only step it up but stepping up big in previous years we painted about two players\nOn the fence or this year we painted heat [laughter] so that was a challenge I didn't think it would be done but the only thing that sets us up now we've got all do this previous years fence and come up with some better next year so I'm kind of worrying about it but I I'm sure we'll be able to get something done\nNow the fans has its own Twitter page of tweets at Packers fence Xena what kind of response or online or in person do you get from the fans\nI mean it's just bond with unique which is kind of fun to see but it's I mean it's a lot of the ... and I'm just fan can robbery see I'm I'm just hoping that you can also that's kind of interacting\nAnd really appreciate what we do and that's not going to get our time to do this for the what we see other fan reaction and ... it's kind of makes us feel good about the organization and back well\nIt's actually understand you've done other or both of you I think I've done some other Packers themed art on what kind of what kind of stuff have you done\nA it ranges a it's it's totally random actually with the projects that I've done a actually this season I'll be painting for sure to Packer players cleats for weeks Thirteen so my cause my cleats\nUm I've done work for other Packer players and then just Packer fans in general so it's it's always a keeping me busy\nAnd ... do you get responses from the team and the organization itself\n[noise] [laughter] yeah we have I mean are we a mark Murphy stopped off the phone and talk to us for a few seconds kind of the failure appreciate or going hum so that's pretty good to see that are here that the average president um but yeah I mean players reach out and just won a good response kind of ...\nSpencer ... this is like an artist dream of canvas the you're you're doing something that a lot of people are going to see is going to be hard to top this you're young you got along artistic career out of you\nYeah uh each year I right before I we paint the fence I I just say to myself like how how are we going to do this how are you going to do this and a each year we just managed to you know make something out that you know and each year that's our plan and that's our intention is to make something that\nThe Packer fan community will love and appreciate and hopefully more people become Packer fans cause of it\nAnd then what is it like for you as an artist being able to combine your two labs are the art and uh your Packer fan dumb\nIt's great I mean it's a dream come true it's kind of whatever or hope to do um especially at the scale is supposed to I guess so but we really love it um we all all day and I are each year and kind of scale for the sake of brought me that's great\nSpencer you're you mentioned that you're already thinking about next year I'm sure you have don't have a lock down you wouldn't want to tip your your hand too early even if you did a book that said what are you looking ad for inspiration is there a moment I think there was a hail Rogers' theme a couple of years ago I'm assuming that was\nInspired by one of his Hail Mary pass is\nA correct that um they ... was inspired by the previous game with the motor city miracle so it had to pay homage to that and then coincidentally that that was the first home game opener was against the lion so it's kind of a slow burn on lions fans there and have to relive that moment when they come to limbo\nAnd Zane or leave us with ah some thoughts on on your Packer themed art to leave leave a message for your your fans who are watching your murals each year\nWas a thought so do these big fences goes a long way and we used to help bring new designs on ... avenue and all that ... that that experience\nAll right ... thanks good luck to you and to the team of course this season thank you\nAnd Spencer thanks for joining us in our studio in Green Bay thanks Rob really appreciate your time we've been talking to Spencer young graphic designer an artist from Stockton and dizzying stats graphic designer and painter from Green Bay\nSo low um thank you for taking my call um I feel\nBad now everything is fast people just like everything quick and fast\nAs for me I Love going to the mailbox checking my mail and getting letters and they also love writing them because when you write a letter you put so much more into it could take the time and when I received letters I can feel\nWhat the person is genuinely put into the writing more than I could from you know from an email and I will always be I Will always be doing that it will always be looking forward to my mail and they'll be always\nReady to just sit down and answer letters and send cars and I love to put the cars out just leave him out so I can look at them and read them\nAnd do do you have people that you are you actually correspond with you write them they re you back back and forth so\nLoosely but loosely\nFantastic Jude thanks a lot for sharing that story and Susan that idea of you know when you read a biography is a famous people are always writing these awesome letters back and forth and that's something that a lot of us were just totally missing out on not Judy she's doing it but a lot of us don't have that\nYeah and I mean like I said in my story\nNowadays famous website called letters of know that kind of have all these intimate letters of of people throughout history and I just don't think that emails I Know it has the same brain on\nYou know because it's so exciting to the what somebody's handwriting looked like and what kind of paper they were using um and to see those ... and there I mean not that makes it real and when it's just on a computer that just doesn't seem as um as much of an intimate glimpse into their lives\nAre thanks for calling in June and she's also mentioned Susan ... anticipation like you're going to the mail and there could be something cool in there and I kind of say when I hear the male falling we've got a male fall when I hear the male fall in there is a part of me to think\nWell maybe there's something cooler there isn't because I don't read letters I don't get letters which I Know it's going to be advertising circulars and you know the utility bill for something like that part of the fun doing but he's a cool might be their\nExactly I mean nobody gets excited when they get an email an email just means something that you're going to have to work and that you're gonna have to think about and replied to add something to get through whereas a piece of mail it's it's really exciting you can look at it you can cherish it there's no rush to reply\nBecause somebody's waiting on you um you can take your time like dude didn't really think about what you want to say\nGo to another caller now sue is with us and cast bill sue hello\nHi thanks for taking my call I really enjoy writing letters are probably right for five

with the sharing that with us and Susan both shoe and Jude mentioned something did you have a life being really fast the letter writing and reading is a way to slow down\nYeah exactly I mean think about the last time he sat down to write a card or a letter I mean you're going to be taking out a paper and a lot of people who I spoke to thought about the idea of ... thinking about the person while you're writing it you know picturing their face while you're writing them a letter and it's kind of a really beautiful moment to take that time\nOut of your busy day in and sit there and and really give yourself over to this person while you're writing a card or a letter\nThanks a lot for the call and Susan in your piece you wrote about some kind of famous people who are still letter writers and you mentioned a public radio free ... the author David ... so what do you have to say about writing letters\nOh yeah I was so fun to talk to him I mean I'm a huge fan of his writing and so um knowing that he was really into letters he spoke to me um and I mean obviously he was very funny so I was laughing the whole time um but yeah he loves writing letters he writes them to all of its fans he writes them to boyfriend\nAnd I thought this was really interesting he writes them to everybody that he works with on a book tour so if I had a book store if there's people who are helping him get set up he writes them a letter and he said basically said nobody else does that um and he just said it's really classy real males classy and he likes to be thought of as classy and\nWhen he receives real doubt from people it's meaningful to him and so he sends a back\nRoom another caller now Karen is with us in La Crosse Karen Hi\nHi I'm I just want to add I Do think it's very special when these days especially to get a card in the mail that handwritten I I keep cards um better special to me I still have heard\nFrom my grandparents you know from before email existed\nLook through those and see the hand that ... that they said hey with with their signature then and it's just it's just a very warm feelings to remember them that way and to see their own penmanship\nAnd are these things are going to hang onto a for a long time all family Mentos maybe\nOh yeah my kids don't have to you know Clinton that out and I\nAnd that's their problem Sterritt thank you so much for sharing that with this though I mean if those kids keep it I mean this is pure gold for people who decided to get into genealogy and family histories of Susan ... might be a reason to save especially some of those older more special a card especially for people who have who have passed on\nYeah I mean you can really get a glimpse into their personality and and see what they're thinking about it and it

louder Washington bureau chief from Los Angeles times talking about this week's political news one here a couple of your calls on the deficit and budget issues Laurie is with us and Vernon county Lori Hi\nHi I'm thank you for taking my call it for the past ... years forty years workers' wages have been stagnant\nUh the wealthy have then becoming ever more wealthy we are at a huge than the largest inequality and the ... century practically if workers had been receiving\nWages ... wage increases in the last fifty years the Social Security fund\nWould not be getting in trouble we never we never talk about where the money has been going in these conversations and now for McConnell to say that seven eight percent of the budget goes to these entitlement programs well Social Security and Medicare are taken out of our paychecks it's not coming out of the general fund from thank you Flora\nThanks for the call on a brown Charlie in Milwaukee now Charlie Hi\nHi thanks for taking my call I Believe when we were discussing the tax cuts that was opposed\nThey assumed the GDP of three percent the fact that the fact that we're now getting that GDP oh four percent and increased revenues in through taxation is that going to mitigate\nThe cost of the cost of the of tax cuts and decrease the deficit overall\nThanks for the call before I Move on from the deficit issue or David I'm Laurie connect to the economy to the deficit saying a workers not getting pay increases that's been taking a bite out of Social Security money coming in Charlie saying the hope that an improved economy brings in more revenue that's going to lower the\n[noise] yeah I mean you know it's true that by and large the wages for average workers\nUm peaked in the late Nineteen seventies that have been pretty stagnant sense so uh that has definitely been a problem uh and it has affected the a a Social Security I'm a financing\nFor you know rapid economic growth we haven't actually had four percent at least not on it up on an annual basis or and\nMost a forecast\nSuggests that will be back to about two percent next year so uh you know if the economy grows really really fast then everything financially gets much better uh but uh you know that's a bit like a family I'm\nSaying you know if I get a really big will a pay increase I I'll be able to afford this a larger house it it's a risky to bet on it\nThanks a lot for your cause we're talking about the top stories of national politics David louder is with us and David I Want to move on to see more issues before our conversation and you wrote recently\nAbout the Senate US Senate races in the mid term elections I talk about the tough challenge for Democrats were hoping to gain those magic two seats to get a majority\n[noise] yeah I mean most of the uh races that are up for grabs this year\nOr they're thirty five Senate seats up for grabs us here but most of them are are pretty one sided the ones that are actually competitive or are mostly a seats the Democrats hold an extremely a conservative states are fairly conservative states\nAnd uh they uh they're not doing very well so uh unlike the house where Democrats have a really good chance of a retail in the majority in the Senate\nAnd Democrats um\nMaybe possibly I thought they get ... bought a lucky break a might be able to win the majority but more likely they may\nActually lose a seat or two on a on balance or because you're dealing with the you know some pretty conservative places like West Virginia and North Dakota a and I'm a Montana Indiana and Missouri uh where uh\nIt's hard for a Democrat to win and their chances of ah of defending all of those um\nI incumbent Democratic senators in states that Trump carried\nA that's a tall order\nAnd I've seen a lot of list including yours of races to watch that could slip I I'm not seeing a lot of people but Wisconsin we've got incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin being challenged by Republican state senator Leah Vukmir a poll showing Baltimore had but Donald Trump on the state\nOr a Ron Johnson one for Republicans for a second time in twenty sixteen Wisconsin do does seem to be on people's radar [noise] doesn't\nA year ago a Republican consultants were saying I'm Tammy Baldwin's trouble this was a this is a state that we should be able to when you don't hear that very much from a Republican strategist anymore are they um ah and\nThey're hoping that um that they can hold on to 'em you know the Governor Walker can hold on and uh get reelected but\nIt doesn't seem I'm terribly likely is that um that a Bull Run it's going to lose and you know Wisconsin has uh probably the\nThe biggest uh eighty a logical a separation between those two senators of any state in the country it's a remarkable thing how different ah Baldwin and Ron Johnson are ah so the the idea that the state could elect a\nTo such a very different uh people into successive elections is\nUm startling but that's the nature of the states\nNow that elections twenty days away I don't want to be that guy bought the presidential elections coming up and twenty twenty President Trump or has a ways off he's already had some impressive what sound like impressive fundraising numbers over a hundred million dollars for that campaign is that something we usually see this far out\nNo a Trump is definitely started fundraising earlier than the other uh presidents have\nAdded he's had quite a lot of success as you noted but you know raising money was never really got to be his prop he's he's going to have the money that he needs to ah Ron ... the you know I think that question with the um\nUh Trump's re election will be whether he can hold on to\nThose voters are in places like Wisconsin who ah put them over the top\n... and I think that's very much an open question you know you have to assume if if the guy one wants that he can win twice but\nUh but that victory in two thousand six seen a was a very very narrow when you know a few tens of thousands of votes in just a handful of states including Wisconsin ... would have um flip to the other way so\nUh it's gonna be a very a a closely fought contest again I think I mean that would certainly as it looks right now things could change but I'm\nA you know you'd have to have that on a I'm a ... another a high profile high decibel lots of shouting ah but I'm very polarized election\nWe've been there for now David thanks a lot for joining us today\nMy pleasure good to be with you\nDavid louder Washington bureau chief for the Los Angeles times he was with us for our weekly look at some of the top stories in national politics\nIs there a fear of a downward spiral off your students was tuition leading the program cops parents and prospective students here about those costs and maybe that's not at the top of our list\n[noise] well that certainly is something that campuses\nThey're talking about it and it has gradually been happening you you've heard about you know the Steven's point talking more dramatically about cutting majors 'em all campuses to some degree have have made adjustments through the years when they have lower interest in certain majors they may\nThey may redirect faculty um but not necessarily dropping a major but redirecting them to areas where there's there's more demand\nUm but certainly like for example you WN there have been\nClashes that had been dropped you know that would give you a concentration like for example in in a jazz performance in the school of of music um ... again it follows what the enrollment numbers are it follows what the demand is for the workforce um politics to some degree\nUm stem field growth so it's it's a lot of a lot of factors that come into play\nOr to higher education reporter Karen Herzog from the Milwaukee Journal sentinel talking about some of the budget challenges facing campuses around the street and how they're reacting to those challenges roles hearing you W Oshkosh having financial issues but what are they doing to try to stay afloat there\nWell cautious lost over a hundred positions a faculty positions over the last four years so they've been experiencing some of the same pressures that you W O M has experienced\nUm they are also have lost about Eighteen hundred undergraduates in the last five years although there in enrollment is is slightly up this year but again you know those Eighteen hundred undergrads that they didn't have\nEnroll that's ten million dollars in lost revenue um the other factor that's coming into play is when you improve graduation rates to get more students to quicker bats fewer students that are paying you know tuition for you and you have to replace him in the next class\nUm gosh I think is also looking for um perhaps reducing the number of classes offered in some areas um increasing at least temporarily the workload teaching hours in the colleges letters and science um although that's supposed to be temporary\nUm they ... they are also looking at nine or ... of uh like adjunct instructor contracts um there hasn't really been any talk of any layoffs I'm On any campuses per se\nUm it's mostly attrition and and freezing physicians when people leave\nWe mostly been talking about tuition revenue here you mentioned earlier another part of the story is the support can you talk about trends in St support for these campuses over ... years\nWell state support has certainly not um increased or with any in any significance there's been some targeted increases in funding um but overall uh that that trend has definitely been less states support more reliance on tuition revenue\nOr with the state budget to buy a new budget discussions starting up a in a few months of course this is a big topic of discussion in a in a big topic for the ... system to try to win the support of a state lawmakers to hopefully increased funding and and also perhaps a\nTake a take the ... the tuition freeze off the table the tuition has been frozen for undergrad residents are for six years now and that of course is a a big loss of of additional revenue\nUm and that of course is you know was prompted by five or six years of of five point five percent increases in a row prior to charge for the phrase so there are a lot of factors on the table\nAs you report on this what's the sense you get from these campuses is is okay we've got a rough patch will make some tweaks them get through is it this is an existential crisis or somewhere in between\n[noise] it depends on who you ask 'em at the un for example a administrators will say you know we're strategically managing this you know where we're making smart decisions based on you know interest in academic areas in higher demand majors\nFaculty and the other hand at the un are very concerned about whether I'm losing a talented faculty and replacing them with adjunct instructors who do not do research could put the uh the the are one\nResearch that is the highest category of research a status that they gained in two thousand Fifteen that that could be in jeopardy\nIf but if the labor force is is a wrote it at the university\nAt once upon a time I'm thinking back to probably Tommy Thompson you're as governor or there might be a blue ribbon commission to kind of take these problems apart or maybe look at some fundamental changes is anybody talking in that way big picture we need to re think take another look at the mission and funding sources for you W system\nI certainly hear that from faculty members there there are a lot of faculty across the system who are concerned that there isn't a big picture look at this that there does need to be a blue ribbon commission that spent two before I'm\nI'm there hasn't been any discussion of that happening at the state level or W system calling for such a thing you know their task forces that are that are developed you know as needed to look at certain things in particular campuses\nBut a blue ribbon commission it's not something that I've heard mentioned a as a priority or something that we could be seeing in the next a typical year\nIn our last a few moments is this something that is affecting the student experience ... was like you W ... some of the others we've talked about\nI think that it's hard to\nSay it it it varies depending on departments and if you're in a department that has strong enrollment um there's probably you know the same number of classes that you're used to seeing in departments letters and scientists for example if you have a loss of faculty um you're going to have a a cut in the number of class\nSections offered her there may be fewer courses there may not be the higher level courses they may be rotated to only once a year or rather than twice a year which could slow down your path to the degree I'm so there there are things that students may notice but it's going to be specific areas that had been harder hit\nWill be there for now Karen thanks a lot for joining us today thank you for having me\nThat's Karen Herzog higher education reporter for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel she joined us to me to give us an update on the financial health of the W system and how some campuses around the state or dealing with the budget challenges\nComing up the ... bucks tip off the regular season
