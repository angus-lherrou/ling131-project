in\nKitchens all over the world will find out more about Tupperware its origin story coming out\nFirst after a month long stalemate Canada is signing onto a three way deal to replace the north

all three countries Megan ... covers trade for Politico and she's with us now to talk about the deal Megan welcome back to central time\nThanks for having me\nSo it's a new deal with a new name is it really that big a departure from NAFTA or is this just kind of an update that people have been looking for\nI think it's a little bit of both it's definitely\nAn update and people on all sides of the spectrum saying you know we needed this update not to have been called sort of an old lady of trade agreements instead of modernization is good but there's also some changes I mean there's the Trump Administration and all three countries do deserves recognition for up making some tough compromises in different areas and\nMaking some changes to the agreement that I think we'll ...\nWe'll dig into some of the changes in general right now I Want to key in on one here in Wisconsin and give a listen to President Trump he specifically mentioned Wisconsin dairy farmers when he announced this today and the lack of access some of had the Canadian dairy markets there's a lesson\nWe've opened it up to our farmers so the folks up in Wisconsin I I'll tell you what I Want to Wisconsin and I went to Iowa Joni knows better than anybody right as Scott Walker who I think it's a fantastic governor talks about it all the time\nOur farmers were not treated properly by Kevin and now they're going to be treated with respect\nA diving into the details make and there was one class in particular of dairy products that Canada had had raised tariffs on a lot of tension here in Wisconsin that is one of them was one of the sticking points and it sounds like that's something that got ironed out in this agreement\n[noise] absolutely I think you're referring to class that are across southern code I think that that meant so candidate to drop the system which is a big win for us dairy farmers and the other dairy update is that um in general that Canadian dairy market is open is going to be open by about three point six percent\nBecause it's a combination they you know as you say and I just heard on that recording Trump said over and over for months that those were going to be that there was going to be a make or break part of the deal and Canada did agree to make those changes and that should be I'm I'm guessing welcome to\nYou could join in at eight hundred six more two one two three four\nMarcia Bryant is a professor of English and distinguished teaching scholar at the University of Florida She's taught classes on domestic life the Nineteen fifties and she uh co teaches a class on the impact of materials on society she wrote an article for the conversation called from swag swag the story of Earl Tupper is fantastic plastics\nMarsha thanks a lot for joining us\nYou're quite welcome and thanks for having me well your piece a solved one question I had were Tupperware got its name and it was made by a guy named pepper\n[noise] it was indeed and ah like Kramer says something people just don't want to let go of what made the Tupperware so special [noise] well I think that's a good question um I think a couple of things at first I think it's really cool if you look\nAt it it's pretty it has shapes um and it actually ended up in the museum first so people like to look at it\nAnd then people like to use it and I it's it's functional it fits in your refrigerator your catch on me and my family never sold that but I'm kind of addicted to having now so it's pretty and you can do things with that now this\nEarl Tupper he's working for dupont and they're trying to figure out our we've got all this plastic waste and slag uh and and so what does he do how does he tried to figure out what to do with it\n[noise] well I'm a ... couple of things I think at first of all he he was a self educated person so I think\nPart of why he could figure out what she might want to do it that if you read a lot she read a lot of literature he went to trade fair's he talked a lot to women he asked women in kitchens\nHow could your life be easier said when he started working um at the dupont affiliate they they would let sample makers take stuff home\nAnd so she wanted to change the look of it and he wanted to put it in the kitchen so um I thought that was a cool thing dupont dead so it's kind of let people all had their way within the nation\nAnd did I read this right he actually was heating it up on his stove to mold it\nThey they let you take stuff from work home so yeah he did he\nHe had his son help and that sort of the Cayman men's kitchen project you might say and um yeah he decided he would take the pots and play with an himself\nI don't know if history recorded this but I once accidentally melted a tougher we're lid his kitchen lots of smells horrible right\nNow [laughter] and I and actually cringing just thinking of that it's not good\nSo so we ended up with these projects with these ... stay on but you write that the American housekeepers we're not necessarily ready to put their faith in plastic ... how did how did he tried to overcome that\nUm well first of all he had to make it look better uh it had to not look cheap\nUm and I think part of the good design you know why it started off in a museum helped a lot but also uh people were using glass jars to store things I don't know as I Am a Brad Mason jars a different sense of lives were out and so she had to have something that didn't crunch\nYou made dressing if you wanted to put an occur in it that the plastic wouldn't start to break down a and so yeah you figure it out if it could be functional it looked good and you could make the lips tight then you could say you know what it cost a little more but it saves you money so plastic was no longer cheap\nTalking to Marcia Brian ... at the University of Florida about the history of Tupperware and how it went from a home a project melting plastic on the stove to\nA private thing using everybody's kitchens just about a big part of the success story was a woman by the name of brownie wise which was a heck of a name can you tell us about her and her part in a Tupperware story\nShe had a huge part in the story um I mean I think it would probably be frustrating if you're old Tupper and you know he's got a great product but you can't sell it so um she had a lot of hardships up in Detroit um\nShe had a son was a lot of health problems her husband had left her and so she was a door to door sales woman a\nAnd she saw some of this Polly tea or used to be called poly T products and she could see that first of all this is really different and secondly if you can put it in a woman's hands she'll probably by it so she uh\nShe sort of transformed gender roles for a lot of women in the fifties\nAnd at the the state of the arguments the glass jars as an option but also people we're storing food by rubbing tinfoil around it or looming in foil a which is one way to do it or I didn't notice putting by shower caps to food caps too\nIf you lose your may since our lives or something you could put a shower cap of ... you know not not such a good thing and they don't want your toddler to get a hold of that\nThrough through and when you when people say Tupperware people think of Tupperware parties can you talk about how that became such a big way of spreading this new product\n[noise] yeah I um I don't know if you guys says uh looked at the PBS Tupperware film a but but yeah I was just reviewing that because I teach about the fifties but yeah so what so what happened was brownie figure it out you need direct sales and at the time when the different social classes um there were\nThere was a pressure that you know the man had to be the breadwinner you couldn't make the husbands feel he didn't have my mother called provider you know bought her as a provider\nAnd so through a Tupperware party you know you could be found your house wipe your hostess and that was a a role when then we're supposed to have\n'em but you can also be a businesswoman and so the party was a way to get lonely women stock with childcare all day which can be delightful I Will say a bit but it kind of gave women on cars were pretty expensive most families couldn't have to and so they could have socialization that can make a little extra money uh and uh\nThey got to uh you know make their kitchens more functional and and make friends so yeah it became a socially acceptable way from\nA mostly white women that also African American women women in cities rural areas and emergency suburbia so it it kind of created this new way a woman to be and be socially acceptable\nSo you're taught a class called the desperate domesticity the American Nineteen fifties how does a Tupperware itself it into a I guess this new definition of what it was to be a woman homemaker at home that evolved in the post war years\nOh lots of life I have to give a shout out please to Desperate Housewives which is of course fired named the course desperate enough to city um but uh yeah if you think about my favorite character on that show breed to camp\nOr how she comes and she hopes as baskets right with the ... so so you know I'm I think in this desperate to necessity Tupperware\nCreated a um [noise] and it's a new aesthetic for the catch it\nOne then I come up with something to do and as something to show off and you could make your cabinets looked like an art gallery that ... I Wish my cabinets as nice as Rosa Tupperware and these ads\nLike you mentioned the design in the book of Tupperware was maybe as big a part of its success as the function of it\nYeah and and that going back to that you know I Do kitchen experiment I'm not sure if memory Tupper let Earl use the pots after that but um yeah so so what he was able to figure out if you can make it translucent you can make at a um opaque and he wanted to make a different colors\nSo I think um if you've seen enough holding a lovely violets a Tupperware eco water bottle um I've got ... Tupperware around me that people get me because they know I teach Tupperware and they actually get it from the state so\nI don't know what I'll do it without us Tupperware ah but yeah I mean some ... some translucent a\nBright colors pastel colors I think I think it's\nI don't know that people talk about the fifties being a housewife us a directory I don't know that that's true and then in the city's a lot more complicated than people like to assume uh that that I feel like the kitchen certainly became more colorful uh and and the shapes were were pretty they read and um I think that that\nIs up or one of those products like a Kleenex or Xerox copy machines where maybe they were a victim of their own success their brand name became the universe for the type of product\nI think that's really a good question I think yes and no okay so if you could probably tell listeners I'm southern\nAnd so and the southeastern United States as we don't say sneakers would say you know tennis shoes even if it's not for tennis we say Kleenex even at that pops right coke can mean I'm a non Coca Cola product but I don't think that\nYou know you just getting me to think about that I I don't hear people call it my plastic where I've seen people take offense if someone says\nI don't want to disparage on other brand so someone says hey I got this plastic products that you know the store and they call a Tupperware anyone that has ... will say oh no that's not separate where so yeah I mean I guess that's a pretty distinctive marketing to stop it doesn't\nIt doesn't stretch its meaning like say the word clean acts you know any of it when I Lived in Illinois that word was tissue\nBut yeah even down south Tupperware is Tupperware and no other plastic Tupperware how to do that that's that's pretty cool we'll leave it there are Marsha thanks a lot for joining us today I don't really appreciate it you're quite welcome and thanks for having me\nFor now while we figure out we I'm not I'm not helping write it off the wall WNPR figures out what's going on yeah\nThat's that's exactly right and and so at least for the next couple of weeks and that gives us a chance to kind of look at where we are and consider next steps alright\nEr and before we get to calls an election year Mike a lot of a lot of stuff going on here at Wisconsin Public radio and our friends are on the other side of the building or Wisconsin Public television can you talk about some of the things we have to look forward to when it comes to election preview\nSure in addition to the night of and the next morning we'll have lots of coverage then including live coverage on election night and coming up or a couple of specials or the Senate candidate special\nUh will be coming up on October twelfth at seven PM and that'll be on the ideas network and double the P.

plains we fly on\nYes they are and it's a not an accident the airlines have figured out that if for example they\nGo from say thirty four inches of leg room where she pitched thirty one interests of sea of a of a sea fish\nThey can put an extra ruin the airplane for each ten rows they do that too so they say okay this is basically free money let's put it in there and you know people will ah in most of the time just simply accepted as soon as it is but uh\nAgain it's not a a really a good thing for passengers because ... if you're on a short flight\nOkay you can indoor but the longer the flight is the worst gifts and you know there is a potential for a harm to people from a blood clots and so forth\nSo in this bill passed by the house the Senate will have to weigh in on this or how would they regulate this issue of of leg room and and a pitch\n... the um the Congress passes a law but then it's up to the regular the FAA or DOT in this case\nTo um create the regulation that enforces that particular part of a long before they do that they've got to go through their own set of hearings and studies and so forth so\nA while we are glad that they are moving in this direction is something we asked the F. A. and the ah to look into\nBack in two thousand fourteen uh we do not we're not we're not going to hold our breath on us because they're going to take their time they're going to study it\nThey may come out with one thing that says the effect that we don't see a problem with the existing standards\nArchitect designed toys as well as playgrounds and play equipment and the last section of the exhibition focuses on corporate approaches so things um that were embraced by corporations in the mid century that outlook to playful and ...\nHow people might think back in the Nineteen fifties and maybe the word conformity might popular had everybody's wearing the same suit you've got cookie cutter houses but clearly people who design world word try to do something different can you talk about that moment and and what the designers were doing\nYeah you've actually hit it on the head I mean one of the things that I like to talk about is the man and the gray flannel suit and that is exactly it right this kind of a margin is Nineteen fifties momentum and there were a lot of architects and designers who were really striving to get away from that and so this is what we've done in this exhibition as we've looked at\nA number of these architect and designer over forty of them who have tried to get away from this ... this society and moved towards something that was a little bit more ... playful a you know in order to get out get out solutions to encourage free play and there were a lot of kind of outcome\nAnd as I understand that if I read this right there are some artifacts from that era but there's also some modern things inspired by that is that right\n[noise] no actually everything in the exhibition is from the period so it's all Nineteen forties through the nineteenth through the late Nineteen sixties with\nThe exception of um we do have three play areas in which people are encouraged to walk in and uh actually play with things that were made yesterday which is why they are allowed to touch those things so I think maybe that's what you're referring to are these play areas\nAnd there's a philosophy here that I think you you are interested in Andy's designers word the idea that a good cool stuff\nWith it instead of coming in with is a very serious approach\nYeah totally so I think you know when people stop and think about what the what the furniture from the period looks like\nYou might think about something that is um you know made of new materials or new technologies something like um the aims of plywood for example that seems pretty ubiquitous now but in the period it really comes out of a lot of experimentation that they do and so in the exhibition we have\nA number of examples from the Ames is but one that I'll call your attention to\nIs a small child's chair so they made children's furniture and the late Nineteen forties and actually it was while they were experimenting with their full sized plywood chairs that they decided to try to make the small scale children's furniture\nAnd so it really gets back at the at our central thesis which is you know through experimentation or play\n'em it's possible for designers to come up with so many you know so many different kinds of pasta positive outcomes and through ... and you you really get at different um you know different objects\nYou mentioned the ... and as I understand that some of these other designers didn't just work on one kind of thing we weren't just I I Do chairs or I'd have a lot of more experimenting and a lot of different mediums and forms\nYet so we up what's interesting is if you come to the exhibition you'll actually be able to see that so uh the angels are the kind of quintessential example feels the work from them that includes films and furniture and also toys for\nChildren and I think this is important because it really should get really it really shows people that architecture and design is not just you know a a kind of\nIt's not just a singular discipline but\nIn fact once you start blurring the boundaries you can do super interesting interesting things and it's not just the ... says um there were a number of design or is that um that kind of that that worked across many different disciplines one great example is um someone like Ann tang who's best known as an architect\nBut the projects that we are highlighting in the exhibition is actually her first project before she began making buildings and that was a tank toy and it was interesting modular toy um that was essentially a kind of kid of parts and kids could make kids adults\nOr could make anything from like a push cart to a table to you know whatever it is that your imagination allowed you to do and what's important about this is that\nEven in the period she ... she uh she said that it was this project that allowed her to do something playful and that allowed her to develop her ideas so play for the for the idea of play is really important because it gets architects and designers\nThinking about other projects\nThat are going to Monica Lewinsky uh she's with the Milwaukee art museum curator of a new exhibit they're serious played design in mid century America or just open up running for another bunch of months months there\nAt Monaco use is just kind of a novelty died and in the history of design or do things these designers you're featuring a Jew did back in the Nineteen fifties still echo today\nYeah I think I think so I mean I think we're seeing you know ... one of the things that people ask me about it so you know this seems like it's super popular now and there must be a reason and I think I'm actually I I think in terms of its ... it has been popular for a little while\nUm but I think in terms of its ideas right this idea that a free play or experimentation is really central to the work of architects and designers I mean if you look at something like Silicon Valley for example I mean they are really\nI'm a kind of driving this message home um and so I think certainly the the topic does um ... you know is is really a\nToday so I think I think we're seeing some some of these trends continue\nFor I've talked to a lot of guts to say the one of the key uh skills against one of the key competencies of an employee's creativity and worries that maybe we're we're focusing too much on\nYou know rigid facts math education and stuff like that and not nurturing the creativity and not worry you have as you as you look at the designs here\nI think actually that's exactly what these architects and designers we're getting at um you know just to give another example\nFrom the exhibition another architects that we feature his name is Arthur Corolla and he practiced in Chicago but he actually also had a lot of connections to Wisconsin one of the projects that we look at is his magnet masters which was a toy that he made for a museum in Minneapolis in the Nineteen forties and you think okay well this is just a silly thing right at\nThe bunch of shape colors and he's employing magnets and and asking children and adults to make things out of these I'm Out of these shapes and magnets\nBut actually he was thinking about magnetism at as not just something that was a a playful game but he was thinking about magnets for\nFuture buildings and he was trying to kind of get he was actually envisioning a future in which buildings could be held together\nBy a powerful magnetic core and it's only when you allow yourself to stop and dream and think about these things that you know the future as is possible I mean um and we can even think about something like you know Tesla or a you know going you know uh when when we when we talk about uh you know regular civilians going to the moon right I mean this kind\nOf thing wouldn't be possible fifty years ago if it weren't for um you know a designers vision\nWhat are you hoping to be the the non professional designers who visit the uh the exhibit what are you hoping they're inspired to do when they leave\n'em well I Hope that they come through the a bunch of really beautiful things that inspire them you know in their own lives I Hope that they take some time to actually explore the play areas and again let their mind go free and\nAnd maybe you know spin a top maybe haven't spent a top since you were seven but uh you know just to kind of enjoy the\nProcess of doing that and and I hope that actually gives you some pause and it causes you to think that oh maybe I should\nBlock out Fifteen minutes a day to not read something or not look at email or not look at my screen\nAnd actually just let my mind go I think that would be the greatest thing\nAre there are a couple artifacts in the exhibit that you'd want us to maybe pause by for a few extra minutes and really uh really taken and be inspired by\nOh my gosh there are things\nI don't want to tell you how many objects on the show because I don't want to scare you but um that you know I honestly I Believe that this the show in which there is a little bit of something for everyone and as I've gone through and I've watched people\nYou know pause at for example there's a beautiful installation of of mid century clocks um there are ten\nClocks that were uh most of them designed by Irving Harper for George Nelson one of them ... for the rest of this for for George Nelson a produced by Howard Miller clock company and these are just super fun super ... and the way that they're installed um you know causes people to kind of stop take a photograph\nYou know maybe maybe say like oh I remember seeing this in grandma's house um I think that there are a lot of really beautiful moments like that throughout the exhibition\nNow do you think maybe some you'll see these and we'll see a new a clock or abuse the furniture or what have you ah in terms of juniors inspired by what they saw their\nUm fingers crossed me and I would love for there to be some young designers I'm In you know in Milwaukee that are going through and and that that they're inspired by something that they see that would be really wonderful\nThanks so much Rob Monica Lewinsky as the dumber curator of twentieth and twenty first century design at the Milwaukee art museum shelled curated oversee this new exhibit we've been talking about serious played design in mid century America organize at the Denver art museum exhibits open now through January six\nBy the way there is a gallery talk with Monica tomorrow at one thirty PM at the museum check Mam dot org for more dates coming up learned about\nThere's racial segregation as you were mentioning an economic segregation or as as well can you talk about that\nWell I'm part of the issue is that a few of 'em have a low income group just pushed in one place there aren't any jobs around\nA half of the African American men in Milwaukee of some sort of a criminal record that makes it much harder to get a job any kind of job the good jobs in the prefer you need to get out there\nIf you have children you need childcare to to someone to take care of your kids so this makes it and not to mention of violence and the trauma that serve us makes it very difficult to lead a normal life and all economic licence most people would like to move if they could afford to\nSo my student Mitt Desmond wrote a famous book called evicted and man said you know in central city of Milwaukee people are paying forty and fifty percent of their incomes for rent\nBut of those kinds of some policy forum just as a lovely report it's not because rents are higher comes in vale if because incomes O'Donnell\nSo I'll give you one number this is a great guess and I\nSuppose I ask you the phone with it\nFamilies with children were living with incomes above twice the poverty line meaning about forty or fifty thousand dollars\nThe answer is one in eight only so if you pick a black kid out as a seven eighths chance are due to poor and therefore they're not doing well in school they're stuck in the central city schools they don't have alternatives the families can't move out\nTo avoid the violence and to improve the schools and things for their kids so that that's a problem if we're going to solve poverty and the state of Wisconsin we have to pay attention to Milwaukee\nTalking attempts meeting for me to be Madison looking at a new report on poverty rates in Milwaukee County in particular ten I'm hearing a whole bunch I kind of chicken or egg type questions there aren't jobs\nBut a job creators are going to want to move in this area if they don't feel like it's safe if there's not a opportunity to sell things to people I that's just one of the where\nDo you start type ... well you need to get people to the jobs and their jobs on the periphery or even the jobs are in the infrastructure or building up for Fox got it everything those jobs do not require high levels of education those are the sorts of jobs that if you're really desperate and needed someone for a job in employer could take someone\nOr formerly incarcerated person give them a chance working in a construction crew\nAnd in fact uh I don't see why that doesn't happen but uh\nYou know this has been terrible 'cause the blame game has been going on in Milwaukee for a long long time or the Democrats are better than the Republican some errors been sitting on this for for as long as he's been there and before that\nAnd somebody needs to get off the diamond make some changes there has to be some policy employers if they're hungry for people and they want to give people a second chance the way they are doing here in Madison\nYou need to go off or jobs to people give them a chance to they could subsidize them give them a shoe dollars off an hour for training purposes and gives them a bonus if they're still working in six months or something that would be one nice way of injecting some money into\nInto downtown of course you'd have to get them out to the jobs\nBut employer over there's there's ways of getting people to the jobs if if employers are hungry as some people think there\nIs there a need for subsidies for transportation like that as you say to get from said central sure doesn't\nLook in this town and you see all those red fence driving around those are all those state fans I when I was in the party Institute at six people here from New Britain Janesville boy to get an advantage we have to go back why can't there'll be a van somewhere in downtown Milwaukee the picks guys up at six thirty seven in the morning\nTakes them out to the job and brings them back after this a low cost if that's what an employer wants and if they need that labor\nAnd I mean this is all mixed up in the race to and racial politics we know you can find white formerly incarcerated men on the front page of the New York times walking out of prison into a job in stone trailer\nBut I Can't get any data from the state on how well we're doing with African American that on that same including keeping them from going back to prison and getting them jobs\nIs there's not a priority because of this is a primarily black area we're talking\nIt could be I mean a lot of people haven't reaction a black man that they're scary they've been in prison which a lot of them have some\nWho are violent shouldn't be it should be in prison they shouldn't be put young first time offenders if we can divert them something other than prison\nIf you could start get them involved in jobs if you give them an opportunity and the same thing now next fall the single parents they're going to say it for so low income you're still receiving our future program you have to go work thirty hours a week\nWell where's the childcare where's the transportation who's going to give them a chance is there a transition job you can go through so\nEr here who runs the for the local food cooperatives underground watcher\nHe and his colleagues set up a bakery sunshine bakery which gives people a chance to learn how to be bakers than in places them in jobs in the restaurant industry and the bakery industry in this town we need more and more things like that we we we really need to try and the same obviously for mothers with kids who\nWho also need to help directly themselves\nThe way you a measure poverty is a little different than the way the feds do you include the impact of public assistance programs in that and you just mentioned that possibility of a work requirements for public assistance are there ways we can do public assistance to\nBetter or that will create better incentives in say that's at thirty to forty percent a poverty rate sure\nFor first of all we can have a higher minimum wage that's Fifteen dollars but not seven and a quarter we could go to nine or ten dollars which is what we've done it gives you an incentive to go out to work because she'll get more\nOkay but we haven't stopped getting minimum wage if I don't want to start a business in central Milwaukee paying minimum wage why do I want to start with paying higher and and it\nWas like no no I don't want you to start a business or I Want to get the people out to the business is OK I'm not\nI mean there are ways of trying to stimulate business is business in Milwaukee but business in those areas Milwaukee's expensive I've been to those areas they have to rent they have rather guards at the ... in the back door and people are afraid to go there at night and things like that [noise]\nUm so if we can't fix that area directly the trick is to give people enough economic wherever fall as they can move out of there so expanded low income housing would help too but uh that's expensive more generally\nAll right how about a once people start getting money is there a way we can make the community something that they don't want to move out of once they can afford\nTo that would be wonderful that takes leadership within the community it takes policing the streets would take reducing continue to\nReduce crime um it's just very difficult reducing unplanned pregnancies will be good so that I'm young women and men who did not want to have a baby didn't have an accent and they have a baby\nWhich if you don't have your education or a job or that creates you know really steep row to hoe feeds you know if you don't if you haven't finished your education out of a job you don't have a partner and you don't have a plan [noise]\nIt's hard to raise that kid in the non poverty situation and then it hurts the employment situation and the mother and father and the father may end up in jail\nSince it's you know\nOne of the things that we do know that work so it's a lot of people who are scared are afraid to move out\nTo move out of the city into in a different area and if we could do more of that that would help and one way to do it as if people could earn some money and get their earned income tax credit when they get at once among the first and last month's rent that could allow you to move okay if we had a child allowance at our country like other\nIf we took three child tax credit of two thousand dollars a year which I get and most of their parents do\nAnd made it paid among the animated refundable that'd be a hundred and Seventy bucks a month check that per kid that every mother would get and they could use that to to help\nEnhance education their children maybe find a private school a Catholic school some other school but also to them to you know not worry about whether you have to choose between the ... the rent and so forth every month\nTo

that people have been looking for\nA little bit about it it's definitely an update and people on all sides of the fact that I say you know we need it they update now\nThat sense the modernization is good but there's also some changes I mean there's the Trump Administration and all three countries do deserve recognition for up making some tough compromises in different areas and making some changes to the agreement that I think we'll ...\nWe'll dig into some of the changes in general right now I Want to key in on one here in Wisconsin and give a listen to President Trump he specifically mentioned Wisconsin dairy farmers when he announced this today and the lack of access some of had the Canadian dairy markets there's a lesson\nWe've opened it up to our farmers so the folks up in Wisconsin I tell you what I Want to Wisconsin I went to Iowa Joni knows better than anybody right as Scott Walker who I think is a fantastic governor talks about it all the time\nOur farmers were not treated properly by Canada now they're going to be treated with respect\nA diving into the details make and there was one class in particular of dairy products that Canada had had raised tariffs on a lot of tension here in Wisconsin that is one of them was one of the sticking point and it sounds like that's something that got ironed out and disagreement\nAbsolutely I think you're referring to class that ... across southern ... think that that meant so candidate to drop the system which is a big win for us dairy farmers and the other dairy update is that um in general that Canadian dairy market is open is going to be open by about three\nYou can join in and eight hundred six four to one two three four Marcia Bryant is a professor\nAll are at the University of Florida She's taught classes on domestic life the Nineteen fifties and see a co teaches a class on the impact of materials on society she wrote an article for the conversation called from swag swag the story of Earl Tupper is fantastic plastics Marsha thanks a lot for joining us\nYou're quite welcome and thanks for having me well your piece a solved one question I had were Tupperware got its name it was made by a guy named top her\nIt was indeed and a light Kramer says something people just don't want to let go of so what made the Tupperware so special [noise]\nWell I think that's a good question um I think a couple of things at first I think it's really cool if you look at it it's pretty it has my shapes um and it actually ended up in the museum first so people like to look at it\nAnd then people like to use it and uh it's it's functional it fits in your refrigerator your catch on me and my family never sold that but I'm kind of addicted to having now so it's pretty and you can do things with that\nNow this Earl Tupper he's working for dupont and they're trying to figure out our we've got all this plastic waste and slag uh and and so what does he do how does he tried to figure out what to do with it\nWell the um couple of things I think up first of all he he was a self educated person so I think part of why he could figure out what he might want to do it that if he read a lot she read a lot of literature he went to trade fair's he talked a lot to women he asked women in kitchens\nHow could your life be easier said when he started working um at the dupont affiliate they they would let sample makers take stuff home and so she wanted to change the look of it and he wanted to put it in the kitchen\nSo um I thought that was a cool thing to ... it's kind of let people had their way with innovation\nEnded I read this right he actually was heating it up on his stove to mold that\nThey they let you take stuff from WorldCom so yeah he did he um he had his son help and that sort of the Cayman men's kitchen project you might say and um yeah he decided he would take the pots and play with an himself\nI don't know if history recorded this but I once accidentally melted a Tupperware lid his kitchen must have smells horrible right\nNow [laughter] and I and actually cringing just thinking of that is that good\nSo so he ends up with these projects with these ... that stay on but you're right that the American housekeepers are not necessarily ready to put their faith in plastic ... how did how did you try to overcome\n[noise] um well first of all he had to make it look better uh it had to not look cheap um and I think part of the good design you know why it started off in a museum helped a lot\nBut also uh people were using class jars to store things I don't know as I I make bread I use a Mason jar it's a different sense of LEDs were out and so she had to have something that didn't crunch shop\nOr something that I don't know like if you made dressing if you wanted to put the nigger in it ah the the plastic wouldn't start to break down\nA and so yeah you figure it out if it can be functional it looked good and you could make the LEDs tight then you could say you know what it cost a little more but it saves you money so plastic was no longer cheap\nTalking to Marcia Brian professor at the University of Florida about the history of Tupperware and how it went from a home a project melting plastic on the stove to\nA private thing using everybody's kitchens just about a big part of the success story was a woman by the name of brownie wise which was a heck of a name can you tell us about her and her part in the Tupperware story\nShe has a huge part in the story um I mean I think it would probably be ...\nA great product but you can't sell it so um she had a lot of hardships up into Troy eight um she had a fund was a lot of health problems her husband had left her and so she was a door to door sales woman a\nAnd she saw some of the Polly tea or used to be called poly T products and she could see that first of all this is really different and secondly if you can put it in a woman's hands she'll probably by it so she uh\nYes you sort of transformed gender roles for a lot of women in the fifties\nAnd at the the state of the arguments of the glass jars as an option but also people we're storing food by rubbing tinfoil around it or looming in ... uh which is one way to do it or I didn't notice putting my shower caps to food caps too\nIf you lose your masons our lives or something you could put a shower cap of her jar but you know not not such a good thing and they don't want your toddler to get a hold of that through through\nAnd when you when people say Tupperware people thing of Tupperware parties can you talk about how that became such a big way of spreading this new product\n[noise] yeah I um I don't know if you guys says uh looked at the PBS Tupperware film a but but yeah I was just repealing that because I teach about the fifties but yeah so what so what happened was brownie figure it out you need direct sales and at the time when a different social classes um there were\nThere was a pressure that you know the man had to be the breadwinner you couldn't make the husbands feel he didn't have what my mother called provider you know father as a provider\nAnd so through a Tupperware party you know you could be found your house wipe your hostess and that was a a role when then we're supposed to have\n'em but you could also be a businesswoman and so the party was a way to get lonely Lehman stock with childcare all day which can be delightful I Will say\nA bit but it kind of gave women on cars were pretty expensive most families can have two and so they could have socialization that can make a little extra money uh and uh\nThey got to uh you know make their kitchens more functional and and make friends so yeah it became a socially acceptable way from\nA mostly white women but also African American women women in cities rural areas and emergent suburbia so it it kind of created this new way a woman could be and be socially acceptable\nThere you're taught a class called a desperate domesticity the American Nineteen fifties how does a Tupperware itself it into a I guess this new definition of what it was to be a woman homemaker at home that evolved in the post war years\nOh lots of life I have to give a shout out please to Desperate Housewives which is a forest fire named the course desperate enough to city um\nBut uh yeah if you think about my favorite character on that show prevent a camp or how she comes and she hopes those baskets right with the kingdom napkins so so you know I'm I think in this desperate to necessity Tupperware\nCreated a um [noise] and it's a new static for the catch and prayed and and so it kind of helped when then\nI come up with something to do and as something to show off and you could make your cabinet flipped like an art gallery and that ... I Wish my cabinets motives nice as heroes of Tupperware and these ads\nRight you mentioned to the design and the look of Tupperware was maybe as big a part of its success as the function of it\nYeah and end up going back to that you know I Do kitchen experiment I'm not sure if memory Tupper let Earl use the pots after it out but um yeah so so what he was able to figure out if you can make it translucent you can make it a um opaque and he wanted to make a different colors\nSo I think um if you've seen like I'm not holding a lovely violets a Tupperware\nIt's Tupperware around me that people get me because they know I teach Tupperware and they actually get it from the state itself I don't know what I'll do it without us Tupperware uh but yeah I mean some type of shiny translucent a bright colors pastel colors I think I think it's\nDon't know that people talk about the city's being a housewife us a directory I don't know that that's true and then in the city's a lot more complicated than people like to assume\nUh that that I feel like the kitchen certainly became more colorful uh and and the shapes were were pretty they read and um I think that that\nIs up or one of those products like a Kleenex or Xerox copy machines where maybe they were a victim of their own success their brand name became the universe for the type of product I\nThink that's really a good question I think yes and no okay so if you could probably tell listeners I'm southern uh and so and the southeast United States us we don't say sneakers would say you know tennis shoes even if it's not for tennis we say Kleenex even at that pops right coke can mean I'm a non Coca Cola product\nBut I don't think that you know you just getting me to think about that I I don't hear people call it my plastic where I've seen people take offense if someone says\nI don't want to disparage on other brand so someone says hey I got this plastic products that you know the store and they call it temple where anyone that have temporal will say oh no that's not aware so\nYeah I mean I guess that's a pretty distinctive marketing to solve it doesn't it doesn't stretch its meaning like say the word clean acts you know any of it when I Lived in Illinois that word was tissue\nBut yeah even down south Tupperware is Tupperware and no other plastic Tupperware\nHow to do that that's that's pretty cool and we'll leave it there are Marsha thanks a lot for joining us today I don't really appreciate it you're quite welcome and thanks for having me\nFor now while we figure out who we are not I'm not helping write it off the wall WNPR figures out what's going\nOn yeah that's that's exactly right and and so at least for the next couple of weeks and it gives us a chance to kind of look at where we are and consider next steps alright\nUh and before we get to calls an election year Mike a lot of a lot of stuff going on here at Wisconsin Public radio and our friends are on the other side of the building or Wisconsin Public television can you talk about some of the things we have to look forward to when it comes to election preview\nSure in addition to the night of and the next morning we'll have lots of coverage then including live coverage on election night and coming up or a couple of specials or the Senate candidate special\nUh will be coming up on October twelfth at seven PM and that'll be on the ideas network and W.

Carol Hi\nI was surprised to last week there which I can hear your great with Larry ... all\nWe had people for for a while you get a week or so who can say well let's see [noise]\nI care Oh thanks for the call and we did do some changes on the overall ideas networks schedule and I so it's possible in some cases when that happens that it's just at a different time\nAnd just sitting here now I don't recollect exactly what happened there but one of the many kind of to me interesting details but sometimes challenging for listeners details of WPRI as we are sort of a collection of stations and our affiliates in notion WG TDY\nOr they have a a different kind of a schedule\nI and if on the other hand you're listening to W. ha de out of ... Milwaukee then people's pharmacy is still on but it's on earlier I think than it was and we'll look that up and and they try and give you the exact time before the end of the half hour here but that's the basic idea and you're talking to the right people it's good to know that you're concerned about that and\nI Will try to get that information to you and if you encountered\nQuestions like that about the programming you can call her audience services line check me on this my eight hundred seven four seven seven for for for you got I should have this memorized by now or listener at W.

Smith who's in LA based journalist uh Joan Walsh and a marine hosts it from NPR's Latino USA Brian Lehrer from WNYC and more and they're all kind of rotating host\nAnd ah America on the line is kind of a pun right because\nThe future is on the line in that metaphorical sense and it's a call and talk show or and so we encourage you to put the radio back on if you've turned it off after central time or just stick around\nFor America on the line and that's again on the ideas network live Monday through Thursday seven to eight PM\nOr as you say currently replacing as it happens that to happen and comes back after the elections\nBy the way up people's pharmacy if you're looking on that for its new spot seven AM on Saturday mornings though WG TD and can also as we heard might be a different story because they are and they normally WG TV carries the news in classical network schedules so that's why I'm suggesting looking at W. H. A.\nD. uh and it's interesting ah when we moved it to seven o'clock some people were quite upset with us and and I remember one email saying no one is awake then uh but that's actually the time when it's on its home station at W.
