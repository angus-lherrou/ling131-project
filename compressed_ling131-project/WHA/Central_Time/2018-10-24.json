I was ten I took care of a seven year old and a woman and a half year old I was responsible\nBarbara I'm going to jump in thank you for calling and sharing your story a junior Barbara part of a very wide range of reaction I make across the political spectrum to a images of this large group of migrants\nThat's right I've been talking to voters in some key a congressional districts ah this past week answering both that sentiment that\nThese are just people coming to find a better life or that they're going to do the kinds of jobs that many Americans don't want to do that people have trouble filling um and that they don't mean any harm\nEconomically or otherwise to Americans\nBut I also hear the opposite which is that ah the United states ceases to be able to support more people and that there aren't enough jobs and that says Americans who don't want them to just go do them in stock complaining about not having\nA job so at this still a lot of different opinions across the political spectrum\nBarbara thanks for the call Steven Dan Marino Steve Hi\nFi I always wanted to do with her and the ... probably the largest revert to further north led to some Republican Party offer it was just me or does it mean somewhat stretching the bounds of believability that search that\nWas huge ... coming north now I'm going to arrive right around election\nYou thanks for the call ginger I I've seen people say that I see people from the other side so this is a democratic funded a George Soros wanted to bring his name up again there are a lot of conspiracy theories and the and a lot of misleading information out there about the\nSouth right I think I saw it put backed by someone on Twitter and I wish I could remember here to give them credit\nI'm that as these parties can organize their own voters and Pennsylvania what makes you think they've gone\nAnd organized and voters are in Honduras to travel thousands of miles in order to influence the election um it is a bit of a conspiracy theory I think to to believe that they are being organized by\nPolitical operatives on either side um although it is\nElection uh they're all kinds of events in the world that affect the election we all remember a Bola and twenty fourteen that was not a political conspiracy to influence the outcome of the election but it surely did influence that election at the time\nThanks for the call or let's move on to another election related issues ginger you recently reported that this year's congressional campaign seasons on pace to break some fundraising records what are we seeing we're seeing\nLiterally billions of dollars\nAre being poured into this election cycle a at a rate which is going to set new records at the end of this third quarters at the end of the month of September house candidates of both political parties had raised one point two billion dollars\nBeating the record but they held\nI'm from twenty ten at the same point in that election cycle\nOf a billion dollars a this is an unprecedented amount\nOf money we saw election fundraising really stabilized and be plateaued for the last\nEight years but enthusiasm on the left and a lot of candidates running particularly in the primary for democratic nomination has really infused a ton of cash into this election cycle\nOr their particular races you're looking at ... ... breathtaking amounts of money being pumped him\nOne of them would be the Texas Senate race where a beta or work a current member of Congress has really just raised a impressive sums of money and much more that his Republican opponent Ted Cruz we see in a house race is a Amy McGrath\nIs running in Kentucky as a Democrat who raised three point eight million dollars I'm In a single quarter a there are previously house races that would not have cost a million dollars for three point eight million dollars in a single quarter is just\nA an earth shattering number\nAre going to junior Gibson from writers looking at some of the top stories in national political news plus some sad news ginger a former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced this week she's something away from public life are she's revealed a diagnosis of dementia or can you remind us of the impact she had a on the court in combination\nSaturday O'Connor was the first woman nominated to the Supreme Court um and really sort of broke a glass ceiling that had been there for women she's been followed\nBy a number of other women were bitter Ginsburg um and then subsequently a Hagen and um other women who have come on to the court a but really it was sort of the first uh to take that role she left the court or we know that a\nJustices are appointed for life and they can stay there until they die a she opted not to she had played a small public oil since leaving the court and has a has been\nA speaking and some places but now she will uh were remove ourselves from that and it's sort of my art as the other woman at me and left me there for a moment\nOf and then a germ finally usually when we talk to you are in a Washington DC right now you're actually human Wisconsin a and you're in town for a town hall event focusing on trade and tariffs what's going on\nThat's great as a group that is sponsored by business will be holding a town off and in Milwaukee suburb tomorrow or that group of culture for the heartland they're going to be talking about how\nThe president's first particularly on steel and aluminum and those on imported goods from China are affecting the local economy we're going to hear from the restaurant association from wheat\nHere in the Milwaukee area as well as senator Johnson uh who will be talking about the impact us so I have traveled to your great state uh I Would take all dinner recommendations from Milwaukee to my Twitter account gender gets and um\nAnd and will be given the opportunity to talk about that what they're seeing in in the trade 'em and that their their prices that their local stores when they're shopping\nAnd you reported not too long ago that business groups are just talking about these tariffs they're spending on 'em there's some political advertising going on from from some industry groups\n... this group is putting money in addition to these events it's not a coincidence that they're holding this event the day after President Trump is here or there specifically targeting play says that he's going on and it's critical money and that they're saying\nThat you should or shouldn't vote for any party a but they're trying to get voters to tell their elected officials that this is something that they're concerned about and that they want them to be working to get rid of these terrorists\nAnd we don't always see major business groups spending against Republicans in big watched it again this is not direct campaign funding but it is on an issue where they are critical of the sitting Republican presidents\nThat normally when groups like that uh are are engaged in active\nAll them against Democratic president you don't normally see multimillion dollar campaign targeted at Republican presidents but this is the position that President Trump has really run crop that\n... business groups and business organizations and for that reason they are taking the fight they stay\nAt that these terrorists could really impact does is such that it would undo all of the economic gains that had been made in this administration um and they're they're concerned about the last the impact they could have\nAnd to draw I Want to take a few moments to commiserate you are in Houston Astros fan yes I Am and hearing ruined country with us today so we're in the same boat\nWe're all in morning this week it could have been what could have been a and it's not all have to just dream of\nI guess we could have had a heated argument I said if things had gone differently and just lets you know ginger our producer Chris tweeted about wanting restaurant recommendations at Central time WPRI so hopefully we can get some good news for you in Milwaukee thanks ginger as always thank you I appreciate\nIt a always glad to join yeah\nDid you get them as a political correspondent for Reuters she joined us today for our weekly look at the latest news in national politics\nYes and the previous crop let's go to court and the show and and basically as in the same situation comedy is right it was the most part could have been on a a buzz saw but then there was an earlier form of his tournaments the easiest fungus that were just talking about a machete astray and it's been around since the late Eighteen hundreds and that did get a lot of America\nAnd essentially that you did away with all of those shows and and actually you know if you talk to anyone that's actually even as a touchdown and they said it was nice that are kind of sweet or\nUm there'll be a kind of clear and ... and ... century this fungus complete did away with and we have to switch to have been on a ... does not see resistance which is why we ended up with the ... gone now\nSo is there a plan see if we lose the Cavendish this fungus that can meet the same needs cheap durable easy to transport ripe ones at the right speed is there is something that we can just say okay well too bad about the Cavendish we'll try this other banana\nThere's no a backup but on a I mean he was saying the the kind of the entire industry is more or less\nYou know central is one but I don't know why you know for me in the u._k. it's cheaper to buy a bunch but on it and it's by apples that might be grown in Spain of UK and that's because this whole thing is uh you know try to cater and it's very very reliable fruit and so what about those uh different types of but honestly the thousand different practice is\nKnown a really stepped up uh in the industry tracked she'd be you know usually the kind of scale that we you know easy competition a minute\nWe're talking about the future of the banana threatened by a fungus Matt Reynolds is with us from wired u._k. so a lot of your reporting on this map looks at efforts to a tweak the genes of the Cavendish banana so what is out there and he's efforts\nYeah so it's actually ... the scientists I spoke to trying to do is to try and keep all those states that the company should we likes the fact is with us she takes ... brown\nI'm the United states and tasty and it grows really easily keep all those elements ... century just changed is one thing I'm not one thing if it's resistance to a plug them into the so they're trying to see if they can I have a\n... a gene from a number on it it's not should resist and or otherwise try and tweak it he NA so they can make it completely resistance so you're saying she you've got the Cavendish but you just kind of given that tiny little leg off and you know DNA test and says you know gains resistance\nThere are still experiments going on does anything look promising\nYeah there were a few says it depends what somebody most ahead with this is talk with James ... he's a researcher in I'm In queens and then uh uh Australia and he's basically already done so he's crazy it's been on is that um are resistant to a pet them and see if anybody can say that I'm expose used on us to put them in the end\nHe's doing it using a technique that involves I'm taking a gene from a different topic but not enough and putting into the Cavendish and that means that at least in the u._k. and use it for them to the front of genetic a champion you modified openness and Bruce it means that now has to be labeled or um is restricted we've kind of growing and stuff so we've kind of go this solution\nUm but because of the kind of regulations around to it being are held back if you'd like\nThere are other efforts you write that don't take a other types of bananas or other types of organisms genes and put them into the Cavendish banana they just use this as CRISPR technology which is all over the place now and just make a splice within the Cavendish banana gene what's going on in that\nYeah that's right so that the James get again was one of the people to do that shit realizing that his government on your to put on if you like it was not going to ... you can see them as he was like what kind of go to Chris and people can do that and essentially you know like you said about what you're really doing is just going into the the genomic self making quite a precise ...\nTo try and say what if we take this gene deactivate Dave does that help us um you know increase the resistance than beef that syndication is all that um yeah that we seem to be able to do it um\nSay the the results from jail James's study seem pretty positive and there's also a company a coup tropic biosciences base in the u._k. and no rich is doing a very similar thing and that saying that you could do this to make a Nazi decaffeinated coffee or you could make a you know longer lasting fruit so um\nChristmas really being kind of falls into kind of agricultural well there's you know the answer to a lot of questions\nFor GMO regulators and consumers who are wary of them for for various reasons or does this count as genetically modified if they haven't imported genes from other species or strains there just a make a little beliefs in ... in this one species DNA code\nWell that depends who you off so in the ... in the uh in Europe for the European Union very recently a couple of months ago a decided that yes they are just the same with GMOs so if you ah you know and it's something using CRISPR than actually that's not quite not from that should be regulated in the same way and applied you have even a very stringent I'm\n... I'm In the states that she had the kind of regulation places the environment is is it a little more um a lot more lenient and say you have kind of a Christa Christa edited mangoes or ... mushrooms\nThat ... century I think the um the USDA obey the FDA said that actually Krista because it's pretty not really making quite whether or not not that different you walk out in nature anyway\nSo uh we're not going to regulate it quite Seventy so yeah it it kind of depends where you um\nSo if I'm a growers say in South America Central America if I take this CRISPR technology I might save my plantation I might be able to solve the U.S might not be able to solve the EU potentially there's all this concern out\nYeah exactly and that's the thing and I think that you find this from that but on the computer so you know I spoke to all the major but on the news\nYou know for the peace and really that pretty reckless him to say that they're doing it in the things that I'm\nInvolved jihad single stuff like that because it can sound like you're saying I Would do things with a ... or something that is on and I got the phrase Franken foods and stuff like that get offended about\nBut I think the real thing is is that this is the question of whether you watch you won't have been on it to five a tool and maybe we're not quite at that point right because that divvied isn't in Latin America it's not really affecting them really badly\nWhen actually is a duo diamond maybe they'll change and have to think well that's all we can do it you know we're not there yet but I think that maybe not too far away\nNow if there's a gene technology doesn't take route I guess if you will if this fungus can't be stopped what happens to our consumers cheap banana effects well\nIs and the way we have it on a minute just not very sustainable admitted it takes a huge amount of pesticides or have been on it and uh it's pretty damaging to the environment and then there's all kinds of problems in terms of health and and things like that I mean maybe it'll go back to you what you kind of the impatience Southeast Asia where you actually have a big range of bananas and\nEssentially to the ... the different crops actually it it helps gotta get get\nTwelve different like on a I mean you get one disease you might have a twelve dollars wiped out you're not going to have the entire field wiped out and so it's not really much more of a bust ... yeah the the flip side of that it's more expensive than say maybe to talk to go out to have more interesting to eat or maybe you know the industry will get back together\nMatt thanks a lot for joining us today thank you\nThat rentals or the tech reporter at wired u._k. we talked with them about why the most common variety of banana maybe on a path to extinction and how scientists are trying to save him\nComing up swapping free pizza for free speech what we'll find out about an annual First Amendment event in ... stay with us here on central time [noise]\nSometimes on ask me you know there are contestants are wrong\nOther times they're so wrong there right of course\nThose three words illustrated as funny as\nDoing meal here Eisenberg on NPR's our of cousins were games and trivia\nSaturday morning at ten on the ideas network [noise]\nSupport for WPRI comes from boardman Clarke Wisconsin law firm dedicated to the art of listening and the power of informed discourse serving businesses individuals and local governments throughout the state boardman Clark dot\nCom support also comes from visiting ... with an assortment of entertainment options like Shakespeare bike trails and bluegrass a trip planner and events calendar is available from explore Minnesota tourism and visit ... dot com\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Clydesdale shows coming in Wisconsin it'll be a Madison's a lion energy center October twenty fifth through twenty eight central time executive producer judo Sears Wausau talked to cap the bane recently executive director of the ideal breeders of the usa\nKathy what is the history of the Clydesdale breed\nThe history of the ... failed breed that Clydesdale breed as I have a draft horse it's I'm part of that that draft horse world um they had um evolved in Scotland actually and during the nineteenth century and they were a powerful\nAnd and perfect build for the scat Scottish farmland and the coal fields in Atlantic chair and for all kinds of heavy hauling and um they branched out into other countries Australia New Zealand Canada and the United states\nAnd what is the history been here in the U.S\n[noise] the clay failed breeders of the United states um they have been they were incorporated in Eighteen Seventy nine and had been working on promoting the Clydesdale breathe through pure bred registry publications shows you know public promotion\nUm and so the ... breeders has been working a long time to um help the Clydesdale horse evolve\nSo you said in Scotland they were really well suited for an agricultural work their own word they used for that also in North America\nYes they were they were and then as everything evolves you know we got the tractors and we got equipment that would take over that were some people still use them as a workhorse\nUm but they've become more of a you know a pure bred that is um to breed to show and to 'em for enjoyment more than actual work because of all the tractors and industry\nWell and I have to say ever since I knew that I was going to be talking with you about this I had kind of a nonstop soundtrack in my head of that Budweiser commercials and the beautiful footage of you know these these huge but suck so elegant horses you know prancing in front of the the Budweiser\nBeer wagon word they used a here in Wisconsin certainly we have a huge beer history were they associated with the beer industry\nAbsolutely Anheuser Busch has really done or are breed proud um they have promoted the Clydesdale horse and its majestic qualities to AT T um they have become national icons of the ... you know the Budweiser Clyde steals are respected and\nUm by everyone so they have really pushed the breed out there and they have promoted the beauty of the breed you know the um personality and agility of the breed they've really helped with public public awareness and made the ... breed one of the most favorite draft horses\nWill tell us about the breed the horse in some cells what kind of temperament for instance do they have\nWell the ... failed breed is known as the gentle giants\nUm that kind of a a like a slang word that way but it is true um these big horses are very gentle they're very smart and very trainable they're very eager to please um and they are people force and I mean not only being beautiful there just a pleasure to be around\nThere are so big are they able to be written\nYes writing his really evolved in the last decade and at our world quite feel show we have really gone into that for ... the breed that's kind of what we're promoting in our industry now because we all see I'm In ... you know pulling the big Budweiser wagon\nWe see ... in the past year and there's nothing more beautiful than that but they also are very trainable in very they're good athletes so we have evolved in a\nWriting western English dressage will have a jumping class\nBarrel racing um there's nothing that a Clydesdale really can't do\nBecause yeah an animal that size it's a ... you might think that they would be less that Joe Biden and sounds like that's not the case how much bigger aren't they than an average I don't even know what an average horses but but\nThey are um the draft horses are all bigger breeds um there's different breeds within the draft horse industry but I'm a Clydesdale horse can get all the way up to Eighteen plus hands and they can weigh up to a time when they're all matured out so\nThat is over two thousand pounds had is that it mhm wow they'd we laugh we said you know that can they can wait as much as a Volkswagen Beatles car you know but so they're very very big which makes their\nAgility the same as the light horse but like the barrel racing won't go as fast because there's so much bigger but\nThe the agility and ability to do that kind of discipline is there\nWe're talking with Kathy ... executive director of the Clydesdale breeders of the United states and we're talking about the twenty Eighteen world Clydesdale show which is happening in Madison October twenty fifth she's twenty eight and one of the really um\nCharacteristic things about Clydesdale or those huge homes ... how did those developer is that common with draft horses\nThat big who have all the draft breeds have a big who\nThey are big animals and for the work that they do they have to have a big spoof to support their weight and to pull and so if you think about a draft horse\nThere who is going to be about as big as your dinner plate ... they have to have that underneath them to support their body and to do what they do they have to have that good big foot on them\nHow do you get involved with Clydesdale Kathy\n[laughter] my family we're a fourth generation family here in northern Illinois my parents' rented a farm years ago and the landlord happened to have quite so horses here\nWith us we have evolved from that um we get involved in that and um we tease if you've ever been bitten by a Clydesdale bug it's something that you don't ever get over once you you know get involved with the breed you just\nIt's a necessity in life kind of\nSo that's how we got involved and we're going on a fourth generation now here on our farm raising the Clydesdale horses\nI saw that six hundred Clydesdale from around the world will be at the world Clydesdale shows how do you transport a horse that big\nYes we had um actually six hundred and fifty quite feel horses\nAnd um we call it a world shows so that the horses usually come by semi truck or trucking trailer some people have so far journey they will go so far in a day and then they'll lay over at a what they call a horse hotel\nVersus can rest and get their nourishment they need and then back in the trailer so I'm to the United states and Canada they use semi trucks or you know the trailer just a horse trailer\nAnd um\nSometimes when you export from overseas we like to know that we're international partners on keeping this breed going so most of the time if you bring a horse from another country it's by air freight\nSo they literally are getting onto a plane\nYes yes they do um we have some horses from other countries here that had been purchased and acts and imported into the United states prior so they're already here we had a couple of horses one from South Africa that was supposed to join us but the protocol\nOn the blood work is so stringent that um that horse got hung up and quarantine but we have many many people from all over the world coming to this event\nAnd can't be as we wrap up if people come to the world Clydesdale show in Madison what\nSchedule is on our Web site for the world hike showed that term but they're going to the flavor editors to tally the horse you you'll have horses shown ... traffic it was the other rating that jumping barrel racing to ask\nYou a fee which is going to go up to a higher hit so like a well rounded shell it over and get wow it\nAnd I think the most important point about them is that they feel really fatigued by the political partisan bickering of this moment and really are eager for something new and something that's more a compromise oriented something that isn't as bitter acrimonious and something\nInteresting on the the edges here you've got progressive activists devoted conservatives on the opposite end but then you've got your digital conservatives in traditional liberals but they aren't really a mirror image of each other they kind of function differently those traditional conservatives do you find are in many ways more engaged they're not as frustrated at the traditional liberals what's going on\n[noise] the traditional liberals and conservatives have do have something in common and that that they are more or less of the same generation these tend to be of a baby boomer generation a little bit older\nAnd they also tend to think of themselves as Americans they have pride in Being American especially on the conservative side but where they differ is in their emotions towards the country today traditional conservatives this is Nineteen percent of the population these are people who are\nUm they are primarily supportive of Trump and so this isn't a moment where they feel only frustration at the United states\nThey also feel like their voices are being heard you feel as if the country is moving in a positive direction in many ways and so they're not as\nFrustrated and fatigue by this political moment as the traditional liberals are who feel very much that the country is headed in the wrong direction and I think if we had done this study for instance in twenty two thousand nine or two thousand and ten in the heyday of\nThe Tea Party and the early years of the Obama presidency we would have defined the exhaust majority group a little differently and we I think the traditional liberals would have been more and the positive side and the traditional conservatives would've made up part of this exhausted frustrated majority talking\nTo Steven Hawkins from the group more in common about a new report from the group he's the lead researcher it's called hidden tribes saying\nThe story of polarization and the United states there's a lot more going on and when you dig and Stephen ... a lot of dig into some of these groups more but I Want to ask the big picture question as you say a lot of these these people are in this exhausted majority\nWe do with this information what can we do a to engage them and maybe the polarized maybe get along a little better\n[laughter] I think the first thing we have to do is recognize that there's really a problem in our political discourse we asked a lot of questions about this in our in our study and one of the dynamics that was really\nStriking to us was that people both recognize that there is a problem of hate speech in our country and it needs to be addressed and that there's a problem of political correctness of of of policing speech and if people taking offense very easily\nAnd these dynamics are really difficult to navigate for most people and it's causing them to retreat from politics it means they don't want to post on line they don't want engage in the conversation at work or over the dinner table with her family Thanksgiving and that is\nA fundamental obstacle to us being able to work together because we're not having those conversations we're not seeing the best in each other and were free to draw these caricatures um these kind of cartoon versions of the other side to make them out to be worse than they are\nI think the second thing we need to do is recognize that there really are fundamentally different world views different cultures and stories that were telling on the left in the right\nOn the left there's a story that's about allowing the individual to prosper and flourish and have a lot of freedom that we need to be careful about authority because too much authority is suffocating and its oppressive and we need to be respectful and focus on freedom and equality that's a good story on the right there's a story that says let's be careful\nIndividuals' left to their own devices can be selfish they can make mistakes and they can uh they need good leadership the need strong families they need strong culture they need religion they need education to being out the best solved self discipline is very important\nFamily is very important and those are two stories that both have degrees of merit and need to be told at the same time and instead they're vilified the worst versions of these stories are used to characterize each other and we don't hear what each side is trying to bring to the table\nI Want to jump to this group or one in four people as you say the politically disengaged and I've heard over the years people from the left and the right saying\nThere's all these people out there we know they agree with us if we just to activate them we're going to win every election uh it's way more complicated than that what did you learn about this quarter of Americans who fall into this politically disengaged\nCategory well this is a group that is disproportionately young they're um the group that's most likely to have children under the age of Eighteen that they're still raising a this is a group that includes a lot of people who are lower income who have less education\nFor them politics and national story is a little bit of a luxury for their time they're more focused on raising their children making sure they get to\nFinished their degree I meant so they're not as engaged in politics they're focused on other things\nThere are also groups it's quite discouraged and they don't see 'em they see politics is both intimidating on the one hand because it's complex and it's that's you know it's a different world in some ways\nBut also as a place that is frustrating because they don't see a root for their engagement they don't see a payoff for their participation in politics\nUm is is also a group that um is a bit prone to conspiratorial thinking we ask them questions in our study the gauge\nPeople's propensity to believe in stories about a conspiracy is it a grand scale and and this was a group that uh gravitates to where's this as well so it's it's a low information group they don't um with regards to politics and they're not very active politically in and across the board so they're not\nThinking about politics and not watching on TV as much than a posting about it on social media and they're not voting very often either\nWe're talking about polarization and the United states was Steven hock in the lead author of a new study called hidden tribes he's with the group more in common\nIt Doug beyond the left or right to debate this study you did and found a lot of different groups of people in the United states seven of them to be precise you can join in at eight hundred six four to one two three four\nDo you feel like the extremes on both ends of the political spectrum get too much attention do you feel like\nYour views are left out like a a middle ground is left out sometimes do you identify with one

with a range between five hundred and fifty five hundred kilometers so about thirty four hundred miles max\nAnd it was created at a time where we had been deploying these missiles in Europe and and Russia is well creating a short warning nuclear attack threat for the entire continent and it was really raising tensions are as a possible nuclear war on the continent to such a level\nThat there was incredible public backlash and a real drive for Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev to solve this problem they met in Reykjavik Iceland in Nineteen eighty six\nAnd as a result of that summit they created the INS treaty which has been enforced ever since\n... the president right that Russia appears to be in violation of that treaty\nYeah absolutely Russia has been in violation of this treaty or\nThe Obama administration announced that violation back in twenty fourteen and we've been trying to get the Russians back into compliance ever since it's been a slow process the Russians have been\nSort of in a complete state of denial about the ... violation and uh the nature of the violation has made it hard to talk about in public which is sort of extended the process fortunately there was a little bit of progress\nAnd so what kind of a First Amendment violations or do you how would I mean this is obviously a simulation but how what what kind of rights or do they give up here\nSo I gave up their five main parts of the first one\nAlways come in with friends and they always expect to stand by their friends and just be able to chat with them the whole time but we take those rights away so our dictator a lotta times splits people up and make some do likes staring contest with people that don't even know and they're not allowed to just speak and say whatever they want and yeah they're not allowed to stand by their friends which makes the event really fun and different and\nYou got a lot of volunteers who do this for the pizza\nOh yeah absolutely I think we had about two hundred students come through today so it went really really well\nTalk about the lesser now you're hoping to convey here\nSure so even people in our organization have trouble naming the five parts of the first amendment so we hope when students come in they can kind of having a fun experience and just be able to really realize and why it's important that these first men's been shouldn't be used and she'll be remembered\nTalking to a tailor made for journalism major and president of the society of professional journalists you W Eau Claire chapter talking about a a a free speech exercise a First Amendment exercise on the campus a log students to\nTrade away for ten minutes their First Amendment rights in exchange for some free pizza and I believe a soda is involved as well this is an annual event right how long has this been going on in a choir\nOh gosh long before my time I couldn't tell you exactly but we've had faculty members who claim they were around when this was still going on so long long time\nAnd uh is this something that you find as a ... a journalism major a member of the society for a fresh will journalists are inspiring to think about the impact of of the first amendment\nOh yeah of course especially as a journalism major to press is obviously involved so literally my livelihood is included in the first amendment so this means a lot to me and my organization\nWho who was involved here as the uh the dictator and the uh the goon squad\nOr so we always ask people by organization first and then normally we need more volunteer suddenly reach out to all of our student\nMedia a teeny ten sponsored us today as well as the student newspaper the spectator oh we get our student radio involved so we love to get all of the media down to help out\nAnd do what kind of reactions did you get from the students who who did this to their\nWell everyone always seems a little scared when they first walk up to the booth we have a dictator his name was ... she did a great job but he's in a big beard and a big costume and yelling at everybody and telling them to do things that\nThey clearly look uncomfortable doing so they always look a little nervous coming up but once they leave they always are like well that was fun and now I get my free lunch and I did learn a little something so that's really fun from our perspective\nWhat kind of lessons are you hoping people take away as they are they much on the pizza and walk away\n[laughter] well we hope that they at least learn their first five amendment our first ... five parts of the first amendment to um we hope they learn those we hope they realize why they're important\nI'm like I said people love to come in and some other friends and without that part of the first amendment you can't do that you can't just say what you want you can't practice whatever you want to so we hope when they walk away munching on their pizza they realize how important those five parts are and how important this utilize them\nDo you know this is something that's unique to your campus there in a ... or something that happens elsewhere to I've never I've never run into it anywhere else\nI think it happens we um took it actually from a university from I think California or something like that um we're the only ones in Wisconsin that I Know up so that's why we're really excited about it\nAnd uh I don't know what to grade your or what the level of school are you are you going to be participating in this in this in the future yourself Taylor\nI'm a senior so I'll actually the rains all over but I have participated the last four years\nAnd do you do other things out throughout the year geared toward promoting a freedom of the press and another First Amendment issues\nYeah in the spring as it has to big events um this is the one in the fall in the spring we like to put on I'm a big a forum and we love to bring like professors and faculty\nLast year we did women and journalism I'm this year it'll probably be something about voting so in the spring we like to put on a big foreign ... bringing community members and press and faculty to kind of talk with students about the importance
