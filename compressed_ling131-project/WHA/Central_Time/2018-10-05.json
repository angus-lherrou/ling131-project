than eleven thousand people in threatened to become a global pandemic look back at the response to that outbreak and see if health agencies around the world are better prepared to deal with deadly viruses today\nFirst August and September is massive flooding around Wisconsin cause more than thirty seven million dollars of damage that's according to an assessment from FEMA which toward the state last week\nAnd Governor Walker has sent a letter to the White House to ask for federal assistance as Wisconsin counties recover from the ... a lot of rain our next guest is here to talk about the damage and recovery efforts Andrew back into the public information officer with Wisconsin emergency management Andrew welcome back to the central time\nGreat to be here thanks for having me well Andrew are we\nWasn't that long ago and we're looking more rain now but round up for the kinds of damage we saw around Wisconsin\nOh we've seen a great amount of damage to roads especially many highways the county level in state as well saw some damage with you know washed out culverts shoulders that receive damage pavement that buckled in areas especially\nThat saw flash flooding a and a lot of homes where had significant amount of water in their basements and some that even had water on the first floor of their homes as they were buried under the water from rivers that rose out of their banks so it's an extensive amount\nOf damage that covers a pretty wide area across the southern and central parts of the state\nAlso had a series of tornadoes in high wind events in late August that caused damage from trees being down falling on buildings as well so quite a variety of damage a quite a bit that FEMA looked at when it was here in the state last week and quite a bit that many communities are still working to recover from it this time\nRight long term a lot of this is going to take a while to bounce back from but for the short term critical stop how are we doing around the state as far as the immediate damage and and getting things back to normal\nAnd well many of the homes private homeowners are are still working to recover right now I was out with the but teams when they were in the state last week and and we saw a lot of contractors working on properties is they're still trying to remove some of the debris from homes that flooded I was working to replace drywall that was damaged or to dry out areas\nAnd replace appliances that received damage as well likewise we've also got ongoing work on on some of the roads that were damaged or some of those routes are still closed but it but some of them as well have moved forward with doing repairs when funding is available at this time\nIn order to make sure that those major routes get reopen the most notably would be a highly fourteen in western Dane County towards a black earth area uh making sure that that major route gets opened again as soon as possible\nNow there's damage was dramatic and now this a request for federal help it there's there's a process here can you talk about uh what Governor Walker has written to the federal government about what a what that might get rolling now\nSure the governor's request comes after FEMA teams and the small business administration were in the state last week and they traveled around with state officials and local officials as well\nRight so one of the first things that went wrong if people didn't really know what they were looking at a a Bola is endemic to the Congo river basin right now there's an outbreak as you mentioned in the Democratic Republic of Congo\nIt's popped up in the republic of Congo Uganda places like that in Central Africa that this is this these West African nations had never seen anything like it\nAnd it's it's as if uh you know the difference between Central Africa in western Africa is the difference between\nSeattle and Miami I mean they're a continent apart and the communication is not the same as it is here in the United states so people didn't know what they were looking at to begin with which helped to spread the\nSecond was the three countries that were affected are the poorest in the world or the GDP of Liberia is about one percent of what is the GDP is here in the United states that\nPer capita that is so you know instead of living on an average of about fifty thousand dollars a year imagine if you were living on five hundred dollars a year or that poverty helps the disease spread as well\nOr both throughout the rural regions and in a very slum heavy a major cities and these were this was also the first time they both came to a place\nWhere a air travel is possible to major cities around the world you know there are direct flights from a ... the capitals of all three countries to Europe and to the middle east and to the largest cities in Africa\nOr you know we live in a globalized world now a place where any bug is just an airline connection or two away from New York or Beijing or or any other major city in the world\nThe world Health Organization as an organization that people would turn to a ... in hopes that they could support a disease like this once it becomes known I got a lot of criticism for Nevada slow bureaucracy a slow response can you talk about what they did a ... in New York in ... when I put down there\nSo to begin with the world Health Organization mobilized a few teams to go look at at what this virus was that was raging in the rural hills of of guinea and they thought they were looking at maybe a cholera outbreak or again I mean they didn't expect a boa because nobody had ever seen the ball in this particular\nArea of the world Health Organization eventually a race to a number of of authorities into\nGuinea Liberia and eventually Sierra Leone but only after months and months in which the virus ended up growing one big stigma and all this is the the World Health organization started out by telling everybody in West Africa that if you've got a bully you would die a bowl of will kill you\nWell that's not the message they really wanted to send what they wanted to say was a if you get Ebola you have to get treatment and then maybe you have the opportunity to survive\nI'm they the the initial messaging of if you get ... you're going to die meant that anybody who came down with a disease was more likely to hide from the uh the world health authorities are then cooperate with them and go to in the boat treatment unit because who wants to die in a sterilized space you know far away from your family\nBut as the way it works is that as somebody get sicker and sicker they are more infectious to other people around them so as your family is carrying for you if you've got sick they are then more likely to get infected as the days go on a ...\nHave to have to take place and this is a culture where a burial it means a lot where where the traditions of a dressing and preparing your your loved ones for the afterlife is hugely important\nAnd therefore about Seventy percent of the cases where transmitted er during the the burial to the funeral process\nSo the world Health Organization started out by ... by warning people about how deadly this virus was instead of telling them how important it was to get treatment or once they figured out that mistake they both told people to get treatment and they taught people how to uh to safely bury their dead which was a huge important\nAspect of this one of the things that I find most interesting in the course of researching this was that that you know the hard sciences helped come up with a chore over well with a vaccine for the virus but it was really the soft sciences things like anthropology and actually understanding the culture with which you're interacting or that probably save even more lives\nTalking to read Wilson author of epidemic Ebola and the global scrambled to prevent the next killer outbreak that reminds me of a a common theme from your book\nFor authorities they want to take decisive action they want to be seen as taking the size of action they don't want to do things that cause people to panic or behave in ways that are going to make things worse and this is true in West Africa or in the United states when there was a case spotted in taxes\nCan you talk about how how to thread that needle\nYeah and and this I think comes a lot from\nA who the president was at the time my mom remember that back before the last\nThe last two years in which we're all of our hair has been on fire nonstop we had President Obama was a big hit his nickname was no drama Obama and he wanted to sort of convey the sense that the U.S government had this if if the bullet came to the United states\nIt would be under control quickly well that\nWas it let people wanted to hear they wanted to hear some urgency and some are some decisive action uh that would protect the country from what a lot of people thought was this threat but let's not forget and you know in the summer of ... fourteen when Ebola was really blowing up in West Africa\nThere was also this group of Mad Men running across Iraq and Syria called the Islamic state that we're taking over everything in sight or that was that was a pretty scary time in in the United states go back and read the news clips and everybody was a pretty on edge so the the fact is\nThere there's a dual dual side here to this point of trying to make sure that people will call and and nobody's panicking but at the same time showing the urgency and the and the action that a government needs to take\nA to do actually do something and contain a virus or a group of terrorists in the middle east or something like that there's a really delicate balance here that the Obama administration tried to strike\nThey got it wrong in the beginning but I think at the end they they did it right in that sense you know the world's best organizational force if you will or the U.S army over to West Africa a free thousand Americans went over to build a bullet treatment units and then all of those three thousand not a single one got sick\nI Want to talk about early warning systems as we look at the future uh you write in your epilogue there are a lot of blind spots in the world where the public health authorities would detect the disease until I started to spread what could we do about that\nYeah so the bowl a supplemental bill after bill that Congress passed by to pay for uh the the response to the outbreak in West Africa it contained a provision that helped the Centers for Disease Control and prevention pay for what we're effectively many Centers for\nDisease Control and prevention is in about forty nine countries around the world and I'm Talking about countries like Congo and like a a lot of the free West African countries\nAnd and uh you know South Asian nations where a a bird flu might emerge or something like that a South American nation is why they're dealing with\nAn outbreak of yellow fever in Brazil and that's important because the global public health\nChain is only as strong as the weakest link and there are a lot of really weak links out there\nAre we the United states has the best public health system in the world uh you know we don't really experience outbreaks ... the health as it exists in the United states\nIsn't really the same concept as it is in sub Saharan Africa or south east Asia where you know death is is unexplained and in that happens a lot more often\nThan it does here at an earlier age under circumstances that always that aren't always understood so the fact is we need these early warning systems around the world we need somebody watching whether it's a bird market in China\nOr whether it's a a a you know they they do the slums of of West Africa or of a or a Rio de Janeiro\nOr something is going to come next we don't know what it is the world Health Organization's actually designated the unknown as a research priority they call it just these acts which is a nice and scary title but I think that might steal from my next book uh but that there is there is something else coming we don't know what it is\nBut fewer and fewer people will die or as we make sure if we make sure that we're watching for it before it becomes a full blooded pandemic\nIn our last minute and a half or so looking back at the reaction to Ebola then do you feel like the world is more prepared now for a disease acts whatever it might be\nIn the world is in fact more prepared and that's because of really great organizations like the Americans the Centers for Disease Control and prevention or the world Health Organization did a remarkable amount of\nA self examination just trying to figure out what they did wrong and now they have a new a direct threat that is effectively for things like epidemic response that there's shipping tons of you know dozens of people hundreds of people into the Democratic Republic of Congo right now so we're getting better\nBut the fact is we're not there yet and what comes next is not going to be a ...\nIt's probably going to be a flu it might be something that's so easily transmissible by a cough or sneeze the fact is we just we have to be ready not just in Central Africa not just in West Africa but in every part of the globe because international borders don't get a lot of respect for the virus that can't\nRead thanks a lot for joining us today you gotta think family\nThat's read Wilson national correspondent at the hill we've been talking about his book epidemic Ebola and the global scramble to

Thanks for having me well what led you just set out on this road trip finding the food not famous restaurants around the country these places that most of us might overlook\nWell so I Am a big fan of ah the holding the wall restaurant um and and I I don't know if your listeners um travel this way but I always go to a new city and I'll do like a fancy meal and one night\nAnd then the next day I Try and find that\nHole in the wall place that mom and pop restaurant\nUm you know some ... food truck something that's a ... really embedded in the community and it's not always um sort of written about or or you can find on line\nAnd and after you know years of doing that I kind of came to this relationship realization that\nYou know we write so much about the the celebrity chef driven restaurants\nUm and we'd right very little about the other side of a restaurant cuisine I'm even though the food there can be just as good if not better um and so I thought what would it be interesting if I could do this journey and and my curiosity was um was there a story to tell\nAnd and I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that there were stories to tell\nBefore we get to those stories I got to ask I Would love to eat at those places where they go traveling I don't know how to find them how do you find that great at all in the well\nThat's the beauty of it is that you know in this day and age where we have the Internet and all these lists and everything that a lot of these places are still hidden you know so so you can't go the traditional way I'm a lot of ... asking locals for me it's it's it's going someplace\nYou know finding some locals that you trust and and you think have good palate you know\nUm and then invested so you kind of kind of be like a little bit

that\nWonderful dishes like the the the pinnacle of the journey and and for me it's it's just the beginning because if I'm In a restaurant and I really enjoy the food um I ... my curiosity goes nuts you know and and and I want to know more about\nThe person behind the dish or the culture behind the dish or or who is responsible for why why is this year um and then you know my next curiosity sometimes it's like why do why don't more people know about this um why isn't this place like you know a a a on every TV show\n'em and and so that that to me it's just like a Dr seuss listen at the end of the if you love food um you have to love the people that make the food right\nUm so I'm I'm I'm just infinitely curious about the decisions people maker especially a lot of the immigrant families that I talk to and how they got here and\nHow they that they uphold these recipes or how these recipes change because they got here um and and I just ... every story is so unique um and and I really enjoyed sort of meeting these people along the way\nYeah that you you find many immigrants along the way some of them at restaurants summer are home cooks to help what is ... and you see a lot of great American food being driven by immigrants in particular what is it that's happening there\nWell it's it's you know it's the passion for for for preserving you know I think what happens with every immigrant group and is the same with my parents right you you come here\nUm and then you get homesick right and and so you can't go back to\nTurkey or Korea or Mexico or or you know Poland or wherever you come from and so you use food as you are in the stalled ya right food is sort of your your gateway to like you know the homeland and it's it's it's the cheapest way right to to to sort of relive a memory I'm In and for often for many immigrants\nFlying back home once a year or twice a year it's not an option I'm so really it it becomes about the food and and the food is not just\nAbout nutrition or nourishment it's about like linking something to a a former life and and ... that's that that's a that's a very deep you know and and so you do find the stories and the food because through this food you're going to hear the stories of the homeland and how they got here and why they got here\nOr can you share one of your favorite stories from one of those immigrant costs yeah\nOne of the uh one of the first chapter that I wrote is when the first chapters that'd be searched or was in I'm In law in Massachusetts and ah I was a it's a pretty large Cambodian commute ...

very much\nThe very basis for Iran getting back a hundred and fifty billion dollars thanks to the uh two thousand and Fifteen\nOr Iran nuclear deal but the bad blood of the United states refusal to return to shot as well as to a return the assets lead then to the storming of the U.S embassy in Tehran and ultimately the taking of a U.S hostages for four hundred and forty days\nAt the end of the Nineteen seventies and in the early Nineteen eighties that then of course leads to the rupture of diplomatic relations\nOr rendering in many ways the Nineteen fifty five treaty I'm In in in several different I mentioned to be a fairly a I'm a void at that point\nThat's a whirlwind tour of us around history there why does this Nineteen fifty five treaty between us and Iran end up in the news in twenty team now\nWell because it still was a valid treaty it was still on the books and ah it's important to remember that despite the fact that formal diplomatic relations had been severed thanks to ah the the the hostage crisis uh there was\nThat the United states has with Iran or it allows especially a pursuant to the treaty for some level of uh\nOf interaction both at the consular level as well as through economic relations\nThe more important reason why secretary palm peyote took this uh action wasn't to go ahead and get rid of a treaty that uh he sought to be obsolete a but really because it became the main justification to allow Iran to take\nAny kind of dispute it had with the United states\nTo the international court of justice and in fact that's exactly what it did when it came to the U.S withdrawal from the er the Iran nuclear deal\nSeeking to have a sanctions that were then imposed against Iran lifted a pursuant to that treaty being a a major impetus to do so [noise] the ... international\nCourt of justice ruled in favor of Iran and what is seen by many around the world is rather ... to act\nOr the United states then decided to withdraw from that treaty\nDoes not have been a two way street uh has the United states the United states have used this treaty to apply pressure on Iran ... through the same international court of justice\n[laughter] they could have but they thought that there was no real need to because of the fact that Congress had already imposed a significant sanctions\nAnd given the fact that other congressional action action has been\nMade it's a very difficult for other countries and companies to do business with a with Iran so essentially a the ... uh international court of justice was seen as really super flu as to what the United States already felt that it could achieve a from Washington\nTalking about the current state of us sanctions on Iran and the and the nuclear deal that now the United states has basically left\n[noise] well there's two levels of the sanctions or as as we know a few months ago or the United states a reinstated in what's called snapback fashion\nA sanctions on a on Iran these were going to go ahead and affect certain sectors of a Iranian society but the more crippling sanctions are yet to come which is going to be within the next month or so and that's going to specifically target or a two areas of courses\nOil and the other is they're going to be a their ability to do any kind of financial transactions\nIn the global market so these are seen as efforts to try to bring Iran to its knees I'm quite frankly I'm not sure what Iran has left to really do a given the fact that it has a not only still maintained its a\nCompliance with the er the Iran nuclear deal\nBut according to a international observers as well as the international atomic agency or Energy Agency has been in full compliance of that or this seems to be a much more motivated by an effort to placate or American regional allies uh\nThan it is really to try to bring Iran into some kind of compliance or or or acquiescence\nThe Trump Administration has talked about Iranian offenses outside of that nuclear deal support for rebel groups terrorist groups in the middle east region in particular\nA ... as the main criticism I effort that blister missiles which were not as I understand it covered under the nuclear deal so seeing Iran as a bad actor even if they're conforming to the letter on the line the nuclear deal is there anything to that\n[noise] well I think from one perspective one can certainly make the argument that uh that Iran or certainly doesn't operate with very clean hands or its support of a ... and the Syrian campaign being won a it's a sponsorship and\nPretty openly Lebanon and to a certain degree Hamas within the Palestinian territories and also within the new arena or the support of the who the rebels in Yemen a each of these is seen as a bone of contention for the United states either directly\nOr for its regional allies but at the same time it's important to remember that uh American allies within the region\nHave certainly a used their leverage with the United states and their alliance or to prosecute or some might even say persecute\nUs rather egregious conduct or in the name of pushing back\nOn Iran particularly we see this happening with so the and the United Arab Emirates policy uh in Yemen a it is done under the pretense of trying to be a bulwark against Iranian aggression there are but it seems as though it has many more dimensions\nThan just a

five years ago killed more than eleven thousand people and threatened to become a global pandemic look back at the response to that outbreak and see if health agencies around the world are better prepared to deal with deadly viruses today\nFirst August and September is massive flooding around Wisconsin cause more than thirty seven million dollars of damage that's according to an assessment from FEMA which toward the state last week\nAnd Governor Walker has sent a letter to the White House to ask for federal assistance as Wisconsin counties recover from the onslaught of rain our next guest is here to talk about the damage and recovery efforts Andrew back into the public information officer with Wisconsin emergency management Andrew welcome back to central time\nGreat to be here thanks for having me\nWell Andrew I we all remember those floods like they were yesterday wasn't that long ago and we're looking more rain now but round up for the kinds of damage we saw around Wisconsin\nOh we've seen a great amount of damage to roads especially many highways county level in state as well I saw some damage with you know washed out culverts shoulders that received damage pavement that buckled and areas especially\nThat saw flash flooding a and a lot of homes where had significant amount of water in their basements some that even had water on the first floor of their homes as they were buried under the water from rivers that rose out of their banks\nIt covers a pretty wide area across the southern and central parts of the state\nAnd also had a series of tornadoes and high wind events in late August that caused damage from trees being down falling on buildings as well so quite a variety of damage a quite a bit that FEMA looked at when it was here in the state last week and and quite a bit that many communities are still working to recover from it this time\nRight long term a lot of this is going to take a while to bounce back from but for the short term critical stop how are we doing around the state as far as the immediate damage and I'm getting things back to normal\nAnd well many of the homes private homeowners are are still working to recover right now I was out with the teams when they were in the state last week\nAnd and we saw a lot of contractors working on properties as they're still trying to remove some of the debris from homes that flooded I was working to replace drywall that was damaged or to dry out areas\nAnd replace appliances that receive damage as well likewise we've also got ongoing work on on some of the roads that were damaged or some of those routes are still closed but it but some of them as well have moved forward with doing repairs when funding is available at this time in order to make sure that those major routes get reopen and most notably it would be\nA highway fourteen in western Dane County towards the black or the area or making sure that that major route gets open again as soon as possible\nNow there's damage was dramatic and now there's a request for federal help but it there's there's a process here can you talk about uh what Governor Walker has written to the federal government about what a what that might get rolling now\nRight so one of the first thing that went wrong if people didn't really know what they were looking at a ... is endemic to the Congo river basin right now there's an

the GDP of Liberia is about one percent of what is the GDP is here in the United states that per capita that is so you know instead of living on\nAn average of about fifty thousand dollars a year imagine if you were living on five hundred dollars a year or that poverty helps the disease spread as well or both throughout the rural regions and in the very slum heavy a major cities and these were this was also the first time they both came to a place\nWhere a air travel is possible to major cities around the world\nYou know there are direct flights from a ... their capital's of all three countries to Europe and to the middle east and to the largest cities in Africa I Know we live in a globalized world now a place where any bug is just an airline connection or two away from New York or Beijing or or any other major city in the world\nThe world Health Organization as an organization that people would turn to a ... in hopes that they could support a disease like this once it becomes known I got a lot of criticism for Nevada slow bureaucracy a slow response can you talk about what they did a ... in New York in ...\nSo to begin with the world Health Organization mobilized or a few teams to go look at what this virus was there was raging in the rural hills of of guinea and they thought they were looking at maybe a cholera outbreak or\nAgain I mean they didn't expect a boa because nobody had ever seen the ball in this particular area or in the world Health Organization eventually a race to a number of of authorities into\nGuinea Liberia and eventually Sierra Leone but only after months and months in which the virus ended up growing\nOne big stigma and all this is the the World Health organization started out by telling everybody in West Africa that if you've got a bully you would die Ebola will kill you well that's not the message they really wanted to than what they wanted to say was a if you get Ebola\nYou have to get treatment and then maybe you have the opportunity to survive\nI'm they the the initial messaging of if you get it you're going to die meant that anybody who came down with a disease was more likely to hide from the uh the world health authorities on then cooperate with them and go to in the boat treatment unit because who wants to die in a sterilized space you know far away from your family\nBut as it the way it works is that as somebody get sicker and sicker they are more infectious to other people around them\nSo as your family is carrying for you if you've got sick they are then more likely to get infected as the days go on a and as if when burial practices have to have to take place and this is a culture where\nA burial it means a lot where where the traditions of a dressing and preparing your your loved ones for the afterlife is hugely important and\nTherefore about Seventy percent of the cases where transmitted er during the the burial to the funeral process so the world Health Organization started out by ... by warning people about how deadly this virus was\nInstead of telling them how important it was to get treatment or once they figured out that mistake they both told people to get treatment and they taught people how to uh to safely bury their dead which was a huge important aspect to this one of the things that I found most interesting in the course of researching this was at that\nWith a chore over well with a vaccine for the virus but it was really the soft sciences things like anthropology and actually understanding the culture with which you're interacting or that probably saved even more lives\nTalking to read Wilson author of epidemic Ebola and the global scrambled to prevent the next killer outbreak that reminds me of a a common theme from your book\nFor authorities they want to take decisive action they want to be seen as taking decisive action they don't want to do things that cause people to panic or behave in ways that are going to make things worse and this is true in West Africa or in the United states when there was a case a spotted in taxes\nCan you talk about how how to thread that needle\nYeah and and this I think comes a lot from a who the president was at the time my mom remember that back before the last\nThe last two years in which we're all of our hair has been on fire nonstop we had President Obama was a big hit his nickname was no drama Obama and he wanted to sort of convey the sense that the U.S government had this if if the bullet came to the United states\nIt would be under control quickly well\nThat was it let people wanted to hear they wanted to hear some urgency and some ah some decisive action uh that would protect the country from what a lot of people thought was this threat but let's not forget and you know in the summer of ... fourteen when Ebola was really blowing up in West Africa\nThere was also this group of Mad Men running across Iraq and Syria called the Islamic state that we're taking over everything in sight or that was that was a pretty scary time in in the United states go back and read the news clips and everybody was a pretty on edge so the the fact is\nThere there's a dual dual side here to this point of trying to make sure that people will call and and nobody's panicking but at the same time showing the urgency and the and the action that a government needs to take\nA to do actually do something and contain a virus or a group of terrorists in the middle east or something like that there's a really delicate balance here that the Obama administration tried to strike they got it wrong in the beginning\nBut I think at the end they they did it right or in that they sent all the world's best organizational force if you will or the U.S army over to West Africa a free thousand Americans went over to build the bullet treatment units and then all of those three thousand not a single one got sick\nI Want to talk about early warning system as we look at the future uh you write in your epilogue there are a lot of blind spots in the world where the public health authorities moody detected disease until I started to spread what could we do about that\nYeah so the bowl a supplemental bill that's the bill that Congress passed\nBy to pay for uh the the response to the outbreak in West Africa it contained a provision\nThat helped the Centers for Disease Control and prevention have for what we're effectively many Centers for Disease Control and prevention in about forty nine countries around the world and I'm Talking about countries like Congo and like a a while the free West African countries\nThat we're talking about Liberia guinea and Sierra Leone and and uh you know South Asian nations where a a bird flu might emerge or something like that or South America nations where they're dealing with\nAn outbreak of yellow fever in Brazil and that's important because the global public health\nChain is only as strong as the weakest link and there are a lot of really weak links out there\nAre we the United states it has the best public health system in the world uh you know we don't really experience outbreaks the ... the\nHealth as it exists in the United States isn't really the same concept as it is in sub Saharan Africa or south east Asia where you know death is is unexplained and and that happens a lot more often than it does here at an earlier age and under circumstances that always\nIs we need these early warning systems around the world we need somebody watching whether it's a bird market in China or whether it's a a a you know they they do the slums of of West Africa or of a or a Rio de Janeiro or something is going to come next we don't know what it is\nThe world Health Organization was actually designated the unknown as a research priority they call it disease X which is a nice and scary title but I I think that might steal from my next book are but there is there is something else coming we don't know what it is\nBut fewer and fewer people will die or as we make sure if we make sure that will watch him for it before it becomes a full blooded pandemics\nIn our last minute and a half or so looking back at the reaction to Ebola then do you feel like the world is more prepared now for the disease acts whatever it might be\nIn the world is in fact more prepared and that's because of really great organizations like the Americans the Centers for Disease Control and prevention or the world Health Organization did a marketable amount of\nA self examination just trying to figure out what they get along and now they have a new a direct threat that is effectively for things like epidemic response there there's shipping\nTons of you know dozens of people hundreds of people into the Democratic Republic of Congo right now so we're getting better but the fact is we're not there yet and what comes next\nIs not going to be a bowl it's probably going to be a flu it might be something that\nThey'll easily transmissible by a cough or sneeze the fact is we just we have to be ready not just in Central Africa not just in West Africa but in every part of the globe\nBecause international borders don't get a lot of respect for the virus that can't\nRead thanks a lot for joining us today\nYou gotta think family\nThat's read Wilson national correspondent at the hill we've been talking about his book epidemic Ebola and the

important back story when you think back about some of the food you ate if a kid or while traveling or maybe meeting an important new person they likely still means something to you today because of the memories they hold\nChef Edward leaf spent two years traveling around the highways and by ways of America his mission to sample some great food and to gather the untold stories of small restaurant chores immigrants and small town America\nAnd we're leaves the chef and owner of several restaurants in Louisville, Kentucky he's been nominated for James Beard award several times you may have seen them up here on the PBS series the mind of a chef his new book is buttermilk graffiti chefs journey to\nDiscover America's new melting pot cuisine Edward thanks a lot for joining us today Thanks for having me well what led you to set out on this road trip finding the food not the famous restaurants around the country these places that most of us might overlook\nWell so I Am a big fan of ah the whole ... restaurant um and and I I don't know if your listeners um travel this way but I always go to a new city and I'll do like a fancy meal one night\nAnd then the next day I Try and find that\nHole in the wall place step mom and pop restaurant\nUm you know some ... food truck something that's a ... really I'm embedded in the community and it's not always um sort of written about or or you can find online\nAnd and after you know years of doing that I I kind of came to this really is a realization that\nYou know we write so much about the the celebrity chef driven restaurants um and we'd right very little about the other side of a restaurant cuisine I'm even though the food there can be just as good if not better\nUm and so I thought what it would it'd be interesting if I could do this journey and and my curiosity was um was there a story to tell and and I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that there were stories to tell\nMe forget to those stories I got to ask I Would love to eat at those places where they go traveling I don't know how to find out how do you find that great at all in the well\nThat's the beauty of it is that you know in this day and age where we have the Internet and all these lists and everything\nThat a lot of these places are still hidden you know so so you can't go the traditional way I'm a lot of ... asking locals for me it's it's it's going someplace\nYou know finding some locals that you trust and and you think have good palate you know um and then invested so you kind of kind of be like a little bit of an investigator you've really gotta\nYou know a a sniff it out and and every town has won every city has them I'm just got to put it in the leg work and and and some you know like I I've eaten in some bad places to you know sometimes and wrecked um but you got to be willing to strike out every once in a while to\nNow there's a part to eat the food but at least for this book and I suspect you probably do that in general you talk to the people cooking you try to get their stories I what what led you to want to do you\nDo that too it's funny um\n[noise] a lot of times people think that that um the end of the journey is you know the finding the great meal right in an eating that wonderful this is like the the the pinnacle of the journey and and for me it's it's just the beginning\nBecause if I'm In a restaurant and I really enjoy the food um I just am it my curiosity goes nuts you know and and and I want to know more about\nThe person behind the dish or the costs\n... why why is this here um and then you know my next curiosity sometimes it's like why do why don't more people know about this um why isn't this place like\nYou know a on every TV show 'em and and so that that to me it's just like it dries it was a list at the end of the day if you love food\nUm you have to love the people that make the food right\nUm so I'm I'm I'm just infinitely curious about\nThe decisions people maker especially a lot of the immigrant families that I talk to and how they got here and how they that they uphold these recipes or how these recipes change because they got here um and and I just every story is so unique\nUm and and I really enjoyed sort of meeting these people along the way\nThat you you find many immigrants along the way some of them at restaurants summer are home cooks to help what is ... and you see a lot of great American food being driven by immigrants in particular what is it that is happening there\nWell it's it's you know it's the passion for for for preserving you know I I think\nWhat happens with every immigrant group and is the same with my parents right you you come here um and then you get homesick right and and so you can't go back to turkey or Korea or Mexico or or you know Poland or wherever you come from and so you use food as you were in the stalled ya right food is sort of your\nYour gateway to like you know the homeland is it's it's the cheapest way right to to to sort of re living memory\nI'm an end for often for many immigrants\nFlying back home once a year or twice a year is not an option um so it was really it it becomes about the food and and the food is not just\nAbout nutrition or nourishment it's about like linking something to a a former life and and eh that's that that's all that's very deep you know and and so you you do find the stories in the food because\nThrough this food you're going to hear the stories of the homeland and how they got here and why they got here I'm sure one of your favorite stories from one of those immigrant ...\nYeah so one of the uh one of the first chapter of the road is when the first chapters I researched was in I'm In law in Massachusetts and ah I was ... so I'm pretty large Cambodian commute extra very large Cambodian community\nThat lives in ...

the movement of Deir ...\nRobert Mintz there is a state wide living in storytelling editor for the USA Network Wisconsin he's based in Wausau Rob welcome back\nHere I think you\nLet's start with this a department of transportation story this is an investigative reports Milwaukee Journal sentinel gets a little complicated by twenty Fifteen apparently the farm and transportation paid a lot of money for work but that didn't happen talk us through the story\nThat sort of tape paid twice for work that did happen the same work um so so it will this is from uh uh the investigative reporter Raquel Rutledge of the Milwaukee Journal sentinel she got a bunch of\nDocuments internal emails and um and other other internal reports\nOr to show this and I'm the amounts to a more than four hundred thousand dollars in this payment that the state made um what happened was in the ... there's a lot of complex is used by what what basically happened was in the\nThis these giant contracts that the state had four it's\nTwo hundred million dollars you interchange project [noise] they were charged twice for the same thing within that contract they raised that with the a construction company at a construction company complained about it and then the ... ultimately the state ended up um just go ahead and paying four hundred thousand dollars\nRight and apparently in in these documents at least some people in the department of transportation knew that they were doing this but it that there was some diffusion of responsibility I guess\nYeah yeah they definitely knew they absolutely knew so the so it was it was raised by one of the project engineers um the uh I'm a deal he pointed it out to the construction company and said um we we want to remove this\nUh they said that that sure you can remove that but it there will be a fifty two thousand dollar administrative fee or to make that change to the to the contract the DOT said well that sounds like a lot of that doesn't make sense and then time pass and then instead of\nA arguing about that ministry and a fee or paying the fifty two thousand dollars the state just went ahead and pay the full amount\nNow the the report it solves in the journal son was worth reading and digging into the details but I Want to bring it up to now is there talk of digging deeper into this by the states are concerned that he did we do this month that might have happened another time\nOr expect you know whether whether they're a long time craft beer drinkers you know one craft beer first started becoming a saying or whether they're new craft beer drinkers people want an October fest\nBut we did as we did last time we talked to we had a WPRI testing team to look at some of your recommendations a and we'll start with one a traditional ah German October fest I here's all this and that the ah that are a team put together here [noise]\nBritish start with this I'm going to say vines to honor to be ... the German\nOctober fast I Will pass it on the left hand side as is the cost them the German so they're\nDoing now around the correct pronunciation is going to act the way I just started and you can really take a shot I mean that's my ... he made the ... the ones the leadership here by the phone [laughter] I kind of thing\n[laughter] ...\nIt's not as ... as some other are we're it's got more of a ... flavor to it there's a little bit of like a Christmas managed to\nDo this feel like a fall beer or two people\nI don't know I'd truthfully I it doesn't feel am I to me as something that feels more summer I went something a little heavier\nTalk a little bit Kyle by others lives to fodder fest beyond what the gang had to say first of all the nailed the pronunciation is\nGood yeah like if you want to be really want to read at the German and I got out of it right yeah that W is of eastern vines to honor is is pretty much the way you do it so um yeah it's definitely more like a ... that's usually actually the mall that's used to to make a beer like that as a pills in a ... um [noise]\nUm but yeah I it part of the reason why people say well why not to wear fest actually starting in October and that's because they pushed it into nicer weather or over the years outdoors right and I like well we don't want to put it in the cold weather so we're going to move it in in in in in ... you know back in the county or a little bit so it's in September so the fact that it's\nKind of a summary beer still is more or less appropriate oh that cutting clean Chris finished that is what you want if you're going to drink a couple of them frankly and there are there are a lot I mean I I assume the answer's yes a lot of German October fest beers\nYeah yeah so there's there's six breweries in Munich that are really always closely associated with October fest and an plenty more in the you know in the larger state of Bavaria including ... eh let's move over to the United states you talked about how it's a little different here for American brewers here uh\nMetropolitan after burner and here's a listen to the guy\nSays this is an American October fest metropolitan Bruins after burner October fest\nLoggers next he's seen can we request Stein phone to cut the sign budget last year the southern tastes like on October ... it doesn't mean anything hasn't had much later\nMaybe that's compared to last beyond the pretzels give yourself a suck\nI mean they're going after taste but it that's more flavorful frustrated but it still doesn't feel like after\nThe end I get a little bit of multi this yeah it's it's definitely more multi than the vines to find her was in a bit of a copper e flavor to\nNot a bad beer and it's just not distinct in any way\nCertainly easy to drink\nTheir this one from Chicago yeah they cut out a the cubs references around for a good a time and so but this was on your list do you want to make the case with us so yeah so one thing I Would I Would ask and I mean I'm just totally guessing as if it's a little on the colder side you're going to lose some of the early nuance in the in the beer flavor in beer was like straight out of the fridge\nOr straight off of the really cold tap you're not going to get as much of those early notes but once it's been in your mouth for a few seconds are going to start to have those open up a little bit I don't know is that common with an October fest beer you want to not average temperature most beers frankly you don't want to recommend fridge temperature if you want to actually taste all of the the flavors that the birds put into um the colder it is the lesser going up I mean\nThat's why a debate macro beers are always saying hey look it up cold are beers are when you drink them because they taste good okay All right I Know how about some other American uh we'll get to Wisconsin and another good American October ...\nYou know you you really want to aim for the the mid west in my opinion it's where all the you know we're all the German immigrants typically a landed I'm\nBurned city is another brewery in in Chicago that does some nice sort of continental European styles um\nYou'll you'll find a bells or a ... other reason in Michigan that'll that'll do a good um October fest as well plays a lot of German here yeah yeah in fact there's a an October fest festival in Michigan that was the first one sanctioned by the city of Munich outside of Germany\nFailing it to the F as I can remember I never met again isn't because I I don't think of a direct but every our lives yeah it it was the first one that got the official sort of perimeter of the of the government\nTalking about fall beers in October fest beers a towel and the bill see from its miss a here's another one from the w._b. our beer tasting team we brought this one a little closer to home to Wisconsin [noise]\nNow we have is a little closer to home\nNuclear is staggered form October Sam mullet on by the fun because this is my favorite October when\nThe for the author of front [laughter] fun\nNot in any way I'm biased towards the ... I'm On\nThis one like Lawrence me out playing on the like I drink it and then like out from my stomach I just feel like the warm spreading that's a good feeling you can almost smell it is you're taking a sip smells like a fall here this is what I think I think and I taught for ...\nYeah it's definitely got a slightly heavier flavor it's not heavy and creamy and the texture but the flavor is definitely a a little bit stronger\nThis is when they can drink like lying and baking empire sitting by the fire these are all things that I've done with this fear it's just like it's very homey you want to come up with a blanket and just like hang out and\nHave a beer in the mall\nWas the winner of the October fest they tried to their uh does that and maybe some other good Wisconsin ... no ... there and the ...\nYeah so damn carry the the ... at a nuclear is has a lot of history brewing in Germany so it doesn't shock me at all did that\nA beer that resembles an older more traditional style of German October fest beer would\nWould appeal to people that he would do it well hum and you'll find a a number of beers like that from brewers that stick really closely to the traditional Bering styles are Ellis Island was another one I'm dean coffee there and then his and his crew auto 'til the day they're they're all pretty um\nThey're they're pretty close to the style a guidelines and so the ... in October fest for male asylum another one that I really like from Wisconsin ... um similar in that sort of nutty toasty a little bit warming maybe slightly higher I'll call them ...\nAnd we checked out a non October fest 'cause there's fall beers that are not October fest here's a here's a listen to a sub venturing out into a stout land [noise]\nAnd we have one that change of pace beer for you know I fall seasonal for folks who\nDon't like October fest [noise] this is central waters this thing in Wisconsin here a brew house coffee stout\nSo I actually have had this fear before and I love this fear the big finally encourages happy [laughter]\nMurder or homicide or am I don't I mean lots of good sound of your own minds I mean there was really good smells better than coffee\nFor me and I do a lot of coffee that it could be a lot of clean air\nAct some half and half [laughter] I think in the perfect balance I hate when they're due to creamy and this is like a light one that I could I could maybe have another one and not call it after that I I really like that\nI agree I'm not a huge so fan um they normally they want to take a nap [laughter] right I'm drinking but this one like murder case that I can drink two or three of these are just really good\nIs actually I can see like a burger or something you're going to win just one beer and then you're feeling falling right there don't want to have anything else eight you're not hungry anymore and that's when you don't get that\nOff so I Love the vines to fonder but as far as fulltime beers go this coffee stuff might\nBe I think my favorite beer well we'd\nAll right thanks everybody thinks\nAbout that coffee stout and some other non October\nFest ought to be sure yeah the the center waters perhaps coffee stout is is a really great\nA fulltime beer when they when they ... they don't necessarily always grew at every year but they usually do and it's\nIt's a really nice price point on top of being a really good beer from a bird that knows what they're doing um you know if you've ever had their Peruvian morning which is basically a copy stuff that's been bourbon barrel aged you know how how great that beer is um and the the basic roast coffee started just a really\nClean drinking not too expensive for the size of the bottle kind of beer um another one I'm really looking forward to this year is I think a a brand new one from a nuclear is their chocolates that they've done a coffee before um this year they're doing uh chocolates doubt\nUm which I can only assume all feature both chocolate mole which are actually chocolate but then also some variety of chocolate or ... or something like that and it as well and so\nAnother very well balanced kind of mid western stout similar to the central waters

bourbon barrel topple back in my basement that I Will probably crack open that sounds great Kyle thank you so much always good to talk with you thanks very much\nAt the end of the Nineteen seventies and in the early Nineteen eighties that then of course leads to the rupture of diplomatic relations or rendering in many ways the Nineteen fifty five treaty I'm In in in several different that I mentioned\nTo be a fairly a I'm a void at that point\nThat's a whirlwind tour of us around history there why does this Nineteen fifty five treaty between us and Iran end up in the news in twenty team now\nWell because it still was a valid treaty it was still on the books and uh it's important to remember that despite the fact that formal diplomatic relations had been severed\nThanks to uh the the the hostage crisis uh there was still some level of connectivity that the United states has with Iran or it allows especially a pursuant to the treaty for some level of uh\nOf interaction both at the consular level as well as through economic relations\nThe more important reason why secretary palm peyote took this uh action wasn't to go ahead and get rid of a treaty that uh he sought to be obsolete a but really because it became the main justification to allow Iran to take any kind of dispute it had with the United states\nTo the international court of justice and in fact that's exactly what it did when it came to the U.S withdrawal from the uh the Iran nuclear deal seeking to have a sanctions that were then imposed against Iran lifted a pursuant to that treaty being a a major impetus to do so [noise]\nThe ... international court of justice ruled in favor of Iran\nAnd what is seen by many around the world is around ... to act or the United states then decided to withdraw from that\nKnow has the United states or the United states have used this treaty to apply pressure on Iran ... through the same international court of justice\n[laughter] they could have but they thought that there was no real need to because of the fact that\nCongress had already imposed a a significant sanctions and given the fact that other congressional action\nAction has been made it's a very difficult for other countries and companies to do business with a with Iran so essentially a the ... uh international court of justice was seen as really super flu as to what the United States already felt that it could achieve a from Washington\nTalking about the current state of us sanctions on Iran and ... and the nuclear deal that now the United states is as basically left\n[noise] well there's two levels of the sanctions or as as we know a few months ago\nOr the United states are reinstated in what's called snapback fashion\nA sanctions on a on Iran these are going to go ahead and affect certain sectors of a Iranian society but the more crippling sanctions are yet to come which is going to be within the next month or so and that's going to specifically target or a two areas warn of courses\nOil and the other is going to be a their ability to do any kind of financial transactions in the global market\nSo these are seen as efforts to try to bring Iran to its knees I'm a quite frankly I'm not sure what Iran um has left to really do\nA given the fact that it has a not only still maintained its a\nCompliance with the the Iran nuclear deal a but according to a international observers as well as the international atomic agency or Energy Agency has been in full compliance of that or this seems to be a much more motivated by an effort to\nPlacate or American regional allies are than it is really to try to bring Iran into some kind of compliance or or or acquiescence\nThe Trump Administration has talked about Iranian offenses\nOutside of that nuclear deal support for rebel groups terrorist groups in the middle east region in particular\nUh and and the main criticism effort that blister missiles which were not as I understand it covered under the nuclear deal so seeing Iran as a bad actor even if they're conforming to the letter on the line in the new deal is there anything to that\n[noise] well I think from one perspective one can certainly make the argument that uh that Iran\nAre certainly a doesn't operate with very clean hands or its support of a ... and the Syrian campaign being won a it's a sponsorship and patronage of of Hezbollah\nUh pretty openly in Lebanon and to a certain degree Hamas within the Palestinian territories and also within the new arena or the support of the who the rebels in Yemen a each of these is seen as a bone of contention for the United states either directly or for its regional allies\nBut at the same time it's important to remember that uh American allies within the region have certainly a used their leverage with the United states and their alliance\nOr to prosecute or some might even say persecute or some rather egregious conduct or in the name of pushing back on Iran particularly we see this happening with so the and the United Arab Emirates policy\nOr in Yemen a it is done under the pretense of trying to be a bulwark against a Iranian aggression there are but it seems as though it has many more die mentions than just a the Iranian factor\nOr document cited con from Wayne State university about America's relationship with Iran after the U.S announced it is playing out
