another poll has ... with the lead\nSo how much of an effect will these proposals have on voters ... an associate professor of political science at Marquette University and director of the Marquette democracy lab\nOf course thanks for having me well\nBefore we dig into the policy proposals from our Governor Walker and a superintendent Uber's with the Democrats talking about a one in New tax cuts with the governor the Republican wanting to restore some education funding or abused can be sure to reach over and and get some independence here as opposed to most just directed at thrown bases\nI think that's right I think if you look at recent polling data and this isn't new this is a long standing trend Republican candidates do well amongst Republican voters democratic candidates do well among democratic voters\nAnd so although I Would say that this election is very much going to be a turnout um elections so on Republicans and Democrats are going to do everything they can to get their um their supporters out at the margins reaching out and being able to persuade some independent voters ... it could be the ... election\nOr that's the politics a little bit so I Would look at some of the policies are talking about now or Governor Walker said yesterday if he's reelected he'll restored this speed commitment to funding school to two thirds of the total cost\nA superintendent ... the

Wisconsin nights were not so concerned about the spending side they were interested in the tax cuts side\nFast forward a few years and over the last year polling here in the state what we're seeing is that Wisconsin nights are concerned about kind of these basic services and whether or not on the funding is there to support schools to provide infrastructure improvements\nAnd the like and so I think what we're seeing from Governor Walker in particular is is this recognition that this is a slightly different political climate that he's um he's looking at in the ... election fight\nOf course if you look back in the previous elections he ran in in years that were pretty good for Republican candidates nationwide where we're seeing on this year if you look at the special elections and so on that

I Would be sad\nThough I wasn't out with my friends who are not cool ball or beside the older my cooking was relating can pets my friend she's done an amazing past debate or I'd be upset I'm not going to the gym as much as my friend who's ready gained some odd\nSo but the summer and all of those things just combined to leave me feeling crappy\nAnd I've seen the case made on Facebook in some cases but maybe this is ... Instagram that we're getting the carefully edited and treated best of somebody else's life and then comparing it to our own everyday life all this stuff is that part of the problem\nAbsolutely so you know it's it's very easy to uh to know that consciously set to sit there and go well no you know I'm sitting here on a Tuesday night looking at ... but yeah my friend posted one picture and the whole of the last week and it was the highlight their entire week I'm comparing that to me on a ... cheese diet like\nObviously yes you'll you'll not going to come up with that but the problem is it's it's not a conscious thing you know you you can tell yourself is but ... all the same\nThat doesn't help you still have the fear of missing out you have this feeling you are inferior you you often have to say how you know when I took my son likes that which I posted to fight last week I was faking it for the cameras I was during the off the face but they\nLook really high they say you know they they they must be really feeling\nAnd then it's going to be a spiral right or if I'm In that zone then on my next pick for that I posed I'm going to really try to upped the ante in and make it even better picture so it's ... and then I'll put my feeling on everybody else\n[laughter] exactly so that you really do get you get this a toss it competition\nAnd you just get well you get the end result ... which is a social network ... ... ... documents affection\nAnd documents protection in a very relates away mates unlike perhaps you know traditional broadcast TV glossy magazines eight aids perfection all your friends and if they're not your real friends in real life they're often people who feel like they could be your friends\nYou know they feel relates will they feel like they all have a very similar life to use all of which makes that uh that ...\nPeople make all the harder to actually stand up to\nYou feel this on Instagram a lot of people feel this on Instagram what do you think is the solution is there a better way to use this service or use apps stance or when it comes to the service\nYou know I've actually I've know come up with all the ... uh about half the people I spoke to who say that they love and grime said that they found that the best thing to do is to focus on friends and family to use it not as a way of looking at these puff it influences with beautiful buddies and incredible lives but\nThe other half said exactly the opposite they said the problem was that your friends and family sharing you know the lovely meals a day go on that's what really gets you because you know you could be doing that you really do your friends and family at least influences at least these plastic a multiple celebrities\nWith then you can know that you're not living that life you can touch them for inspiration but you can distance yourself a bit of a sudden they suddenly I I had to introspection and I found that it was the friends and family who who are actually the ones who made\nMost and it was it was very much for the fear of missing out saying it was great I think that's the thing that really ... ... to me was when I saw two of my friends together having fun I always always felt like why didn't they invite me why wasn't I the ...\nProbably because I Know I'm ... I'm buddy I like staying on the sofa\nSo how do you do have you yourself loose from Instagram do you email pictures to people if you have a picture you want to see how do you how do you manage this now\nI I I Do use it threw out a lot less than I used to offer this um I have\nPartially because I Can't quite bring myself to unfold I friends and family because\nYou know I'm ... I'm not just feels to me so rather than stocks that confrontation I've just stop type thing the apple that much I use ... uh I quite like the the direct communication is that I feel like I'm you know I I I send it to people who want to see pictures but\nI Try and to the post things and to the east side of it last I Try and be a bit more direct to focus with my communication and also you know I I Am actually just trying to spend less time on my phone and see the low ... fall\nAsleep at all and it's just sort of thing which would sound terrible coming from around it so it's but it's kind of true\nBig picture Alex do you think we've just dived\nInto all forms of social media little to have long and maybe we need to do what\nYou did in this ... I think it'd be intentional about how we use it\nYeah I you know I really do I think that uh the change in the world over the last decade has seen huge extremely quickly and\nLargely unintended unintended even by that creates these\nThese products and services uh I don't think we'll be using these tools the same way and at that time and I think that will be because you know some other new hunting us as your place and I think we're going to get to the ... will come in it will be seen as just in the same way the same as\nThey call it if you don't leave your house for two weeks it will start to be seen as just a told if you're the person who is\nPolling when done well you should get a good scientific sample so you can represent the opinions\nAnd that's different from self selected mobilization which is just going to get the people who feel really strongly so we began with good polling actually we begin with preparations on an issue where we have an advisory group representing different points of view and we prepare materials\nThat have arguments for and against different policy options that are going to be the subject of the poem um we vet those uh\nUh so that uh there are loose should redouble an accurate sometimes we also have a video version in case some people are are not so literate or to make the same information accessible\nThan what we do is we take a good survey\nWith this with about those a policy options and the reasons why people might support or oppose an option\nThen what we do it so that's the ordinary polling but then we build on top of that we actually recruit people to come to a single place well either face to face or sometimes it's on line with videos small group discussions like Google Hangout or other software\nBut usually face to face a three hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred seven hundred people a good sample or of the population divided into small groups a randomly divided so they're diverse with trained moderators who don't offer any opinion\nBut just facilitate a a mutually respectful discussion a and discussion is of the policy options the pros and cons and then they come up with questions that they direct the panels of competing experts and politicians\nWho offer a competing answers to the question is only to the questions to the people and then we alternate let's say it's a whole weekend and we alternate an hour and a half a small group an hour and a half plan or another hour and a half small group another hour and a half planetary until we work through the whole agenda and the people are really\nNot only had a dialogue with the experts in politicians but with each other and they learn to listen to each other even though people from different points of view normally now\nIn this polarized world don't talk to each other at all and they don't consult Web sites that will give him the other point of view ... here they actually listen and talk and then they take the\nSame at the end of the weekend I'm saying it's a weekend for a cause that's been that's the usual a format at the end of the weekend they take the same survey that they did on first contact and we see the changes of opinion and maybe two thirds of the time the opinions change significantly sometimes very dramatic\nAre they considered judgments says the people of a representative and inform samples so we put all of America or California or as you mentioned\nMongolia I'm just back from ongoing all among goalie in one room or even all of the European Union or twenty seven countries at the time now twenty eight maybe going back to twenty seven\nUm but the whole population in one room where it can sing together reason together and listen to each other and then decide what they really think in individual confidential questionnaires like secret ballots\nSo that in other words that's what the people would think if they were thinking um and it's usually pretty smart it may not be what I think or what any individual uh thanks but they usually have good reasons for the conclusions that they come to\nA gym ... through the new book democracy when the people are thinking revitalizing our politics public deliberation\nAnd James let's talk about the different kinds of solutions so when we have a choice in a pool in election usually the range of options narrowed down to you know two or three by political parties vie politicians by experts things like that\nDo you see different solutions different a trade off I mean when people deliberate like this well\nYes well usually a look at this a referendum it's just yes or no parties have programs and usually if they have coherent positions their packages\nOf policies put together and say you can just wrote vote for one package or another but in the deliberate poll we can this aggregate we can separate out all the options and pro each of them individually so if you look at a particular party you might like\nSomething in this like two or three other things and then you'll have to decide\nHow much you care about the thing you're like well no willpower on each individual item and with the arguments for and against each individual item\nWe can get a quaint nuanced a picture of of what the people are really want and I'm a separate out the packages and get the get policymakers to think about um uh what they really should do a and it becomes a what I call a\nRoute to responsible advocacy this\nIs what the people wanted and here's why and if you as a policymaker actually interested in listening listening to the people\nYou hear of the reasons that you can cite that really weighed heavily with the sample or after we put the whole population of the whole country in one room to think about it\nRight you got this group of people was representative sample of speech a country European Union whatever they've come out with their recommendations on whatever you might be in practically in your experience then what do their reports going a file cabinet or do they actually lead to a policy changes\nWell I'll tell you a few cases are going way back in some very recent where they results were very consequential so uh years ago in Texas uh we um uh the I'm\nA public utility commission we worked with them and the eight ah then regulated utilities about how Texas was going to get its energy or for electricity coal natural gas\nOr a wind power a conservation piping and the stuff from Mexico those were the main options although sometimes the nuclear came up at a later point and the earlier point well so everyone's surprise the

about what addict to belt is 'cause a lot of people will never have encountered that yeah\nSo there are plastic belts um the the Dictaphone machine was invented in Nineteen forty seven so through the forties fifties sixties and seventies\nScreenwriters doctors businessmen would use the Dictaphone machines to record correspondence notes scripts and it's a a plastic delta ... it's a piece of plastic I think it's about six inches wide and uh it can contain you know up to Fifteen sixteen minutes of\nMaterial and they put it on a machine and talking to the microphone and it would impress a groove onto the plastic\nAnd low it can you talk about the significance of having rod Serling voice talking about what he wanted to a film others on his TV show OR Books or whatever\nThat was great and so one of the really cool things is how unrehearsed addictive outs are so we're very used to hearing starlings voice as this very polished kind of all powerful\nNarration in whether it be the twilight zone or night guy so when you first tune into these dip developed and kind of uncertainty and in rough it's just you have this kind of immediate and\nCounter to what you're used to in so that tells you a lot more about the person\nAnd what kind of stuff do hear rod Serling saying on the news\nIt's Breivik riding mostly scripts and it's very um very technical so he's staying he's ... all the stage directions all the punctuation but you also see you also have an excuse me here\nCorrespondents or\nI've even heard him kind of dictate to do list I'm too as assistant Marjory I'm and so you it's a broad variety but it's mostly scripts well\nLet's give a listen now to the voice of rod Serling on one of these dictators ... recordings\n[noise] hiring looking down on this memo in that [noise]\nCash a large vapor died she should avoid el up after [noise] funding blending with the white person [noise] that ... dollar that you're just dial up after lending with whitefish of the world [noise] a nurse enters most over the bed [noise]\nChecks for post [noise]\nStudies the removal profile\nMemos says [noise] what is it this time question mark a syringe into a quick question like a syringe question why aren't you question [noise] or just more of [noise]\nTribal tiptoeing tribal tribal right here I Am a writer I took tours in and out because our question mark [noise]\nPart of your company and said hey we've got this rod Serling spoken word poetry [laughter] I Would have believed you listen to him that he's a ... there was a rod Serling style here right\nYeah yeah it's amazing I mean he started dictating his scripts early in his TV career and that was his preferred way of working so he didn't sit at a typewriter and and type it out and they make changes it's just coming straight from his mind onto the ticked about\nWhat's it like to listen to these recordings that were you a twilight zone watcher before this yard gallery or\nUm twilight zone directly I started um examining gallery as well which has been a fun discovery right um\nIt's just the first one I heard he addresses his assistant directly in the first six seconds and you're just suddenly in the\nAge of hearing him talk to you and it is like he is talking to you and you do get totally immersed in the storytelling and so it means that the corrections and the punctuation are very jarring when you finally hear them\nUm and you do kind of take a step back and try to figure out exactly what he's doing\nAnd your first reaction is surely he's reading off of something 'cause it's stuff like the question marks and the quotes you eat it surely that's not all that is that Mary\nUm but then you find out that it is and then you hear him\nI'm kind of ... about like what quality of olive after he wants to go for it and so it's this again this kind of wonderful mix where you kind of hear his genius that he can just kind of go on these long monologues about human nature and then also not remember what he named someone in a previous stick developed\nStarting to marry ... holding from your W Madison looking at these ... of sterling dictator belt recordings in this effort to keep them preserved them for the future and very what I talk about that this is the kind of technology that isn't going to last forever\nRight that's a part of the reason we we wrote a grant and we're lucky enough to get a grant from the council of comes on library and information resources they got money from the Andrew W Milam foundation to to hand out these grants\nThat took the boats are plastic and like any plastics they deteriorate and they've started to deteriorate enough to make a worry about them but also the machines are being made anymore so it's a challenge to find people who who can digitized them\nSo right now if I was a film and TV researcher\nProcess at work I'd have to come here right and was yeah and hope you have a working six of them is that right yeah that's what I mean of course\nOn these assessments to anyone because we don't have a working Viktor Bout machine and you also need to be really careful digitizing any legacy material whether it's audio or video or film\nThat you have the proper equipment and the proper expertise do that and we just didn't have that so ah we worked with a company called scene savers\nUh um and they've done a fabulous job for us\nSo they're all digitize now is that right or are we on the way\nYeah all the ... have been digitized as well as we have ... collection a as well as another screenwriter aging in species and the producer Walter wings or\nWow and so how do you know if I'm that film and TV researcher or what to what we can I Do or how can I access\nTo the go to the Wisconsin Center for filling in theater research and talk to marry [laughter] um I\n... from the very least you can just um request ahead of time and you can go and listen to them on a boom box they're um they're certainly ones are still in that process of coming out more publicly so you get in contact with Mary\nAmericans talk about the value of artifacts like this for American culture\n[noise] yeah I mean\nThis is such a unique recording for ... and um people don't often save these you know it's remarkable that\nUh Serling and Marjory lands for his assistant save them and thought to send them to us I'm usually these just got tossed after a they had been transcribe so we would be missing out on hearing the voice and hearing the process\nCan you talk about that because there are probably a lot of artists out there I mean going back centuries where you'd love to be able to hear their voice at work or we can see the final product of the money is that it what is it like being able to watch it developed in stages\nWell one thing and it's not too I'm just credit Serling zone work or Trump us one thing that's really interesting is the insight you get into the process and the multiple people involved in the process\nHas one thing that kind of unsung hero for me of studying addictive belt is Marjorie Langford or in the case of trauma he had to friday assistance mostly his family\nUm transcribing these for them but you can also here based off of the way that certainly in terms of speak to them and also the tasks that are being granted to them how heavily involved these assistance and secretaries and chocolate first work in the creative process\nOn and so that was a really I think it really hard to deny their influence when you hear them getting a directly addressed you're hearing the tasks that are given to them and you remember that we would not have these\nRecords or the script even without their contribution so that's been my favorite and most um fruitful insight I think that I've done some transcribing and it is grueling work yeah social when somebody speaking in your ... at the site of their thoughts not going down for you\nYeah yeah so uh what what is next how are you hoping these ultimately did used\nMarry well we're hoping that uh scholars both television and film scholars will come to Madison to listen to them to not only gain new insight into ... career but the screen writing process um you know how\nFilm and television developed a especially in the late Nineteen sixties uh I think there's just a myriad of ways that people could use these\nBefore we wrap up where we have you gone back and watch the episodes you for being detailed and watch it\nAnd the original I got I think he ran a kind of ... harder to find that the ... he has extensive stick it out on ... I have been kind of compare and contrast to the guy that I Wish we had like five\nMinutes entering lake or that kind of see what drastic changes they're hiring like carry over and things like\nHe's a registered nurse at a an emergency hospital down here in Miami\nAnd his daughter is eleven years old born here or she speaks three languages and is a quite an accomplished piano player and she is just beside herself just a you know very articulate a young lady and trying to explain\nThe situation that they're in and she says she talks about having to go back to Haiti where she's never benches and speak Creole she has no idea what she would do their\nUm or does she stay here when her parents go back and then she's forced to either\nLive with another family or she put it'd be thrown into the system and have a foster family or something like that and and the worries of that ... that that brings with it so yeah it's just really interesting to see it first hand and to understand to hear the debates that they're having and I can tell you that\nThis one family is is is embodiment of what's going on in thousands of households around the country um as as as they are legal as they were made in this legal limbo and they face that very real prospect of having to be ordered back home um possibly soon depending on how quickly the legal cases are resolved\nAlan Gomez is immigration reporter us\nShe's including the temporary protected status program I may be coming to an end for many people protected under that program Allan you mentioned the legal limbo a lot of what the Trump Administration has changed and immigration has gone to the courts where does this temporary protected status program stand in terms of legal challenges and actually being implemented\nYeah so this is just one of the many a times by the Trump Administration to limit both legal and illegal immigration that has a let's say run into some hiccups in the courts I'm a federal judge a couple of weeks ago on California a rule that the administration you used a flawed legal reasoning\nA flawed process um to end the program um and in that ruling a judge Edward Chen a made clear that he felt and there was enough evidence to show that the administration may have used quote\nAn atom is against non white non European immigrants to reach its conclusion I'm into reach its decision to end this program so he prevented he stopped it so basically right now TPS is it remains active these people can stay here there are there they can stay here legally to live and to work\nUm and now we started the process now goes to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals um and then it could go from there to the Supreme Court\nAnd it's important to note on that since the judge made reference to Trump's a previous comments are when it comes to you know who the president used a very choice words when talking about Haiti at one point\nUm and he's and he's and he's made many comments about immigrants coming from Central America the judge based his argument based his ruling in part on those arguments but it's important to know what the Supreme Court\nHas ruled on something similar or if you remember the travel ban from last year of the court's stopped the administration from ... one thing that travel ban based on his racial animus\nOr perceived at the time but the Supreme Court just this past June finally gave approval to the travel ban and disregarded those comments um that was a five four majority ones when Justice Kennedy was still in the court\nBut every indication is that justice Kavanaugh would kind of lean in that same direction so the the the administration may end up being vindicated here if it when it reaches the Supreme Court um it's just a question of how quickly it gets there and and how Kavanaugh will rule on that one\nOne question witness temporary protected status is okay even if the initial disastrous earthquake a bat is in the past him and recovered from in the same place to go back and you did a little uh a survey you run up a survey kind of of the six countries in question here talk about the conditions in those countries and what people would be going back to\nYeah and that's one of the central things about this debate right here um do you do you base your decision to extend the country's TPS status on that original reason that it was granted TPS so let's see if Haiti again for an example\nThe reason they were placed armed are granted TPS status was the ... earthquake um that just decimated Haiti um the admit you know the administration has has previous administrations\nUm have ruled that hey maybe the the effects of that earthquake their past that but ever since Haiti has been hit with a massive cholera outbreak it's been hit by\nTwo hurricanes I'm an continues just experiencing tragedy after tragedy so the ... and the Obama administration because of all that said\nLook things are still terrible right right now this country is not prepared\nTo absorb forty six thousand Haitians that are living in the United states under TPS status um what the Trump Administration is saying is hey they're past that earthquake we're sorry but it's time for you to go back this was a temper\nOr um situations and and all the countries Nepal for example I'm just had its earthquake\nI'm three years ago and reconstruction there is by the best estimates by the Nepalese government is that about forty to fifty percent back to their back on live from that earthquake [noise] um yeah the Trump Administration said no it's it's good enough we can send them back\nTo El Salvador Honduras these are places that rank the top ten of murder rates around the world right now I'm so while the fight was there was not what got them there are TPS designation to begin with\nUm again previous administrations that argued okay well sending pens and in the case of El Salvador two hundred thousand\nPeople back there is not the wisest thing to do and will be putting these people in harm's way so each of these countries still face major challenges and the question is whether they can absorb these these these massive numbers of people going back to their countries\nFor talking to Alan Gomez is immigration reporter at USA Today we're talking about the temporary protected status program which would end under a Trump Administration plans for around three

central time\nOf course thanks for having me well before we dig into the policy proposals from our Governor Walker and a superintendent ...\nWith the Democrat talking about wanting to do tax cuts with the governor the Republican wanting to restore some education funding or these candidates try to reach over and and get some independence here as opposed to mess just directed at their own bases\nI think that's right I think if you look at race polling data and knew that long standing trend or how can candidates do well among Republican voters democratic candidate it well\nAlthough I Would say that this election is very much going to be a turnout elections so I'm Republicans and Democrats are going to do everything they can to get their um their supporters out at the margins reaching out and being able to persuade some independent voters ... it could be the ... election\nOr that's the politics a little bit so I look look at some of the policies are talking about now or Governor Walker

these basic services and whether or not on the funding is there to support the schools to provide infrastructure improvements\nAnd the like and so I think what we're seeing from Governor Walker in particular is is this recognition that this is a slightly different political climate that he's um he's looking at in the ... election fight\nSupport for WPRI comes from fifty four thousand members

I Would be sad though I wasn't\nOut with my friends who are not cool ball or beside the older my cooking was relating can pets my friend who's done an amazing past debate or I'd be upset I'm not going to the gym as much as my friend who's ready gained some odd so but the summer and all of those things just combined to leave me feeling crappy\nAnd I've seen the case made on Facebook in some cases but maybe this is ... Instagram that we're getting the carefully edited and treated best of somebody else's life and then comparing it to our own everyday life all this stuff is that part of the problem\nAbsolutely so you know it's it's very easy to uh to know that consciously set to sit there and go wild no you know I'm sitting here on a Tuesday night looking at ... but yeah my friends posted one picture and the whole of the last week and it was the highlight their entire week I'm comparing that to me on national they choose diet like\nObviously yes you'll you'll not going to come up with that but the problem is it's it's not a conscious thing\nYou know you you can tell you selfish but all the same\nThat doesn't help you still have this fear of missing out you have this feeling you are inferior you you often have to say that oh well you know when I took my son likes that which I posted to fight last week I was faking it for the cameras I was during the off the face\nBut they look really high they say you know they they they must be really feeling\nAnd then it's going to be a spiral right or if I'm In that zone then on my next picture that I posed I'm going to really try to upped the ante and and make it even better picture so it's ... and then I'll put that feeling on everybody else\n[laughter] exactly so that you really do get you get this a toss it competition and you just get well you get the end result ... which is a social network ... ... ... documents perfection\nAnd documents affectionate very relates away mates unlike a house you know\nTraditional broadcast TV glossy magazines eight aids perfection all your friends and they're not your real friends in real life they're often people who feel like they could be your friends you know they feel relates will they feel like fail having a very similar life to you all of which makes that uh that comparison that people make\nAll the harder to actually stand up to\nYou feel this on Instagram a lot of people feel this on Instagram what do you think is the solution is there a better way to use this service or use apps [laughter] that's or when it comes to the service\nYou know I've actually I've not come up with an all sit on the way\nAre about half the people I spoke to who say that they love and ... said that they found that the best thing to do was to focus on friends and family to use it not as a way of looking at these puff it influences with beautiful buddies and incredible lives but just to keep up with the people they really care about\nThe other half say exactly the opposite they said the problem was that your friends and family sharing you know the lovely meals a day go on that's what really gets you because you know you could be doing that you really know your friends and family at least influences at least these puffing a multiple ... parties\nWith then you can know that you're not living that life you can talk to them for inspiration but you can distance yourself a bit of a sudden they suddenly I I I had of introspection that I found that it was the friends and family\nWho who are actually the ones who ... me most and it was it was very much for the fear of missing out saying it was great I think that's the thing that really ... ... to me was when I saw two of my friends together having fun and always always\nWhy wasn't I the facts on probably because I Know I'm I'm buddy I like staying on the sofa\nSo how do you do have you yourself loose from Instagram do you email pictures to people if you have a picture you want to share how do you how do you manage this house [laughter]\nI I I Do use it threw out a lot less than I used to offer this um I have ... because I Can't quite bring myself to unfold and friends and family because you know I'm British wait wait terribly polite I'm not just feels to me so rather than stock that confrontation I've just stopped type thing now all that much I use ...\nUh I ... like the the direct communication is I I feel like\nUm yeah I I sat and actually the people who want to see pictures but\nI Try and to the post things and to the east side of it last I Try and be a bit more direct to focus with my communication and also you know I I Am actually just trying to spend less time on my phone and said whoa fall asleep and all of this this whole thing which sounds terrible coming from ... to it but it's kind of truth\nBig picture Alex do you think we just\nDived into all forms of social media little to have long and\nMaybe we need to do what you did in this piece think and be intentional about how we use it\nYeah I you know I really do I think that\nAh the change in the wild over the last decade has seen huge extremely quickly and largely unintended unintended eaten by to create these\nThese products and services uh I don't think we'll be using these tools the same way and at that time and I think that will be because you know some other new hunting us as your place than\nI Am I going to get to the societal laws will come and it will be seen as just in the same way the same as\nA holiday if you've got to leave your house for two weeks it will start to be seen as just a told if you're the person who is on social media all the time more so than his posting certain types of contact us you know\nBecause the public hasn't talked very much about the issues the good thing about polling when done well you should get a good scientific sample so you can represent the opinions and that's different from self selected mobilization which is just going to get the people who feel really strongly so we began with good polling\nActually we begin with preparations on an issue where we have an advisory group representing different points of view and we prepare materials\nThat have arguments for and against different policy options that are going to be the subject of the poem\nUm we vet those uh uh so that uh there are loose should redouble an accurate\nSometimes we also have a video version in case some people are are not so literate or to make the same information accessible\nThan what we do is we take a good survey\nWith this with about those a policy options and the reasons why people might support or oppose an option then what we do\nIt it's so that's the ordinary polling but then we build on top of that we actually recruit people to come to a single place well either face to face or sometimes it's on line with videos small group discussions\nLike Google Hangout or other software but usually face to face a\nThree hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred seven hundred people a good sample or a population\nDivided into small groups a randomly divided so they're diverse with train moderators who don't offer any opinion but just facilitate a a mutually respect for discussion a and discussion is of the policy options the pros and cons\nAnd then they come up with questions that they direct the panels of competing experts and politicians who offer a competing answers\nTo the question is only to the questions to the people and then we alternate let's say it's a whole weekend and we alternate an hour and a half a small group an hour and a half planetary another hour and a half small group another hour and a half planetary until we work through the whole agenda and the people are really\nNot only had a dialogue with the experts in politicians but with each other and they learn to listen to each other even though people from different points of view normally now in this polarized world don't talk to each other at all and they don't consult Web sites that will give him the other point of view will\nHear they actually listen and talk and then they take the same at the end of the weekend I'm saying it's a weekend for a cause that's been that's usual a format at the end of the weekend they take the same survey that they did on first contact and we see the changes of opinion\nAnd maybe two thirds of the time the opinions changed significantly sometimes very dramatically those final opinions are they considered judgments as the people of a representative and inform samples so we put\nAll of America or California or as you mentioned Mongolia I'm just back from ongoing all Mongolian one room or even all of the European Union\nOr twenty seven countries at the time now twenty eight maybe going back to twenty seven\nUm but the whole population in one room where it can sing together reason together and listen to each other and then decide what they really think in individual\nConfidential questionnaires like secret ballots so that in other words that's what the people would think if they were thinking um and it's usually pretty smart it may not be what I think or what\nThey usually have good reasons for the conclusions that they come to\nTalking to James fish and all through the new book democracy when the people are thinking revitalizing our politics through public deliberation\nAnd James let's talk about the different kind of solution so when we have a choice in a pool in election usually the range of options has been narrowed down to you know two or three by political parties vie politicians by experts things like that\nDo you see different solutions different a tradeoff need when people deliberate like this\nWell yes well usually a look at this a referendum it's just yes or no parties have programs and usually if they have coherent positions\nTheir packages of policies put together and say you can just wrote vote for one package or another but in the deliberate poll we can just aggregate we can separate out all the options\nAnd pro each of them individually so if you look at a particular party you might like something in this like two or three other things and then you have to decide how much you care about the thing you're like well no will power on each individual item\nAnd with the arguments for and against each individual item we can get quite new launched a picture of of what the people are really want\nAnd I'm a separate out the packages and get the ... and get policymakers to think about um\nUh what they really should do a and it becomes a what I call a route to responsible advocacy this is what the people wanted and here's why\nAnd if you as the policy maker actually interested in listening listening to the people\nYou hear of the reasons that you can cite that really weighed heavily with the sample or after we put the whole population of the whole country in one room to think about it\nSo you've got this group of people was representative sample of the country a European Union whatever they come out with their recommendations on whatever the issue might be impractical you and your experiences then why do their reports going to file cabinet or do they actually lead to policy changes\nWell I'll tell you a few cases are going way back in some very recent where the results were very consequential so uh years ago in Texas uh we um uh the I'm\nA public utility commission we worked with them and the eight a than regulated utilities about how Texas was going to get its energy for electricity coal natural gas\nOr a wind power\nA conservation piping and the stuff from Mexico those were the main options although sometimes the nuclear came up at a later point and the earlier point well so everyone's surprise the a percentage in the projects the public's willingness to pay more on its monthly bill\nTo support wind power even if that was just slightly more was went from fifty percent to eighty five percent um and so the public utility commission and the legislature instituted a series of changes over the years that led Texas\nFrom being last among the fifty states number fifty to being number one in wind power by two thousand and seven surpassing California um and so\nUh that was implemented and has been good for the states have all that wind powered keeps growing and growing ah last up a couple of months ago or South Korea where we had done a some earlier projects a\nFace this big choice when the new government came in the new government was anti nuclear but I'm a they had these two nuclear reactors shouldn't gory five and six that were partially constructed already and we're expected on line and we're going to keep\nAllow them to avoid a investing and a lot of fossil fuels and so there were clear arguments on either side but the government had committed itself\nTo getting rid of nuclear power um and so they decided to my amazement they said we're going to let the people decide and they've spotted a quite rigorously national deliberate poll\nA as a people move decisively a fifty nine percent are supporting the continuation of the construction of the two nuclear reactors um for the reasons that I just alluded to and that's what the government accepted\nThat it was there was a hard choice and they said let the people the side so that people did\nWe're talking to James fish can his new book is called democracy when the people are thinking talking about the idea of deliberative polling getting people together representative groups of people together to learn about and discussing issue and see where they stand\nYou can join in at eight hundred six four to one two three four do you have a question for James about how this works in practice is this an idea that you think could improve our political discussions is there an issue you'd want to try this on in your local community in your state I Do have concerns about how this might work\nCalled eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four to
