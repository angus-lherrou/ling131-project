up\nHear from you W researcher who's taking a closer look at the August storms that caused flooding around the state and at the risks facing communities in the future first it's time for our weekly look at the big stories in national politics Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations is resigning her post at the end of the year\nA top Republican is introducing a bill that would fund the Mexican border wall and both major parties are assessing their political fortunes in the wake of a highly partisan confirmation process for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOr question of the week for you is do you think the Kavanaugh confirmations will affect the voting next month if you're a Republican are you more excited to vote after seeing how things played out or viewing democratic do you feel more motivated you're neither neither none of the above is this going to affect your vote let us know at eight hundred six four too\nFour to one two three four or email ideas at WNPR dot org\nScott Long as the senior staff writer for the hill where he covers House Republicans and Scott welcome back to central time thanks for having me well UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced this week that she'll be resigning her position there at the end of the year\nOrdinarily you know a two year term for you and bathrooms this wouldn't be huge news but uh what do we know about the story\n[laughter] that's right and in fact she apparently told Trump at the start of her tenure that she probably would only stay for a couple of years and it's not unusual for people to move on\nI think what's ... what's unusual here is that the timing of her announcement it came on the heels of a huge Republican victory\nThe Senate was able to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and so I think a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill and elsewhere in town we're a little baffled about wind Nikki Haley chose to make this announcement on that particular day it sort of stepped on the message\nA of Republicans as they were celebrating their victory on Kavanaugh\nNow let's look a little bit at Nikki Haley she's coming out of the Trump Administration looking pretty good a lot of people in other positions were effectively fired or they were seen in some ways is tainted either for Republicans in general or for pro Trump Republicans in particular she is coming out pretty good it looks like\nYeah if you look at a you know other cabinet secretaries who resigned and scandal Tom Price that ha chess or Scott Pruitt at the EPA\nUh they they were not given a any face time with the president as they made their eggs that are from the White House the same goes for other chiefs of staff and other communications directors\nA Nikki Haley got a pretty good treatment from President Trump there was a sit down at the White House between the two of them that was televised they both had kind words for each other\nA and I think that's significant because a lot of people have been talking about Nikki Haley because she was sort of a Trump critic back in twenty sixteen before her appointment to the to you at the un\n[laughter] well that's right I mean the president Mitch McConnell other Republicans in the house and Senate up and down the ballot are calling out those protesters as\nAn angry left wing mob a you know they're basically warning or or instilling trying to instill fear and voters that handing power to Democrats this November will be handing power to a dangerous out of control mob of an artist\nA and so it it has been a common talking points from uh from Republicans from conservatives\nOr Republicans are hoping that this is not only stoke some fear for Republican voters but but drives him to the polls and you know yes there has been some violence in politics over the past Eighteen months ah you know we we remember the twenty Seventeen congressional baseball shooting that left\nSteve ... severely injured a Rand Paul's neighbor attacked him but those I think the difference there was those those acts of violence were not carried out by democratic activists\nFor the most part uh you know as far as we could tell all of the protests at the Kavanaugh hearings over the past couple of weeks though they're resulted in a hundreds of arrests um they were for the most part peaceful and uh and so I think that's important to point out\nIn the past Democrats had hoped that angry Tea Party rallies going back to two thousand ten or might a rally Democrats they hope that angry President Trump rallies with the chance of lock her up against Hillary Clinton now not Senator Dianne Feinstein would rally voters on the Democratic side in both cases that didn't pan out that way\nYeah I mean if you think back to to twenty ten Democrats were warning against the Tea Party a protesters that descended on\nThese democratic health care town halls and on Washington DC uh where where tens of thousands of turned out for these Tea Party protest\nDemocrats warn that a you know that this would be handing over power to to the angry mobs well in fact\n... was the year that the Tea Party wave washed over Washington and and handed the house of representatives to Republicans and so um you know it seems like there are a number of parallels between twenty ten and twenty a teen although the parties\nSort of have reverse themselves and and so it'll be interesting to see if if this is in fact sort of a mirror image for Democrats of the ... election\nGo back to our callers Robert is with us in Appleton Robert Hi\nYeah you need to make a distinction between the house the Senate races\nThe Democrats are because of a candidate selections a and a a variety of different demographics factors are very well positioned to take over the house the districts remember in the state you run for the whole or in the house districts\nThe Democrats have got a number of different states such as Pennsylvania with new districts uh New Jersey says they're going to take the house there's no question this is going to hurt the Democrats\nUh uh Missouri a mansion\nIs not going to help them solve with conservatives but it may very well\nOf loss um you know progressive a key thing is is but you still have Trump a month to you know the ... you know eight lies that has to make himself the center of the stories\nAnd I think by the time the election is Don it's gonna be a referendum on Trump\nRobert thanks a lot for the call a lot there Scott he's definitely right about the Senate versus house distinction Democrats defending a lot more seats in the Senate in places less favorable to them one possible outcome could be among many big wins for Democrats in the house not so great for Democrats in the Senate Scott\n[laughter] I mean I think that's the most likely option at this point there's tremendous energy obviously on the Democratic side uh you know following these Kavanaugh hearings where a lot of women voters felt alienated\nA felt very angry at the treatment of some of the Kavanaugh accusers and didn't like the process itself\nUh they're they're going to be turning up at the polls and word that's going to make the most impact is is in some of these suburban uh you know well educated affluent districts that are now controlled by Republicans\nI'm Bad blue wave could sweep over a lot of those districts and uh and flip the house of representatives\nObviously what the caller was talking about in in about the Senate was that a Democrats are defending a lot more seats are in the Senate and especially those in red states like Joe mansion in West Virginia and Claire McCaskill in Missouri and so if you have more engagement on the Republican side as a result of Kavanaugh\nThat's going to help Republicans or perhaps pick up one or two seats and and be able to preserve that Republican majority in the Senate\nThanks for the call time for one more caller before recover a couple of more issues marketing is with us in Milwaukee Marcus Hi\nHi I'm I'd gladly cut out for Donald Trump says he already told a life of the day um it's like a light of the story but Harvard issue um I Would say to answer your question uh\nThat traditionally I Would have said yes it does make a difference when you have a ... like the cabinet are hearing I'm going back to like Clarence Thomas a one party got a boost one party credit card to hear from it\nUm but nowadays with what's going on I'm just there I mean literally today we had the stock market drop over eight hundred party we had you know I'm a hurricane come ashore um\nWe have a a un representative resign units that three major thing and the human mind could only focus on three or four major things that you know like at any given time\nAnd most people have stuffing their personal life or like in the streets come in like machine gun fire and you're trying to like focusing on one or two votes slipping past I don't think that could happen\nMarcus thanks a lot for the call touching is kind of what we're talking about earlier where one story gets crowded out by the next story really quickly these days\n[laughter] well that's right and I think you know one other way to think about that is is that people are starting to receive their absentee ballots there early ballots\nAre and so if people know which way they're going to vote a you know ... they're going to be sending back those ballots based on today's news stories and and how they feel today\nA and so you know I think the undecided will perhaps hold on wait till election day to vote but are there are votes being cast each day as we marched to November sixth\nWant to touch on a couple of more stories before we're done Scott Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general a couple of weeks ago we all heard that he was resigning with being fired and that he was ...\nNow he's still in the job meeting with President Trump and says to me with some Republicans in the house so what's going on with that\nWell he was supposed to appear before a house Republicans a earlier today that meeting was postponed but a earlier this week Rosenstein flew to Florida on air force one with President Trump he appeared again at the White House today at a bill signing with the president\nUh for legislation on on a pharmaceuticals a you know I think this is an attempt for to Trump for Trump to sort of bring Rosenstein a little bit closer it's sort of bad philosophy of\nOf you know keep your friends close and your enemies close or a you know perhaps presidents trying to get inside the mind of of Rosenstein is this\nA Mueller investigation is is proceeding\nOr it's not entirely clear but for now Rosenstein is job appears safe and and Rosenstein does have some protection from the Republican leadership and in Congress and Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan said they have\nFull faith and trust in in Rosenstein remaining in his position if some of the other conservative agitator that are trying to\nUh get Rosenstein fired and are in and remove him from office\nAnd then a Kevin McCarthy one of those House Republican leaders announced yesterday is bringing out an immigration bill among other things would fully fund a wall on the U.S Mexico border give us the cliff notes on this bill Scott\n[noise] yeah shirt twenty three point four billion dollars for Trump's border wall of course the Congress already punted the fight\nOver funding until after the midterm elections and so the next time the government will need to be funded will be in September I'm Sorry in December\nBut what this means is that uh this issue of the border wall and immigration will be litigated on the campaign trail there it's just that they don't need to make any decisions until the lame duck session after the election but\nObviously a immigration always a hot button issue and it will continue to be a in the lame duck session\nAnd there's a good chance no matter what happened in the elections the current Congress might decide this issue not twenty Nineteen Congress\n[noise] yeah I mean immigration is is probably not going to get resolved or you know anytime soon and so it'll it'll all depend on what happens in November in which parties are controlling the house in the Senate\nScott thanks as always for joining us okay thanks for having me\nThat Scott Long senior staff writer for the hill where he covers House Republicans among other things he was with us for our weekly look at the big stories in national politics\nComing up after the news will talk about the August flooding in Dane County and much of Wisconsin what makes the area so vulnerable and how we can learn lessons from flooding in any community and apply them to prevention in the future I'm Rob fair and you're listening to central time here on the ideas network [noise]\nAnd um when you look at it from that perspective the storm that we had here on August twenty and if it was actually only about the fourth largest and in fact the storms that occurred farther west or in the western part of the states\nI'm about a week later we're we're even a little bit larger than what we had here\nTalk about what a city like Madison and there are other comedians that can do a similar thing can do with this kind of information yeah I think it's really useful for adding some context\nUm for what comes next and and so I'm within Madison and frankly in communities around the country there are a lot of conversations taking place now about what needs to be done to improve our infrastructure\nUh to stand up against events like this or even perhaps even larger events and so\nUm what we can do is say well how likely is\nAn event like the the storm and flooding that we had in August here in Madison and so ... the piece of software that I've developed and that my research group is continuing to to\nPush forward on um gives us an estimate that says that a storm just like the one that we saw here on August twentieth\nUm could occur on average once every Fifteen Years or so in this area um now there's some there's some wiggle room on either side of that because of course of the weather and climate is is somewhat uncertain but but that um estimate of about once every Fifteen Years I think is is I'm\nA pretty good a best guess and um and so what that means is that's you know not a not something that is never going to happen again in our lifetimes and so when we think about on\nGoing forward improving our stormwater management infrastructure improving the management of our lakes\nAnd I'm improving our stormwater ordinances\nOr when for example developers want to do some sort of new construction how they have to manage the runoff from that are from that site um that sort of contacts can help to frame those sorts of uh discussions\nTo Daniel right from the EU W Madison department of civil and environmental engineering I bought a piece he wrote on west contacts about\nFlooding focusing on Madison lessons for communities around the state I think one of them want to get into a couple of points of confusion offer the public we hear often thrown around phrases after a big weather like oh this was a\nHundred year storm or a thousand year whether it's ... or something like that which should not if I had this correctly make us think like oh well we got that out of the way we've got another thousand years to the next\nAbsolutely correct so I'm so old that hundred year storm terminology means is that it's it's a storm that you would expect to happen on average once\nEvery one hundred years but anyone who's been to Las Vegas and played the odds on any sort of card game or anything else knows that just because the probability works one way mean doesn't mean that reality is going to turn out\nUh in exactly the way that you think and so um what that means is that you can have multiple\nA hundred years storms or a hundred years slides over you know relatively short periods of time and on top of all of that we have the issue of a warming climate it's er which\nAre basically adds more ah humidity to the atmosphere which makes um these storms are more frequent and when they do occur larger and so\nI'm both in the upper Midwest in other parts of the country um they're very clear indications in our uh rainfall records that are extreme rainfall events particularly in the summertime are the types of events that we saw here\nUm and throughout Wisconsin and August are becoming more and more frequent\nTo take you back to Vegas that sounds like climate change is loading the dice a little bit it doesn't mean we're gonna have to fly to every single year it doesn't mean we could go we can't go five ten years without a flood but the odds of the flooding and given your higher that's absolutely right and and to um rely only on\nOur experiences from the past to make decisions are going forward about how we're\nGoing to respond to these sorts of changes in my opinion is a big mistake and we need to um turn to you know cutting edge climate science and I'm advances and and um my field of of hydrologist water resources engineering as well\nYou mentioned storm runoff earlier and that reading your piece it seems like at a very different event if that's at eight inches fell in a forest in farmland or on a concrete and I got very a city with limited uh absorption capacity I guess\nYeah that's that's absolutely right so you you know it it's clear that uh if you have over an area\nUm that area is no longer they're able to soak up heavy rainfall and so in the case of Madison or you know before uh before the city of Madison or was built up this was all our wetlands\nAnd so now when you have heavy rain storms that water has to go somewhere and so\nUm it's not able to soak into the soil is it's not um you know filling up what used to be a wetland areas and so it has to go into the lakes and the lake levels rise or in some cases they can and and this is what we had here I'm In Madison and August the lake levels can rise so high that\nThe storm water sewers which all are supposed to drain into the lakes are no longer able to move water the way they're supposed to because there's nowhere for that water to go\nIs there a a civic engineering solution to that I've heard of things like ... a permeable surfaces concrete asphalt I Can't remember what is that one possible solution well I think the the right approach here is to look at all of a\nSolutions because I think I'm particularly in the case of Madison it's actually the case where there's not going to be one solution and there's not one magic bullet to this problem you know we've we've built up the area so much that I'm I'm\nThat we've sort of backed ourselves into a bit of a corner things like a permeable pavements\nRoofs these are all I'm so called green infrastructure options that can or perhaps move the needle a little bit um but on the other hand uh\nI think that ultimately some bigger picture solutions are going to be necessary as well so stricter stormwater management ordinances\nWe already have some of the strongest ordinances and the state but there's I'm fairly strong evidence that the ordinance is even need to be a little bit stronger still to make sure that we're not making this problem worse in the future\nAnd then also a summary evaluation\nOf how we manage the chain of lakes here so I'm lake mendota for example or is that the level in that way 'cause able to be controlled by attorney dam\nAnd so if the lake level had been lower prior to the August twentieth storm or the impacts would have been um\nLess severe than they actually were as we wrap up let's go back to the wakeup call idea are you hoping that leaders both in Madison in any community that might experience floods will take this year's lessons and start trying to solve them now for next time\nA that's certainly my hope yes we'll leave it there thanks so much for joining us yeah thank you\nDaniel right of the department of civil and environmental engineering at U.

Rob\nSumming up Wisconsin hospital's saw more than one billion dollars in unpaid medical bills last\nYear a fourteen percent increase from the year before we'll find out why more care is going unpaid for and how the cops get passed on first election day is getting closer with just under a month before voters head to the polls the Marquette University law school poll has been tracking the statewide races in this year's midterm elections\nResults from their latest survey are out today\nCharles Franklin is the bulls director and the founder of bolstered dot com Charles welcome back to the show\nOr good to be here let's dive into some of the big ticket races Charles that people are watching for and start with the race for governor what uh what did you see what's been changing\n... this month we have a toss up forty six percent for ... forty seven for Walker a that's obviously well within the margin of error we had at one point margin\nOr a month ago or three weeks ago in September ... led forty nine to forty four so the shift is a down\nThree points for Evers up three points for Walker um in our August ... we had the race a dead by so I'd say over these three polls we've seen some hints that ... might have an advantage last month\nBut we're back to a clear a toss up this month so I'm the upshot I think is that this looks like a very competitive race\nOther polling of the race has shown large ... advantages of as much as seven recently but also as little as two so there's been a range of polling in the race but I think a toss up is about where the race looks right now\nNow when you are to eating out the bull resolves I'm watching for those and I'm also watching for the first people to say you over sampled ... members of one party or the other and that explains the results can you talk about how you a sample by party and how that fits into the the final product\nWell almost all polling that uses legitimate random sampling um draws the sample as well as we can but doesn't declare ahead of time what the party balance will be and that's certainly true of my polling\nSo the party split that we get is a result of what people tell us and the particular survey\nNot something that I get to make up what I think the party balance in the state would be and so it is what it is the movement of from last time to this time is a movement from\nA a democratic

coal production of Wisconsin Public radio and Wisconsin Public television in partnership with the Wisconsin humanities council additional support comes from law and Mary Peterson of Appleton find more Wisconsin life at Wisconsin my diet Oregon and on Facebook and wearing a column\nNow a report for most cops are in the hospital association found that last year unpaid medical bills in hospitals around the state rose to total of one point one billion dollars that reverses the downward trend of the past ... years healthcare advocates reporting to recent changes on the federal and state level as possible reasons for this shift\nShe knows is a reporter for Wisconsin Public radio news she's been covering this issue should mean welcome back to central time thanks Rob let's start off with where this uh this debt so does on these unpaid bills come from what are the sources about in hospitals well\nMainly it's two areas it's bad debt and charity care or you can think of it as people who can't pay they can't afford to pay and people who\nDon't pay and it's not necessarily um I don't want to pay this bill it may be a problem with medical coding there's a lot of administrative and bureaucratic\nProcess sees in getting these bills out and paid so I mean if you think of it is campaign and don't pay that's uncompensated care\nAnd this is fun at hospitals have to keep track of and record on correct\nRight every year they have to do a report\nVery detailed report that talks about charity care and bad debt and the reason Congress makes them do this is hospitals get a very substantial tax break\nAnd the reason they get the tax break is ... because they provide this charity care so they have to prove that they are indeed providing charity care\nTalk about the arc of this unpaid medical issue and hospitals over the last ... years\nWell it's saw its lowest point in twenty Fifteen and this was\nTo expand insurance for a number of people to ways by expanding Medicaid and then also\nBy providing insurance reforms or more people could get insurance without being denied so basically you get a lot of even millions of people covered across the nation and so hospitals some more bills paid people were able to afford to pay them\n... one hypothetical case might be someone goes into get medical care gets built for it it turns out that didn't have insurance or the insurance doesn't cover that issue a and they can't pay the hospital and look holding the bag\nRight right there were fewer instances under the AC where insurance companies could deny claims so you had more of those claims paid\nAnd we have the latest data and that's the subject of your your new reporting on this this is up to twenty Seventeen is that right correct what are we see last year\nOver a billion dollars one point one million dollars so it's a lot of money and what's interesting\nIs one point one billion Justin Wisconsin\nRight right that's a good point to make 'em across the nation it's thirty eight billion so I mean it's a lot of money we're talking about\nThe hospitals aren't getting money for the medical services they provide and in Wisconsin it hasn't reached this level\nFor since twenty fourteen and that as I said earlier was when the ... started now that's not the entire reason you can't\nSay that's the only reason we're seeing medical debt rise or fall there is also prices medical costs are going up um we're told the economy is faring better but wages have been stagnant\nAnd do we know how this is distributed around the state\nWhere the brunt of it the Milwaukee County I'm thirty percent of all uncompensated care as Milwaukee County now of course it's the most populous county but it's not thirty percent of the state right right exactly [laughter]\nYeah so it's a disproportionate amount in the biggest and it makes sense it's in many ways the highest population of low income people and Mr exactly so you have a double whammy are there efforts in the works to to try to deal with this problem and and try to bring down this unpaid medical data hospitals\nWell there are a number of things I'm One of them of course was getting more people insurance um Governor Walker is also try to lower premiums we've seen a spike in premiums under the Affordable CARE Act and through something known as reinsurance\nWhich is a fancy way of saying basically the federal government and state is subsidizing seventies high costs medical claims\nBut that is only going to a ... effect a portion of the market is not going to affect a widespread swath people\nWhat impact does this unpaid medical that have on hospitals and the care they provide a billion one point one million dollars doesn't just magically disappear\n[noise] well like everything else they pass it along to you and I ... I mean it's a business and they have to recoup these costs so people they do have insurance are seeing a little boost in their bails\nYou've been reporting on this issue over the years or something you get the sense of for politicians and health care providers to someone they see as an urgent hot button issue or is this is this just some of it's kind of a a steady drumbeat there's always going to be some data out there\nWe've seen debt higher than this in previous years and there wasn't really action to deal with it so now it may come to a head just because health care is such a big issue in this election however UC pre existing condition\nAll bad debt and the business side of things is less self however medical bill unpaid medical bills could crop up again\nSamantha thanks for signing some light on this for us thanks rap\nSomebody knows is a reporter for WPRI news she joined us to talk about the rise an unpaid medical costs in Wisconsin that top a billion dollars in twenty Seventeen\nA little bit more likely to say consider themselves a leader and all all of those positive things\nUm in terms of you know one of the most surprising things to me in these data is just the degree to which girls and boys are in an environment just immersed in ... in sort of ah the sexual ... and and objective vacation of\nGirls and women um\nBut yeah as Claire said so boys get the message that I'm the most important trait in Boise is strengthen toughness girls it's being a physically attractive half of girls look in the mirror at least once a day and imagine how others might see them that's compared to thirty one percent hum\nOf boys in I was speaking to this environment the sort of sexual as environment two thirds of girls said they're exposed several times more or more to women and girls in the media who have unrealistic bodies half say that several times a week or more they see female characters in t._v. or movies whose bodies and looks are more important than their abilities\nOf girls say they hear boys making sexual comments or sexual jokes about girls at least several times a week and when you look at teen girls for fourteen took to Nineteen year olds forty seven percent almost half a teen girls say they hear boys making a sexual comes or sexual jokes about girls everyday\nAnd even one in four younger girls here's the here's these comments everyday and ... and boys pretty much stay the same thing they say um [noise]\nYou know they're likely to hear these comments or in Hollywood or they're like here males a ... characters and TV in Hollywood making sexual comes and jokes about women half of boys ages fourteen and Nineteen have heard male family members make sexual jokes or sexual comments about women and\nAnd hearing the especially hearing those comments sexual jokes and sexual comments about women is correlated with a lot of\nUh a lot of surprising things in the in the survey too and and sort of a um other types of pressure around um you know hiding your feelings and uh\nHaving less egalitarian views toward women and and more likely to be feel it's OK to ask a girl for naked or sexy pictures so yeah we have a lot of findings are around just sort of just the climate uh around\nA women girls and and you know sexual ... and an object of vacation\nAnd you also spent time interviewing several sixth grade students with the lower end of this huge range surveys and you talk to them about their experience with gender what kind of a response ... did you hear how to be matched up with your survey results [noise]\nThey were actually in eighth grade um but I'm very close to that age and they are really reflected what a survey showed so at this middle school that I went to there are a couple of girls on the football team girls made up the vast majority of the student council members\nThey said they wanted to be you know scientists when they grow up and lawyers when they grow up they said math and science for their favorite subject they said they really felt that they were equal in school and in their lives to boy that people treated them that way\nUm until that confidence was on display at the same time they said that despite all that\nThey felt that what society value most in them\nWith their looks and the you know they felt either that they were hearing from their parents um you know it's important to grow up to be a Good Wife or they were hearing you know from the media that\nI'm being physically attractive was the most important thing or they were hearing from boys who you know\nAsk them for sexy pictures on a regular basis by tech methods things like this um where they were they were really getting on those those double messages that the data found and then the boys I interviewed on it was slightly heartbreaking because\nThey you know talked about some of them talked about how they played sports and they thought you know being tough was they also had a disconnect where they said the most important to them\nWas to be confident and ambitious that they thought that what society value more in them was to be tough and strong and\nSome of them played sports and said they didn't feel comfortable expressing their emotions except when they were playing sports and then they felt like they you know could give themselves the freedom to get fired up as one said others who didn't play sports said that they felt a lot of pressure to do so at one said that he didn't feel like he was a real man because\nHe he wasn't physically strong and he didn't do activities like that he had started a coating club at school and wanted to be a computer scientist um and and was really feeling the pressure that this was not the traditional expectation one said that he had wanted to play volleyball and I'm a parent\nBeen made fun of for that and so you know what the survey found what other research has found and what these boys described to me is that there's much less flexibility for boy there is um there are a much narrower roles that expected at the end and going outside\nOf those roles at all on you get a lot of feedback that that's the wrong thing to do in a way that girls roles have really expand that much more\nStarted a cleric Cain Miller correspondence from New York Times and trust that under the lead researcher from Perry undone who led a study of the views and

C. uh where where tens of thousands or turned out for these Tea Party protest Democrats warn that a you know that this would be handing over power to to the angry mobs well in fact\n... was the year that the Tea Party wave washed over Washington and handed the house of representatives to Republicans and so um you know it seems like there are a number of parallels between twenty and ten and twenty a teen although the parties\nSort of have reversed themselves and and so it will be interesting to see if if this is in fact sort of a mirror image for Democrats of the ... election\nGo back to our callers Robert is with us in Appleton Robert Hi\nYeah you need to make a distinction between the house and the Senate races the Democrats are because of a candidate elections a and a variety of different demographics factors are very well positioned to take over the house\nThe districts remember in the state you run for the whole the\nIn the house districts the Democrats have got a number of different states such as Pennsylvania with new districts uh New Jersey ... they're going to take the house there's no question this is going to hurt the Democrats and places like North Dakota\nI'm Missouri a mansion is not going to help them solve with conservatives but it may very well have lost um you know progressive of the key thing is is are\nYou still have Trump a month to you know be in our society is that how you know eight lies that make himself the center of this for it\nAnd I think by the time the election is Don it's gonna be a referendum on Trump\nRobert thanks a lot for the call a lot there Scott he's definitely right about the Senate versus house distinction Democrats defending a lot more seats in the Senate in places less favorable to them one possible outcome could be among many big wins for Democrats in the house not so great for Democrats in the Senate\nSupport for WPRI comes from people's food co ops thinking all shoppers for patients during the storm wide remodeling a vials and shelving as well as access to Delhi in bakery departments updates Iraq PFC ...\nAngry at the treatment of some of the Kavanaugh accusers and didn't like the process itself ah they're they're going to be turning up at the polls and where that's going to make the most impact is is in some of these\nSuburban uh you know well educated affluent districts that are now controlled by Republicans\nI'm Bad blue wave could sweep over a lot of those districts and uh and flip the house of representatives obviously what the caller was talking about in in about the Senate was that\nA Democrats are defending a lot more seats are in the Senate and especially those in red states like Joe mansion in West Virginia and Claire McCaskill in Missouri and so if you have more engagement on the Republican side as a result of Kavanaugh\nThat's going to help Republicans or perhaps pick up one or two seats and and be able to preserve that Republican majority in the Senate\nMakes the call time for one more caller before recover a couple of more issues market is with us in Milwaukee Marcus Hi\nHi I'm I'd gladly cut out for a Donald Trump has already called eight live day um it's like a light of the story but Harvard issue um I Would say to answer your question uh that\nTraditionally I Would have said yes it does make a difference when you have a country like the cabinet are carrying\nI'm going back like Clarence Thomas a one party got a boost one party credit card to hear from it um but nowadays with what's going on um winter there I mean literally today we had the stock market drop over eight hundred party we had you know I'm a hurricane come ashore\nUm we have a a un representative resign\nPrice that's three major thing and they didn't mind could only focus on three or four major thing that ...\nYou know like at any given time and most people have stuffing their personal life or it's like when you started coming like machine gun fire and you're trying to like focusing on one or two votes slipping past I don't think that could happen\nMarcus thanks a lot for the call touching is kind of all we're talking about earlier where one story gets crowded out by the next story really quickly these days\n[laughter] well that's right and I think you know one other way to think about that is is that people are starting to receive their absentee ballots there early ballots\nAre and so if people know which way they're going to vote a you know ... they're going to be sending back those ballots based on today's news stories and and how they feel today\nA and so you know I think the undecided will perhaps hold on wait till election day to vote but are there are votes being cast each day as we marched to November sixth\nWant to touch on a couple of more stories before we're done Scott Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general a couple of weeks ago we all heard that he was resigning with being fired and that he was refusing to resign so that Trump would have to fire him now he's still in the job meeting with President Trump and says to me with some Republicans in the house so what's going on with that\nWell he he was supposed to appear before a house Republicans a earlier today that meeting was postponed but a earlier this week Rosenstein flew to Florida on air force one with President Trump he appeared again at the White House today at a bill signing with the president\nUh for legislation on on a pharmaceuticals\nA you know I think this is an attempt for to Trump for Trump to sort of bring Rosenstein a little bit closer it's sort of bad philosophy of of you know keep your friends close and your enemies close or a you know perhaps the president's trying to get inside the mind of of Rosenstein is this a mall or investigate\nUh it's not entirely clear but for now Rosenstein is job appears safe and and Rosenstein does have some protection from the Republican leadership and in Congress and Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan said they have\nFull faith and trust in in Rosenstein remaining in his position if some of the other conservative agitator that are trying to uh get Rosenstein fired and are in and remove him from office\nAnd then a Kevin McCarthy one of those House Republican leaders announced yesterday is bringing out an immigration bill among other things would fully fund a wall on the U.S Mexico border give us the cliff notes on this bill Scott\n[laughter] yeah shirt twenty three point four billion dollars for Trump's border wall of course\nThe Congress already punted the fight\nOver funding until after the midterm elections and so the next time the government will need to be funded will be in September I'm Sorry in December but what this means is that uh this issue of the border wall and immigration will be litigated on the campaign trail but it's just that they don't need to make any decisions until\nThe lame duck session after the election but obviously a immigration always a hot button issue in it will continue to be a in the lame duck session\nAnd there's a good chance no matter what happened in the elections the current Congress might decide this issue not twenty Nineteen Congress\n[noise] yeah I mean immigration is is probably not going to get resolved ah you know anytime soon and so it'll it'll all depend on what happens in November in which parties are controlling the house in the Senate\nScott thanks as always for joining us\nOkay thanks for having me\nThat Scott Long senior staff writer for the hill where he covers House Republicans among other things he was with us for our weekly look at the big stories in national politics\nComing up after the news will talk about the August flooding in Dane County and much of Wisconsin what makes the area so vulnerable and how we can learn lessons from flooding in any community and apply them to prevention in the future I'm Rob fair and you're listening to central time here on the idea of network [noise]\nAnd um when you look at it from that perspective the storm that we had here on August twenty I was actually only about the fourth largest and in fact the storms that occurred farther west\nOr in the western part of the states I'm about a week later where we're even a little bit larger than what we had here\nTalk about what a city like Madison and there are other communities that can do a similar thing can do with this kind of information [noise] yeah I think it's really useful for adding some context um for what\nComes next and and so I'm within Madison and frankly in communities around the country there are a lot of conversation is taking place now about what needs to be done to improve our infrastructure uh to stand up against events like this or even perhaps even larger events and so um\nWhat we can do is say well how likely is an event like the the storm and flooding that we had in August here in Madison and so ... the piece of software that I've developed and that my research group is continuing to to push forward on um gives us\nAn estimate that says that a storm just like the one that we saw here on August twentieth um could occur on average once every Fifteen Years or so\nIn this area um now there's some there's some wiggle room on either side of that because of course of the weather and climate is is somewhat uncertain but but that um estimate of about once every Fifteen Years I think is is I'm\nA pretty good a best guess and um and so what that means is that's you know not a not something that\nIs never going to happen again in our lifetimes and so when we think about I'm going forward improving our stormwater management infrastructure improving the management of our lakes\nAnd I'm improving our stormwater ordinances or when for example developers want to do some sort of new construction how they have to manage the runoff from that are\nFrom that site um that sort of contacts can help to frame those sorts of discussions\nTalking to Daniel right from the EU W Madison department of civil and environmental engineering I bought a piece he wrote on west contacts about\nFlooding focusing on Madison lessons for communities around the state I think one of them want to get into a couple of points of confusion offer the public we hear often thrown around phrases after big while they're like oh this was a\nHundred year storm or a thousand year whether that or something like that which should not if I had this currently make us think like oh well we got that out of the way we've got another thousand years to the next one that is not how it works yes that's absolutely correct so I'm\nSo old that hundred year storm\nTerminology means is that it's it's a storm that you would expect to happen on average once every one hundred years but anyone who's been to Las Vegas and played the odds\nOn any sort of card game or anything else knows that just because the probability works one way I mean doesn't mean that reality is going to turn out uh in exactly the way to achieve saying can so um what that means is that you can have multiple\nA hundred years storms or a hundred year ... over you know relatively short periods of time and on top of all of that we have the issue of a warming climate or which are basically adds more\nWhich makes um these storms are more frequent and when they do occur larger and so\nI'm both in the upper Midwest in other parts of the country um they're very clear indications in our uh rainfall records that are extreme rainfall events particularly in the summertime are the types of events that we saw here\nUm and throughout Wisconsin and August are becoming more and more frequent\nTo take you back to Vegas that sounds like climate change is loading the dice a little bit it doesn't mean we're going to happen to fly to every single year it doesn't mean we could go we can't go five ten years without a flood but the odds of a flood any given your higher that's absolutely right and and to um rely only on our experiences\nFrom the past to make decisions are going forward about how we're going to respond to these sorts of changes in my opinion is a big mistake and we need to um turn to you know cutting edge climate science and I'm advances and\nAnd um my field of of hydraulic gee in water resources engineer and as well\nYou mentioned storm runoff earlier and that reading your piece it seems like a a very different event if that's\nAt eight inches fell in a forest in farmland or on a concrete and I got very a city with limited uh absorption capacity I guess\nYeah that's that's absolutely right so you know it it's clear that uh\nIf you have over an area um that areas no longer they're able to soak up heavy rainfall and so in the case of Madison or you know before uh before the city of Madison or was built up this was all a wetland and so now\nWhen you have heavy rain storms that water has to go somewhere and so um it's not able to soak into the soil as it's not um you know filling up what used to be a wetland areas and so it has to go into the lakes and lake levels rise or in some cases they can and and this is what we had here\nI'm In Madison and August the lake levels can rise so high that the storm water sewers which all are supposed to drain into the lakes\nAre no longer able to move the water the way they're supposed to because there's nowhere for that water to go\nIs there a a civic engineering solution to that I've heard of things like ... a permeable surfaces cocker asphalt I Can't remember what I is that one possible solution well I think the the right approach here is to look at all of the possible solutions because I think\nI'm particularly in the case of Madison it's actually the case where there's not going to be one solution\nThere's not one magic bullet to this problem you know we've we've built up the area so much that\nI'm I'm that\nWe've sort of backed ourselves into a bit of a corner and\nThings like a permeable pavements rain gardens rain barrels green roofs these are all I'm so called green infrastructure options that can or perhaps move the needle a little bit\nUm but on the other hand uh I think that ultimately some bigger picture solutions are going to be necessary\nAs well so stricter\nStorm water management ordinances we already have some of the strongest ordinances and the state but there's I'm fairly strong evidence that the ordinance is even need to be a little bit stronger still to make sure that we're not making this problem worse in the future\nAnd then also a summary evaluation of how we manage the chain of lakes here so I'm lake mendota for example\nOr is that the level and that like\nDam and so if the lake level had been lower prior to the August twentieth storm or the impacts would have been\nUm less severe than they actually were as we wrap up let's go back to a wakeup call idea are you hoping that leaders both in Madison and in any community that might experience floods will take this year's lessons and start trying to solve them now for next time a that's certainly my hope yes\nWe'll leave it there thanks so much for joining us yeah thank you Daniel right of the department\nOf civil and environmental engineering at U. W. Madison you can read his piece about the increase the likelihood of storms like we had an August on line with contacts the dot org\nAnd tomorrow after four thirty we'll get an update on the courage flooding and weather situation around the state and we'll ask for your personal stories about flooding this year and how you maybe your property your community are recovering\nComing up we all feel lonely from time to time whether it'd be when the kids move out of the house or you find yourself in a new city well here from a writer and illustrator about her new project on American loneliness that's coming up on central time\nI'm Robert Kennedy and I'm representing energies we've had a matching gifts program in place for many years we match\nGifts to these organizations between twenty five dollars up to twenty thousand dollars in a calendar year it's a great way to engage our employees they have a say in what we're doing with our charitable giving to make it a better company [noise] I'm Robert Kennedy and we introduce foundation matches our employees donations to WPRI\nTo see if your company will match your donation go to W.
