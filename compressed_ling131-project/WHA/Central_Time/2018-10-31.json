we talked a researcher about why we're seeing more school referendum coming up\nFirst are less than a week away from the mid term elections and there are some interesting and important congressional races to watch across the country and immigration has been big news this week with more than five thousand active duty us troops being sent to the U.S border and with President Trump claiming he could end birthright citizenship by executive order\nOr question for you this week is do you think that the president is rights to want to remove the constitutional right to be a US citizen if you were born on us soil why or why not what do you think of the timing and bring this issue up or right before the midterm elections call eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred\nEmail ideas that WPRI dot org Fernando ... is the Washington reporter for one of his own Fernando welcome to central time\nRob yes thank you I Love central time I used to live in Iowa so I'm used to central time\nWonderful I don't know just like for you than when you're talking about that but not at all well before we get into specifics of the the troops to the border and his birthright citizenship thing let's talk about the timing and the politics you know President Trump wants people talking and thinking about immigration issues it looks like has become a new election day right\nOh absolutely the the timing for the president in a way is a is perfect um there's been much talk about what a cause this this migrant a care of and that the that started\nA few weeks ago on let me tell you or give you some context here uh this caravan began I in Honduras the first the three now because now there are three uh three different groups um everybody tend to agree that they began sort of by contacts and social media they were kind of spurred by\nSome leftists leftist activists in Honduras trying to make their their government look bad\nOr their current president\nA president Hernandez is not very popular so anyway these people seem to have organized via social media and decided that this was a cheap way to go all together and not paying ... or or traffickers to bring 'em up here and paying enormous fees\nHowever this this care even began the day after the U.S\nAnd Mexico hosted at the department of state the presidents of Honduras Guatemala and the VP of El Salvador in which that we're gonna talk exactly about this and this this caravan begins the day after these meetings and here after vice president and vice president Pence\nSecretary da ... secretary Nielsen secretary of state Mike Pompeo they tell them to the messages look tell your people not to come here legally anyway so now we're getting to this point of this as we all know that this\nCaravan is getting closer there still about nine hundred miles that is the one that's closest to the U.S border and the president tells a the Pentagon\nTo maybe try and get this idea out there see how it feels right now in the middle of an election season\nAnd um and throw out this executive order which is going to be immediately challenged in the legal courts and see how far it goes\nRight now they have the conservative Supreme Court and they're just basically testing the waters to see a or they would if they actually do this even though the White House did tell us yesterday there were no immediate plans were to decide this executive order but let's say it happens they may be trying to test the waters to see how far they can go in the courts\n... called ... in Milwaukee you hello\nAm I Am curling as from my accent that I Am off mic and my dad's\nA political or make it a chance to discuss the case in Portugal\nThat go with my daughter at a very nice talking with no other lady was holding a baby and her

I Believe\nIn and got married so they have that and it had become an American citizen can stick it fits Eddie consider yourself an American citizen\nSo to a family you may\nNeed is we don't have too much time a Fernando that's a concern that critics birthright citizenship by habits people game the system and get a they have a kid here in the United states and that's a that's that's the way into the country I guess the current concern that's often right\nWell that is ah the the main concern behind the the what what Republicans and particularly this president has called chain migration which is basically he wants to and many Republicans have in the past the again that's not a lot of these are new ideas and wanted to change the system to a more\nOf what they call a merit based system to bring in more people that have higher levels of education\nAh and it is true that many people who bring in um new bringing their relatives bed as any immigrant that has gone to the system knows and many Americans have not obviously um they it is very hard to bring it up quickly\nOr any relatives that it's not an immediate relative and I mean by I mean parents a\nSpouse and children anybody else in particular even adult children it's hard to bring and take some time however the the whole issue of bringing\nA and people by merit as as it's been suggested in the past was tried to ... and they try to include it in some of the uh pass legislative efforts in Congress and as you know all of them have eventually failed\nBut uh it's it's not a new idea but the main problem is again for people who have a very low skills like the migrants are coming up up up from Honduras there's very little way for them\nThe administration and say well go back and try to apply legally there's almost no way for such a low skilled worker to come in they're only very few visas that tend to be very temporary and for very specific jobs like in the hospitality industry or agricultural industry\nWhich are those are you know meant to be temporary in nature and general\nThanks to your calls I promised Fernando we talk a little bit about mid term elections we just have a minute or so left where are you watching most closely right now\n[noise] well I think there are so many to talk right now but we were basically the autumn line as we know the Democrats need to flip twenty three seats\nA Seventeen how by GOP tend to be\nVery ... a very um a competitive right now that the Democrats have identified between a hundred and Seventy three competitive races where they need to flip the house I'm there about fifty six Republican vulnerable seats as well and red states particularly get in the suburbs that they are hoping to win\nRight now according to many of the first time the polls which of course was learned maybe not to believe that until we get some surprises at the end that there is a higher chance of the Democrats to take over the\nTo take over the house on the Senate side of the harder there are many races that will watching like the one to replace Jeff Flake or in Arizona or the one that a U.S Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia face is a really hard call then is Texas Beto O'Rourke against Ted Cruz I'm not so far from you in the house\nWe have the Iowa first district Abby Finkenauer\nAre facing the incumbent Republican rod Blum is one of the hot a\nHot districts of course let's not forget the open seat for Paul Ryan but um I think right now the way things are look a I'm a house leader below sea\nUh said very confidently just a few hours ago uh that she thinks that that that the Democrats I Want to go on to win the house but that the polls seem to seats to show the things that tightening a lot and it's going to be a very close called\nFernando thanks for joining us today my pleasure rental cars are all the lawsuits reporter for one of his own he joined us for a week we look at some of the top stories in national news [noise]\nNow it's time for Wisconsin migrants producers you've got your\n\nYou might imagine that a winter weekend trip to visit the ice cubes on the lake superior shore would be an adventure of fun and discovery but one never knows what darkness lurks around the next bend me into well shares this two at a life story telling a bit presented by ... in Milwaukee\nThere are some people who really love the outdoors right\nI Am not that person I grew up in cities person Chicago and Milwaukee I grew up watching horror movies black people don't do so well in those movies right when I\nThink cabin in the woods I think ... gonna common like murder you especially if you've had\nRight or like they're delivering style hillbillies around the end of a river and then as I started to get older I started to challenge those years but that doesn't mean that I'm not\nScared it doesn't mean that right I fill in the back of my head I think that there's probably something out there trying to get me but I'm just you know it's worth it it's it's worth that risk so like four years ago someone posted these pictures on the ice caves at the past\nThey were beautiful and they were gorgeous and it was all this like frozen ice and there's people with like ... bonds and they're like you know to the ice and I was like I Am going to be that person\nSo as soon as they said like the ice is thick enough to go up out onto the ice along the lake shore and go into these caves I start planning my trip I got a bunch of friends together\nThan those friends invited other friends and it turned out we had eight people\nAnd I didn't know everybody but I was like they're friends of friends were all going to get together we're going to look at some ice we're going to hang out what bad thing could happen on this trip\nSo Saturday morning we wake up really early we'd go see the ice caves we spend the whole day looking at frozen water right we're just we're in it were taking selfies with life it is due to fall for either I allow tights there's ice formations or were crawling on\nThe ice and we got you know we're we're out there are thousands of people right come out to see some life and so at like five pm that night we're cold and wet and Hungary and kind of cranky and we have to find our cabin\nAnd because there's thousands of people who have traveled to find this ice accommodations are scarce\nSo we ended up at this cabin it's like outside of a small town\nAnd it's down in a secluded road\nAnd it's up a long and winding personal driveway\nAnd the the neighbors are miles away and we get there and it's a really nice cabin you know it's got four bedrooms it's really big it's beautiful\nWere drinking and getting to know each other we're playing games and laugh and it turns into like a dance party that goes to all three am or like rocking out in this cabin\nThen we go to bed and the sun is kind of coming up and it's really quiet in the cabin and they wake up and I have to be I get up and go to ... and I'm a little bleary eyed guy\nYou know and I go to the bathroom and I come out of the bathroom and I'm like you know I think I maybe should get a drink of water on the wall between the bathroom in the kitchen is a bloody hand prints\nWhen I was\nJust a dream or a more sinister turtles ... to find out joined us friday morning for the conclusion of the bloody in print the story from ... in Milwaukee\nAnd that's part of the story and you've been on with us to talk about this before a lot of those rural districts where you're again and again they're seen declining populations in their community and a smaller numbers of students can you talk about how that affects their finances\nSo their their numbers are declining and many districts and so that means they get less revenue from the state\nBecause the states as a part of the fighting is per student at your school\nWrecked correct so every it's a three year average but they they take those numbers and say okay this is how many students who have said this is how much are the are the the formula allows you to have a based on your enrollment\nAnd the uh expensive don't necessarily strength along with that right you can't drink your school size are you still need the buses to run the same route there are a lot of fix expenses that don't go down even as a number of students go down\nCorrect so that and so when you look at the numbers and you see that I'm both revenue per student and cost per student those those numbers are higher in a rural district for that very reason\nAs soon as this part of what a big part of what's driving a lot of these rural districts to go and ask these operational referendum to to help make ends meet\nI I Believe so I Believe that that is what's what is happening in those districts is is to make ends meet their more frequently going to referendum\nHow much of this was affected by the directs the commitment or to schools and and are there solutions from the state level we've heard about what is it the scarcity or in the targeting though these rural districts were talking about\nIs so what what has happened over the last several years is I'm In instead of look there's there's been much discussion about the revenue limit and how to fix the funding formula\nBut there has been um um small fix is like the star city aid which we call categorical a funding that that is based specifically for a certain types of districts\nWe are talking to Sarah Campbell with the school enrollment projections program after you W applied population laboratory talking about a PC has on with contacts dot org finding a growth on the number of referendum school funding referendum was around the state\nIt's a good chance you have one in your community election day next Tuesday or that's rural or there's a different story it seems like in a suburban Wisconsin where they're asking for different kinds of referendum for different reasons\nCorrect so so we have a different story with the suburban districts and they are more more often going to these uh issuing debt referendum\n'em and they they on the flip side of the rural districts are are growing are seeing increases in their student population and so they're asking tech taxpayers voters to um to allow them to issue debt in order to pay for Catholics\nIt's renovating schools to to to accommodate these these increases in students\nNow what do we know about success rates amused tutors we've been talking about the rural and suburban our voters more likely to say yeah go for these days\nSo we are seeing I'm definitely a an increase in the number of passages of these referendum ... um and she doesn't eleven only fifty five percent of these referendum staff\nAnd up to this point as an Eighteen as of August I'm eighty five percent of them passed so it's a it's quite significant when you even just look from two thousand eleven she has an Eighteen so there is a there is a a more frequent passage of the\nTime and you can read the mind of every voter it every district for what he's referendum or their thoughts as to why and it's a pretty big jump in a referendum approval\nIt is it is um [noise] and there are there are certain um [noise]\nEconomic forces that will affect people's attitudes about voting and so that could be coming into play 'em as well as just the economy in general as we see an improvement in the economy people may be more willing to accept these referendum\nAnd uh we haven't covered that the two other areas that I Know I think the rural and suburban were the most striking parts of the story of and leave the town's kind of in between rural and suburban and there it seems like ... and we've talked to other people from the applied population wherever there's really depends on where that town is\nThat is that is so true rap um so the towns are are that geographic\nAh middle between suburban and rural districts and so I'm so depending on again if they're increasing in population they're likely to do more to the the debt referendum\nAnd if the are declining they're more likely to go towards the operational referendum um so so it depends on where you live\nAnd then finally there's the urban districts and there's just up for considered urban but they have a ... a lot of students in the\nRight so so urban districts have not gone to a referendum very much at all in this ten year window 'em and um they are very small in number and\nSo it's it's just um I I'm not quite I haven't really dived into the urban side of things what what's going on there if there's just not a need for it um and and their budgets are doing fine with with the resources they have\nAnd just to get into some numbers are we've got a bunch of referendum is coming up next week we had a bunch in the spring right or how many are we seeing around the state if we take them altogether and twenty teens\nSo and twenty Eighteen I'm\nSo far we've had Seventy four referendum Z and we're going to see another eighty two referendum in November ... on the on the ballot\nSo um that the November ballot um this represents sixty one districts of all of all these regions that we we spoke out the different locales and it's a total of one point four billion dollars it's going to be asked in November\nThat is a substantial number anywhere you slice of compared to past ears\nCorrect it is um it is the highest that it's been at least in this ten year window that we're looking at 'em and the last time we saw this was back in two thousand sixteen the number it was pretty close to the same number a little bit smaller but this is definitely the largest we've seen in recent history\nAll right well it's a lot to watch for on Tuesday in addition to uh you know races for governor in five minutes and all that thank you so much for joining us again thank you for having me by was Sarah ...

a habit that's\nMichael Moore and Morgan Spurlock are very big personalities themselves and then they were sort of part of what help sell those films\nWas hard for a lot of other documentaries to sort of match that and I think he wants to end up with having a situation where\nYou at least in terms of box office and in terms of wide appeal a documentary sort of tapered off of that uh until now\nWe've seen a his ear in particular if you can get a documentary into a theater with a big personality say Mr Rogers or Ruth Bader Ginsburg audiences are really interested in seeing personalities that they know and that they loved and seeing really in depth non fiction or treat subs them\nFor those are movies made without that big personality are the streaming services services helping them find their audience and vice versa the audience a you know that might not have been able to go to a big city to see it on the two screens that was on now they can find that more specialized documentary\nNetflix or Amazon Hulu and enormous in terms of getting a wide variety of documentaries out to an amazingly large audience I as you said people who don't live in New York and not way I don't have a nearly\nFor documentaries as are others and so you wind up with a situation where Netflix a documentary just show up on your TV or you know given friday that really has\nAllowed the streaming services to cater to a wide audience by doing a number of different types of things including as we've seen especially with Netflix true crime which has has has just been an enormous a draw for them and his I think really sort of help\nRe ignite interest in documentaries in general over the last two or three years\nFor talking to nix Segre film critic and culture writer or he was telling us about the rise the rebirth in some ways of documentaries in the age of streaming services Nikki wrote a piece for Esquire the best documentaries of twenty Eighteen so far\nOut what a tell us a couple of dinner at the top of your list\nHere at the top of my list is a film actually that sort of a documentary hype parade or called twenty four frame it by a world famous Iranian director named ... care is Tommy or he passed\nAway a couple of years ago and this was a final film it is a series of actually twenty four still photos that he sort of brings to life in the animated form it's a really beautiful sort of challenging meditation on on mortality and on the cinema itself odd\nMy other one and number two on my list is film worker which is totally different type of film it is a portrait of\nA man named Leon Vitale who for decades with family who were the right hand man and so the film is both this fascinating study\nOf sort of be genius behind the genius and also a study and obsession and what that can do to you when you dedicate your entire life to somebody else's Asian or both of those were a little out of the ordinary\nUs so it was my number three film biz be Seventeen which is a fascinating got married about a tragedy that took place in ... Arizona in Nineteen Seventeen that involves a lot of issues are having to do with immigration and intolerance that are making they're making a very relevant story today of does coupled with\nAs we said the big hits a\n... you won't you be my neighbor a and R B cheats also a film called minding the gap which was out on Hulu recently all of those films are really great it really has made it a banner year for a documentary\nAnd of those and others on your list really highly the diversity of documentaries because I think when people hear documentary or else because I saw when I hear documentary I think oh it's something that's going to focus in on one issue or one period of history or maybe it's a biography\nAnd it sounds like you're saying there's a lot of rain here in terms of a form a experimentation on some of these ... and ... there's a lot more going on out there\nThere is there's there's really a wide variety is it the films we've been talking about that or the big hits are won't you be my neighbor RPG and another documentary called three identical strangers\nAll of which have a really great mainstream appeal because they have great personalities at their center\nWhere they have great fascinating is real life stories that are sort of almost like page turners in a certain sense three identical strangers plays almost like a thriller in certain regards and a mystery or at the ... there were a lot of other films out there to challenge the foreman do sort of unique things with them\nAnd I don't think you know documentary filmmakers and and and documentary fans have to necessarily settled for them these films a lot of them wind up on your streaming services like minding the gap\nWhich is on Hulu who've documentary original it's about three young kids who grew up in Rockford, Illinois state borders and their story is just fascinating story that eventually winds up being a story not only about economic disadvantages\nAnd so there's there's a really wide variety and if it's a great thing about documentaries is it gives you this amazingly diverse if you are the life itself and so you know a fifth year particular has proven that could be the case\nTo give a listen to the trailer or from the one you were just talking about minding the gap or some uh three teenage boys from Illinois find their sense of self and family and skateboarding take on\nAmerican\nStyle I felt sorry\nIrish so like I didn't fit in with my family\nMy parents ran this very controlling how\nStake wearing a family then [noise]\nHow does that mean well they call it child abuse now a\nAnd moving your best\nAnd we have to really go out and then they've done\nAnd then somewhere along the line every one\nIt's one of the things that documentaries can do and that maybe take these characters who might be stock characters in everyday life oh there is some kids skateboarding and look at the world through their point of view\nYeah there was a real nuance to documentary filmmaking when it's done it it's fine it's a ... that really sort of almost unparalleled of when you have real access to these unique individuals even though they seem like kids you seen a million times before and a million movies are seen in your community or ... in the streets or\nYou know a film like mining the gap really lets you in to not only see their whole lives and

have too much time a Fernando that's a concern that critics birthright citizenship by habits on people game the system to get a they have a kid here in the United states and that's a that's that's the way into the country I guess the current concern that's often right\nWell that is ah the the main concern behind the the what what Republicans and particularly this president has call chain migration which is basically\nHe wants to and many Republicans have in the past that again this not a lot of these are new ideas and wanted to change the system to a more of what they call a merit based system to bring in more people that have higher levels of education\nUh and it is true that many people who bring in um new bringing their relatives bed as any immigrant that has gone to the system knows and many Americans have not obviously\nUm they it is very hard to bring it up quickly or any relatives that it's not an immediate relative and I mean by I mean\nParents a spouse and children anybody else in particular even adult children it's hard to bring and take some time however the the whole issue of bringing\nA and people by merit as as it's been suggested in the past was tried to ... and they try to include it in some of the\nUh pass legislative efforts in Congress and as you know all all of them have eventually failed but uh it's it's not a new idea but the main problem is again is for people who have a very low skills like the migrants are coming up up a from Honduras there's very little way for them\nTo come legally so when the president or the administration and say well go back and try to apply legally there's almost no way for such a low skilled worker\nTo come in there are only very few leases that tend to be very temporary and for very specific jobs like in the hospitality industry or agricultural industry which are those uh you know meant to be temporary in nature and general\nThanks to your calls I promise Fernando we talk a little bit about mid term elections we just have a minute or so left with\nWell I think it does somebody to talk right now but we were basically the autumn line as we know the Democrats need to flip twenty three feet\nA

of course we've learned maybe not to believe that until we get some surprises at the end there there's a higher chance of the Democrats to take over the\nTo take over the house and the Senate side is a little harder there are many races that were watching like the one to replace Jeff Flake a in Arizona or the one that a\nUS Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia faces a really hard call then is Texas Beto O'Rourke against Ted Cruz I'm not so far from you in the house we have the first district Abby Finkenauer\nAre facing the incumbent Republican rod Blum is one of the hot a\nHot districts of course let's not forget the open seat for Paul Ryan but um I think right now the way things are looking a I'm a house leader below sea uh said very confidently just a few hours ago\nUh that she thinks that the that the Democrats or want to go on to win the house but the the polls seem to seats to show the things that tightening a lot and it's going to be a very close call\nFernando thanks for joining us today my pleasure for ... the lawsuits reporter for one of his own he joined us for a week we look at some of the top stories in national news [noise]\nBounce time from Wisconsin my producers the gutter\nYou might imagine that a winter weekend trip to visit the ice cubes on the lake superior shore would be an adventure fund and discovery but one never knows what darkness lurks around the next bend me into will shares this two at a love story telling a bit presented by X fabulous in Milwaukee\nAre some people who really love the outdoors right\nI'm not that person I grew up in cities person Chicago and then Milwaukee I grew up watching horror movies black people don't do so well in those movies right when I think cabin in the woods I\nThink she is going to come in like murder you especially if you've had\nRight or like they're delivering style hillbillies around the end of a river and then as I started to get older I started to challenge those fears but that doesn't mean that I'm not\nScared it doesn't mean that right I still in the back of my head I think that there's probably something out there trying to get me but I'm just you know it's worth it it's it's worse that risk so like four years ago\nSomeone posted these pictures of the ice caves at the apostle islands and they were beautiful and they were gorgeous and it was all this like frozen ice and there's people with like ... bonds and they're like hiking out to the ice and I was like I Am going to be that\nPerson so as soon as they said like the ice is thick enough to go up out onto the ice along the lake shore and go into these caves I start planning my trip I got a bunch of friends together\nThan those friends invited other friends and it turned out we had eight people\nAnd I didn't know everybody\nAll going to get together we're going to look at some ice\nWe're going to hang out what bad thing could happen on this trip\nSo Saturday morning we wake up really early we'd go see the ice caves we spend the whole day looking at frozen water right we're just we're in it were taking selfies with ice it is due to fall for either I select\nTights and there's ice formations that were crawling on the ice and we got you know we're we're out there are thousands of people right come out to see some ice and so at like five pm that night we're cold and wet and hungry in kind of cranky and we have to find our cabin\nAnd because there's thousands of people who have traveled to find this I combinations are scarce\nSo we end up at this cabin it's like outside of a small town and it's down in a secluded road and it's up a long and winding personal driveway and the neighbors are ... miles away\nAnd we get there and it's a really nice cabin and you know it's got four bedrooms it's really big it's beautiful were drinking and getting to know each other we're playing games and laugh and it turns into like a dance party that goes to three am or like rocking out in this cabin\nThen we go to bed and the sun is kind of coming up it's really quiet and the cabin and they wake up and I have to get up\nAnd go to pee and I'm a little leery I you know and I go to the bathroom and I come out of the bathroom and I'm like you know I think I maybe should get a drink of water on the wall between the bathroom in the kitchen is a bloody hand print\nThat's part of the story and you've been on with us to talk about this before a lot of those rural districts where you're again and again they're seen declining populations in their community and\nA smaller numbers of students can you talk about how that affects their finances\nSo their their numbers are declining in many districts and so that means they get less revenue from the state\nOf the state says a part of the fighting is per student at your school\nWrecked correct so every it's a three year average but they they take those numbers and say okay this is how many students who have said this is how much are the are the the formula allows you to have a based on your enrollment and\nThe uh expensive don't necessarily Frank along with that right you can't drink your school size are you still need the buses to run the same routes there are a lot of fix expenses that don't go down even as a number of students go down\nCorrect so that and so when you look at the numbers and you see that I'm both revenue per student and cost per student those those numbers are higher in a rural district for that very reason\nAs soon as this part of what a big part of what's driving a lot of these rural districts to go and ask these operational referendum so to help make ends meet I\nBelieve so I Believe that that is what's what is happening in those districts is is to make ends meet their more frequently going to referendum\nHow much of this was affected by the directs the commitment a to schools and and are there solutions from the state level we've heard about what is it the scarcity and the targeting though these rural districts were talking about\nIs so what what has happened over the last several years is I'm In instead of look there's there's been much discussion about the revenue limit and how to fix the funding formula\nBut there had been on a small fixes like the star city aid ah which we call categorical a funding that that is based specifically for a certain types of district\nWe are talking to Sarah Campbell with the school enrollment projections program after you W applied population laboratory talk about a piece she goes on with contacts dot org fighting a growth on the number of referendum school funding referendum is around the state\nChamps you have one in your community election day next Tuesday or that's rural or there's a different story it seems like in a suburban Wisconsin or where they're asking for different kinds of referendum for different reasons\nCorrect so so we have a different story with the suburban districts and they are more more often going to these uh issuing debt referendum\n'em and they they on the flip side of the rural districts are are growing are seeing increases in their student population\nAnd so they're asking tech taxpayers voters to um to allow them to issue debt in order to pay for capital expenses like I'm building schools renovating schools to to to accommodate these these increases in students\nNow what do we know about success rates and these are two years we've been talking about the rural and suburban our voters more likely to say yeah go for it these days\nSo we are seeing I'm definitely a an increase in the number of passages of these referendum ... um and she doesn't eleven only fifty five percent of these referendum passed\nAnd up to this point in two thousand Eighteen as of August I'm eighty five percent of them passed so it's a it's quite significant when you even just look from two dozen eleven she has an Eighteen so there is a there is a a more frequent passage of these\nAre they can't read the mind of every voter in every district for what he's\nI have a pretty big jump in a referendum approval\nIt is it is um [noise] and ... there are there are certain um [noise]\nEconomic forces that will affect people's attitudes about voting and so that could be coming into play 'em as well as just the economy in general as we see an improvement in the economy people may be more willing to accept these referendum\nAnd uh we have uncovered that but to other areas that I Know I think the rural and suburban were the most striking parts of the story of and leave the town's kind of in between rural and suburban and there it seems like a and we talked to other people from the applied population of about this really depends on where that town is\nThat is that it's so true rap um so the towns are are that geographic\nAh middle between suburban and rural districts and so I'm so depending on again if they're increasing in population\nThey're likely to go more to the the debt referendum and if the are declining they're more likely to go towards the operational referendum um so so it depends on where you live\nAnd then finally there's the urban districts and there's just a fork considered urban but they have a ... a lot of students in the\nRight so so urban districts have not gone to a referendum very much at all in this ten year window 'em and um they are very small in number and\nSo it's it's just um I I'm not quite I haven't really dived into the urban side of things what what's going on there there's just not a need for it um and and their budgets are doing fine with with the resources they have\nAnd just to get into some numbers are we've got a bunch of referendum coming up next week we had a bunch in the spring right to how many are we seeing around the state if we take them altogether and twenty teens\nSo in twenty eight ... um\n[noise] so far we've had Seventy four referendum\nAnd we're going to see another eighty two referendum on in November ... on the on the ballot so um that the November ballot um this represents sixty one districts of all of all these regions that we we spoke out the different locales and it's a total of one point four billion dollars that's going to be asked in November\nAnd bats it is a substantial number anyway a slice of compared to past years\nCorrect it is um it is the highest that it's been at least in this ten year window that we're looking at 'em and the last time we saw this was back in two thousand sixteen the number it was pretty close to the same number a little bit smaller but this is definitely the largest we've seen in recent history\nWas allowed to watch for on Tuesday in addition to uh you know races for governor in ... and all that thank you so much for joining us or God thank you for having me by was
