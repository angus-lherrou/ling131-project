S. in what's now Russia from deploying certain ground launched nuclear and conventional missiles on Sunday President Trump told reporters in Nevada why he wants the U.S out of the deal\nAs highlighted the agreement\nThey've been violating it for many years and I don't know why President Obama for\nNot going to let them violate I knew\nWe're not allowed to wear the one we bought it for Russia as hot as the rumors are we going to terminate river and we're going to pull out\nSo what happened to us we use the deal and how much the two sides and other countries proceed\nAlexander bell is the senior policy analyst at the center for arms control and non proliferation she focuses on national security uses a Congress nuclear arms control foreign policy and other issues\nAlexandra thanks for joining us thanks for having me will tell us about boosting intermediates missile deal I'll just one part of the whole range of a nuclear delivery devices how important is this part of that\nYes the Nineteen eighty seven intermediate range nuclear forces treaty band missiles with a range between five hundred and fifty five hundred kilometers so about thirty four hundred miles max\nAnd it was created at a time where we had been deploying these missiles in Europe and in Russia is well creating a short warning nuclear attack threat\nFor the entire continent and it was really raising tensions are as a possible nuclear war on the continent to such a level that there was incredible public backlash and a real drive for Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev\nTo solve this problem they met in Reykjavik Iceland in Nineteen eighty six and\nAs a result of that summit they created the IMF treaty which has been enforced ever sense\nUse the ... right that Russia appears to be in violation of that treaty today\nYeah absolutely Russia has been in violation of this treaty ah\nThe bomb administration announced that violation back in twenty fourteen and we've been trying to get the Russians back into compliance ever since it's been a slow process the Russians have been sort of in a complete state of denial about the ... violation and\nUh the nature of the violation has made it hard to talk about in public which is sort of extended the process fortunately there was a little bit of progress last December when the Trump Administration used the the name of the missile out loud\nAnd um endless wars nobody likes that and probably fourth on the list is the immigration and I think that might not be that big of a problem but a President Trump has brought that up to the foreground\nAnd you are running on a kind of unique platform of direct participatory democracy yeah what does that mean how would you implement that as a member of Congress\nWell first of all of one big thing that\nWe do in Wisconsin is\nThe Wisconsin elections commission has all of our information the information over every voter on line so a person can go to my vote dot Gov dot W. i.s and find their uh\nWhere they are registered and and I could use this information to\nMake a secure ... vote\nIn anybody that was interested in voting on law and appropriation rather than just on a person\nCould do that through my website and through open source a software and uh I think it's important\nBecause right now are controlled by the majority of the money rather than the majority of the people and so uh I think a system like that is bound to happen because both democracy and a constitutional republic depend on the majority\nSo would you try that in your district if you were elected you'd on a particular vote you might say OK voters of the ... district or go to the website to weigh in on this and and that would save your ultimate decision I yeah\nI actually I promised to\nDo that to vote in the interest of the majority no matter even if it's something that I Would disagree with because I think it's so important that even if I was flooded by a a real conservative votes\nI Would on earth their vote and whoever ah participates would a half my vote and uh it's a\nKind of a radical idea and especially now with the president calling democracy mob rule but ah that that's ridiculous\nBecause like I said a democracy and republic\nDepends on the majority mandate and actually in my studies the majority are more progressive than conservative on most issues if you make the questions right most people do want a some kind of a um\nGovernmental universal Medicaid Medicare for all program and a lot of other issues are a little more progressive and it's just like if you take 'em Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton both of them in my point of view or were recognized\nAs kind of like a I don't know\nFor the elite in kind of greedy and painted on trustworthy so\nThen that was a tough election but even under that Hillary would definitely\nTrump and the majority voted for Hillary\nAnd before we get into particular issues if you're elected as an independent or would you see yourself caucusing with one party over the other how would you you have a laugh\nWhile I get to the way that it works I Would rather be caucus thing a more so\nWith the Democrats or I Would just if I did that on my own then I Would put it up on the website and I would put all the issues before\nThe people like hey do you what do you guys want a cop who do you want me to caucus with and and there's a who what kind of bills do we want to sign on to and then I Would make it open source of where how much money comes out\nOf the district so much when it comes into the district and ah what different projects do we want to invest in it and we want a\nIn our district of course we didn't but we want a four billion dollars given to a foreign company to a spring that company brings\nA business over here from the\nAsia or I I don't know I think they so important that the majority has with say that I'm willing to go even if it's against my more progressive more low Bernie Sanders kind of outlook on life\nTalk of the countries in independent candidate running for Wisconsin's seventh congressional district that soon at northern Wisconsin\nNow I Know you might send these issues to the voters but I Want to get your take on a few of the issues that you brought up as as important in your district in let's start with health care a big issue in this election what kind of health care policy do you think Congress should be looking at um considering\nWell just like my a gimmick credit to a point in that uh we both agree that there should be some sort of Medicaid or Medicare for all program to eliminate the private insurance industry which um I just looked up some of the\nCompany\nI think it was maybe Humanae and I think there's a United\nAnd some other CEOs\nMake tens of millions and even a hundred million dollars a year how many doctors could data provided how many other things that are necessary for good health of our country that are going into the insurance so um\nI think we can get a system like that going if I'm like some of these tax\nCuts that are going to the billionaires if they kinda got rid of that and um when I was working at a full time\nIn the industry I think it was like something like seven and a half percent or a deduction came out of your paycheck in order to pay for your Social Security and and and ... and other deductions that you had and if we could raise that out but\nA few percentage then you're not going to have to pay a private health care insurance so you will save money even the Koch brothers did a study that said some kind of universal national health care will save money but both sides don't really see it that way\nYou also mentioned that your constituents are potential constituents review issue of corruption and money in politics what kind of reforms would you want to look at\n[noise] well I'm starting out and I'm not raising any money I spent a\nProbably still less than a thousand dollars in my own money and I write a letter to newspapers and things like that and and I would hope that maybe we could get some kind of a public\nFunding and or something so that the public service on commercial television and radio\nMake it so that we could have ...\nAnd we can have more writings of uh people running for office and inform the public\nAnd to make it a fair system cause I'm up against the guy that has so\nAbout two million dollars and life research where the money comes from and it's mostly all corporations and mostly all out of faith so there's we can rights legislation to change that around and I think the majority of people are for it gets even the Democrats or Republicans anybody no matter what side they fall on\nThey all agree that the government is cricket it's something like up to Ninety two percent of the people surveyed anyway for sixty five Ninety two percent of the people surveyed said that there's corruption and too much money and soft\nImmigration ends up being a big issue around election time uh every couple of years it seemed like fight it's been a maternal issue in Congress are efforts to change the system nothing really happening what what'd you look for on the immigration issue [noise]\nWell I Would ask people to think about why\nThey why foreigners when it come here and what is happening in their country because like the Iraq War\nWe most people believe that uh there was no weapons of mass destruction and we know that they had nothing to do with the nine one one and we went over there and killed half a million to a million people and that says you know that that's terrible\nAnd um some people their work on our side\nSome you know they providing information and working with our soldiers and they're saying that they can't come here that's pretty nasty\nAnd then that same thing in South America there is like the drug wars in band or corporations coming in there and whatever buying up all the resources and making it impossible for people to earn a\nLiving without being connected to this corporate money and and the income inequality in these countries is worse than us so they want to make the United states into what they're making the rest of the\nWorld they want to make us into a third world and I think even if people think about it on both sides of the spectrum you can conservatives they're gonna have to go with instead of being conservative versus liberal they're going to have to go right versus where all\nCountries then we'll leave it there for now thanks for joining us today show up\nActivist and former union steward Ken Driessen as an independent candidate in Wisconsin seventh congressional congressional district race in northern Wisconsin incoming congressman Sean Duffy the Republican incumbent and that raises tentatively scheduled to join us this time Thursday\nHow fast forward to twenty Eighteen now looking back at article to what do you see as the most important limits on the power of a modern president that we should be learning when we read the constitution\nOne thing I talk about is the war power um the constitution is very clear and here I don't think scholars really disagree all the president's disagree a it's Congress that has the power to initiate or a ... and I'm declare war is the language it's used in the president's commander in chief so I think we need a new war Powers Act\nTo demand for instance that the first strike of nuclear weapons only be ordered by Congress not by a president I think we also need to fix or some sometimes the framers really relied on a president that would honor the constitution and another place I think that we need to fix his\nEye to defend a independent ... the special prosecutor from being fired without cause we need to go back to the old independent counsel rule so those are two examples I think of where we've gone astray let's kind of that\nWar Powers Act before I Move on to power from because this is not just a a Donald Trump issue a lot of money and it's been nuts stressing that people aside and said well yes there are troops here there in harm's way it's not a war though so I can do this as president\nRight and I'm very critical of for instance of a President Obama's use of drones in Libya where you know even members of his own office of legal counsel said you know this is a a to initiate war in Libya specifically you need Congress\nAnd I'm President Obama or didn't listen to them and I think uh that's just an example where I'm presidents of both parties certainly can go astray this isn't just a book about Trump it's also critical of many democratic presidents as well\nFucking Corey Brett Snyder author of the oath and the office a guide to the constitution for future presidents and you're right it's not just about what presidents do but also about what they say how to use what Cape recalled the bully pulpit under Theodore Roosevelt what should that a hypothetical future president a bear in mind\nI'm you know there isn't a lot of court restrictions on what a president can say but certainly the bully pulpit as one of the most powerful things that a president does and it was invented by Roosevelt and really turned into a constitutional ideal by ... by Wilson and then expanded again by Trump\nIn this sense a Wilson really had to rely on the press right to get his message across and turn to lobby Congress to pass legislation he wanted Trump is not really revolutionized the bully pulpit because he can speak directly to us through Twitter\nAnd possibly through our cell phones and the press is sort of an afterthought but with that great power I think has to come even more recognition of the limits of the office\nAnd the language of the bully pulpit has to be used to not just not violate the constitution not just not speak against it but to defend it and uh Wilson and Trump also have\nRhetoric in their disparage man I'm In Trump's example for instance saying that there are a good people on both sides of a ... in the Charlottesville dispute between Nazis and anti Nazis\nI that that is like Wilson and his a celebration of the Ku Klux Klan and I think we need to see this as a violation of the constitution because presidents are being elected to defend the ideals of the constitution including equal protection of law anti racism and so are these two examples are really a president's gone astray\nYou mentioned the hiring and firing of or a special prosecutor but you write more generally about uh the president and his or her administration's ability to fire civil servants that's an open debate on the Trump Administration got a long history in the United states can you talk us through how we got where we are today\nSure Wilson again I think in some ways is ah the bad guy and this and that he really didn't like the idea that many executive offices were um protected by Congress and the reason for that\nHistorically has been going back to the nineteenth century that Congress has legislation and part of the job of the executive branch has to carry out that legislation\nAnd so by protecting civil servants and and members of the executive branch from firing without cause or without and disregard of their basic duties I that's the way of Congress ensuring that the law will be executed and and that a president won't act as a lawmaker\nBut many presidents of attack that Wilson has one um I and certainly Trump is another and has it made that very prominent and I really call for a restoration of the idea that was recognize really since the Nineteen thirties\nOr an earlier that Congress can make laws protecting a it's a ... protecting civil servants within aimed to carrying out the law and that's nowhere is that more important than when it comes to those who were investigating wrongdoing of a president if a president as an above the law stands to reason\nThat a a special prosecutor has to be able to bring charges and can't be fired because of president wants to protect\nHim or herself the idea of the oath is that a president has to act for other is not for oneself and so this is an important place where we're that informs the need for protection of civil servants and certainly a a special prosecutor an independent prosecutor\nKnew of focus on the oath of office what ah what does the president a pledge to do when it comes to the constitution when they take office\nI mean really if you look in the article to the first few seconds an office or prescribe the president not only has to uh taken out there they're very specific words when Obama flubbed it at one point they did it a second time they take that seriously\nBut I think many people here the the oath and they sort of think of it as a ritual but the actual promised the oath is to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the United states not just the country but to recognize the rule of law and to go beyond the minimum of what's required to to really interpreted for one's\nSelf so that idea of article to stands for the notion of limits on on the president of the president's obligation to uh to to to respect the constitution even wine and this is crucial for me courts don't require it so maybe courts courts have not said for instance that a president can't torture\nBut I say that that certainly it is incumbent on presidents to recognize that the eighth amendment's tradition against monarchy and against um unusual punishments like your shopping\nOr restrain of president as well because of the of\nTalking to Korea Brett Snyder right now professor of

our campaign it's that year how to hold season [laughter]\nWell let's talk about an issue that is in common and a lot of election races the existence of the office of Wisconsin state treasurer there was an effort to remove it from the ... the Wisconsin Constitution or some of your predecessors a Republican candidates ran in opposition to the existence of the office\nWhat's your opinion on our need for a state treasurer\nWhile I Will be very honest with voters and stay Wisconsin I voted as a as a citizen this spring to actually eliminate the office I Am now running for I Believe that in its current state it doesn't make sense for taxpayers that's also the reason I'm running for this office I figured if\nA if one of the other candidates end up in this office when I have another four years would do nothing office\nAnd it is a very contested issue as well we sent to stay treasures to Madison that pledge to eliminate the office that one in general elections\nAnd then just this spring and the referendum the the voters ultimately decided to keep that office\nUm I think that's very important to note that in the history here um and I think that's really important to look at what the voters are saying in this case it's it's not crystal clear but I think it it's very clear that the voters once a small government office here in office that provides more accountability\nBut they don't want to vastly grow government and that process and that's really we're trying to set up\nOur campaign so what do you see if you're elected what would you do with the role of state treasurer\nI absolutely I wanted to make sure first of all this position is currently about three hours a week and it is getting paid a fulltime salary about Seventy thousand dollars a year that's unacceptable we need to make sure that this ... this state treasurer is contributing from day one\nI'm I'll be working with a legislator and make sure that we move this position forward um I have a plan out here on my website as well on Travis heart wig dot com for any listeners that would like to check that out\nBut we really want to do three things we want to assist in the audits of state and local government uh provide a little bit of elected oversight and that in that role I'm In the private sector when I was the middle man\nPiece headlined why more women don't when science no bells for the conversation Mary welcome to central time\nHi thanks for having me\nWell in that piece do you share a lot of research out there on women in all stages of a science technology engineering and math fields how big a deal is it to see these Nobel Prizes for women in the sciences this year\nI think it's a big deal it's a it's a sign of the times right women have been increasing in their numbers and STEM fields and so we would expect to see more women getting these kinds of words in the future simply because there's more women in the workforce more women doing this kind of work um but I I still think there are real substantial barriers that women face in in Tempe field\nWill get a little sooner most of our time talking about those barriers but you see some bright spots kind of a early on up women or girls of being exposed more to science fields and considering them as future options what are we seeing [noise]\nWell I think we've seen some really focused effort at addressing this sort of gender disparity in STEM fields on ally has been coming true\nSort of education policy higher education policy there I think you know in the eighties and seventies there was a real recognition that women were not pursuing these majors at the same rate that they were in the humanities and the liberal arts and so\nA lot of organizations like the American association for the advancement of science the American physical\nSociety chemistry society but also universities National Science foundation started to really develop targeted programs that would address some of these gender disparities whether that was I'm getting young girl is more interested in science things like girls can code and science camps for girls only\nCreate support networks for women moving through that pipeline and so we've seen real improvements in the educational pipeline of women in stem field uh women are are at parity in the medical science is the sort of biology medical scientists but they still are a bit under represented in fields like chemistry and physics\nAnd our other fields where they're particularly underrepresented\nYeah there's been some recent studies that have actually found that as the sciences we're seeing an increase of women in STEM fields there's been a real drop off in computer science and so there's\nThere's there's a lot of concern about sort of what's going on why are women not sort of increasing the number given that you know women are making up a large proportion of college students now why aren't they choosing these degrees\nHow important it is for girls and young women to the role models women not human science fields and successful over the over the decades\nThere's some there's some mixed ah findings on the sort of research related role models so I think and we all kind of have an intuitive understanding of why role models matter right when we see people that look like us or um appear like us in a high level positions we can imagine\nOurselves in those positions so\nThere's a lot of that sort of role modeling that's important to people and I think a bit more of how we perceive ourselves and how we perceive opportunities\nBut then the the role modeling and that's kind of most important especially in education systems in higher education is seen female role models in the classroom rate than people that look like you teaching the courses you're taking seeing professors in that field I and so there's\nThere's this sort of role modeling from the sense of like award winners are super stars are people we see on TV and then the role model in this really happening in the classroom\nFor women who decide to pursue science ... college bill what kind of a obstacles do they start to hit that may turn them away from it or maybe prevent them from having successful career well\nI think historically especially in ... there were real obstacles that were related to the the sort of structure of the job the way the science is done you might need to be in the lab every day for really long hours you might have to be on site you might have to go out into the field and collect data or collect samples\nAnd so there were sort of barriers to having work life balance or if you had a child you would have to leave the lab for an extended period of time and then you couldn't come back and sort of get your research back on track\nI think institutions have really tried to figure out ways around some of this ah ways that they can alter the structure of the science itself or the way that the job is the way that the job and promotions are designed a and\nThen there's this sort of other issue of harassment in the workplace which you know we've seen a lot in the news lately and things like title nine sort of formal policies that have said you you can't have gender discrimination in the workplace in the classroom and he's of obviously had really sort of important effects on keeping women in these fields\nTalking to marry me from Arizona State university looking at ... optical still out there for women going into science field here's one stat or from\nOther views were talking about you wrote a menace fight their papers fifty six percent more their own people should be ... their own papers fifty six percent more than women do so uh what's behind that what kind of impact that how\n[noise] yeah so this is something that's pretty particular to the academic workforce um citations are how much your research has been recognized by other people and so what some of his research has found is that men\nAre better able or feel more empowered to promote their own work to cite their own work and then they might also have networks that are citing their work more thoroughly and so it helps to raise their reputation the perception of the reputation the perception of the value of their work there\nPolitical science journal that showed the ways in which Google a scholar citations are biased against women I'm younger scholars and scholars doing really risky work and while these biases are subtle they can have real long term effect if your promotion your tenure\nUh the your ability to getting toward are being invited to give a guest talk is determined by this reputational effect\nUh and so they say teaching things are very particular to academic work but it's really important for scientists because that's a lot of how the scientific community\nAssesses the value and impact of your research\nAnd then letters of recommendation these are a big deal and the academic world is do I read this right all women who receive letters of recommendation from the professor year to get a job over there was more likely to be some kind of like disclaimer or ... or negatives Neymar qualifying statement and those\nAre like a language that sort of pull back on the praise of the Kennedy where you might see language that's like he is very smart he's really ambitious\nAnd then with the woman it will say well she's she's very ambitious which can get in the way of her ah getting along with others in the workplace or something right so the compliment will be will be pulled back with some sort of negative comment and while this seems well we can think of individuals situations where this does or doesn't happen\nThese studies are looking at you know applications across large cross sections of academic scientists and finding these patterns\nAnd we see this in job applications but also in applications for students to get into graduate school that the language they use to describe female candidates might refer\nTo their parenting abilities or their ability to get along and to be socially acceptable where the references to the male performance will be about sort of work performance\nBut our last few minutes on some of the solutions you propose one or a couple of things that you see maybe making a big difference in the short run\nSo I think one of the things that's been really great about this implicit bias issue is there's a lot of social science research looking at how this implicit bias works\nHow common it is and what the long term effects are of the implicit bias and so there's just been a slew of research and the last five years that's come out to really show\nThe way in which these biases are um creating barriers to women but barriers that aren't as a parent to us as not having family leave or not being able to take your children to work might be more obvious barrier that women face and so\nI think the research is coming out people are talking about it more in in response to these findings people are organizing and being more cognizant of how they make decisions about who gets awards who's nominated for things\nHow they engage in citations so one of the responses to this gender bias and citation is a\nOne scholar built a website where you can go and check your citations to see that their gender balanced you can run the ... by you're developing for course you're teaching to ensure that there's equal representation of people's work\nSo I think people are developing tools to help address some of these problems\nYou know a a layperson somebody not in the sciences might think well you know as long as somebody's doing science it doesn't really matter who it is but are we may be losing missing out a potential breakthroughs of a big part of the population isn't being given a shot to break into the industry\nYeah I I think that's one of the underlying reasons why science\nFunders like the federal government and why professional associations are really engaged in tackling some of these gender disparity issues in the workplace because diverse groups of people\nBring more ideas and more creativity to a team and as we've seen in the STEM fields collaborative science team science big groups of scientists working together to solve problems are becoming much more common and so when we have five\nCan together it it's just better for the science have people who come from different perspectives different backgrounds and think about problems in different ways they're more likely to come up with creative solutions\nGood place to leave it Mary thanks a lot for joining us today Thanks for having me very feeding is an associate professor and Lincoln professor of ethics and public affairs and the associate director of the center for science technology and environmental policy studies at Arizona State university\nThe legislature in North Dakota started passing different measures that have generally been fought to disenfranchise voters voter id and things like that\nThe most recent attempt to sort of limit the\nVoting rights in North Dakota came when the state legislature and the governor passed and signed into law a policy that said that valid voter registration cards invalid ballots had to include a street address with an actual street name\nAnd they specifically excluded\nPeople who might have a PO box as their address now that is thought to be targeted at Native Americans who live on tribal reservations in the state because it is appears to be the\nThe policy that many Native Americans have PO box addresses for facilities on their reservations but that reservations are not laid out with street names as might be suburban neighborhoods um and so the Supreme Court refused to sort of stayed this law\nSo the challenge will be for Native Americans to\nTry to vote in a state where they now don't have a valid\nStreet address that is required\nAnd this is a bet that law has changed in effect since the primary election there's somebody might have been able to do with that box ID A Ben and not now do we usually see a change happen that surely with that little time for voters and authorities to adapt you\nKnow we don't usually see legislatures move that quickly on anything really because in the legislative process all up and takes time\nAnd when the state's put into effect new laws they would often put in that saved that particular law into effect in a subsequent election but not an election that we're facing imminently\nSo the the process of passing the law was not irregular but it was unusual in that they didn't just focus on some um future election beyond twenty six teams\nWant to turn to Georgia now that's another state has really been in the headlines for a different reason and this is something that's going on in the\nHot seat purging voter rolls with students that they have to do so that people have moved on to the states are people who\nHave on our removed from the voter rolls but there are questions about how exactly done uh Georgia tens of thousands of people have their voter registration suspended we mostly African American what do we know about what's going on in Georgia\nThere are a couple of different things that are going on in Georgia, Georgia is using a couple of different uh probably two or three different mechanisms to um at least raise questions about voter registration rolls and individual voters\nAre the primary problem or the let me say the problem that is affecting the greatest number of voters or potential voters in Georgia\nIs the fact that George or the secretary of state to is the head elections official in Georgia has adopted what we refer to as an exact match policy to certify that particular person is a registered voter and has the right to vote\nSo in Georgia voter registration applications than name that a person puts on their voter registration applications must exactly match\nThe name that is in some other Georgia State database say for the vast majority of people um their driver's license a database\nNow if they if the state of Georgia receives an application for somebody registering to vote and there is not literal exact match than the\nVoter registration application is put on hold now what I say and exact match I mean somebody may not have put their middle initial on their voter registration form but they had put it on years ago when they apply for a driver's license\nOr somebody may forget to put the junior after their name or they may have a a compound last name\nAnd forget to put the hyphen in or something like that I mean we're talking about\nVery small details you could have the same name you got the same address all those different things but any tiny mistake voids the application and right now they're about fifty three thousand\nVoter registration applications that are being held up at the state level\nAnd as you said most of those about Seventy percent of them are for African American voters\nOr the other thing that's happening in Georgia and and this is similar\nUm using what they call a mismatch standard uh go in ... County Georgia has invalidated six hundred absentee ballots that had been cast before the election\nUsing that same argument that the voter registration application and that the signature on the absentee ballot somehow was different\nSignature the handwriting signatures that people put on their ballads and they're looking back at applications and if those two don't appear to match exactly than those ballots are being what we call spoiled there'd be voided thrown away\nVoters have a recourse to even know if that's happened\nThey do not they do not have a record in this particular problem I'm so for the absentee ballots that have been voided there is at this point than there is judicial intervention no opportunity for those people to cast a valid ballot\nIn the people who have their voter registration applications on hold the exact match\nThe state tends to each vote or a letter that tell them that their application has been put on hold for some problem um people in that category would be allowed to vote if they went to the polls and cast a provisional ballot\nBut it's um there are concerned about the way the letters written and whether or not it clearly states to people um that their application has been held up is not voided the right to vote\nSo they can search the concern among voting rights advocates in Georgia is that that people receiving those letters will interpret it as the fact that they are ineligible to those\nTalking to Kathleen Dolan distinguished professor and chair of the political science department at U.

that\nYes the Nineteen eighty seven intermediate range nuclear forces treaty band missiles with a range between five hundred and fifty five hundred kilometers so about thirty four hundred miles max\nAnd it was created at a time where we had been deploying these missiles in Europe and in Russia is well\nCreating a short warning nuclear attack threat for the entire continent and it was really raising tensions are of a possible nuclear war on the continent to such a level\nThat there was incredible public backlash and a real drive for Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev to solve this problem they met in Reykjavik Iceland in Nineteen eighty six\nAnd as a result of that summit they created\nThe INS treaty which has been enforced ever sense\nUse the ... right that Russia appears to be in violation of that treaty\nYeah absolutely Russia has been in violation of this treaty ah\nThe bomb administration announced that violation back in twenty fourteen and we've been trying to get the Russians back into compliance ever since\nIt's been a slow process the Russians have been sort of in a complete state of denial about the ... violation and uh the nature of the violation has made it hard to talk about in public which is sort of extended the process fortunately there was a little bit of progress\nRight up and the corruption and money in politics is up there and I'm English wars nobody likes that and probably fourth on the list is the immigration and and I think\nA problem but the President Trump has brought that up to the foreground\nAnd you are running on a kind of unique platform of direct participatory democracy yeah what does that mean how would you implement that as a member of Congress\nWell first of all of one big thing that we do in Wisconsin is\nThe Wisconsin elections commission has all of our information the information over every voter on line so a person can go to my vote dot Gov dot W. i.s and find their uh where they are registered\nAnd and I could use this information to make a secure Thomas rolled in anybody that was interested in voting on law and appropriation rather than just on a person\nCould do that through my website and through open source software and I think it's important because right now are controlled by the majority of the money rather than the majority of the people\nAnd so uh I think a system like that is bound to happen because both democracy and a constitutional republic depend on the majority\nSo what do you try that in your district if you were elected you'd on a particular vote you might say OK voters of the ... district or go to the website to weigh in on this and and that would save your ultimate decision I yeah\nI actually I promised to do that to vote in the interest of the majority no matter even if it's something that I Would disagree with because I think it's so important that even if I was flooded by a\nA real conservative votes I Would on earth their vote and whoever ah participates would have my vote\nAnd uh it's a kind of a radical idea and ... especially now with the president calling democracy mob rule\nBut it's a bad that's ridiculous because like I said a democracy and the republic\nDepends on the majority mandate and actually in my studies the majority are more progressive than conservative on most issues if you make the questions right\nMost people do want a some kind of a um governmental universal Medicaid Medicare for all program\nAnd a lot of the other issues are a little more progressive it's just like if you take 'em Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton both of them in my point of view or were recognized as kind of like a I don't know\nFor the elite in kind of greedy and kinda I'm trustworthy so then that was a tough election but even under that Hillary would definitely be a little more progressive than Trump and the majority voted for Hillary\nAnd before we get into particular issues if you were elected as an independent or would you see yourself caucusing with one party over the other how do you have a laugh\nWhile I get to the way that it works I Would rather be caucusing a more so with the Democrats or I Would just if I did that on my own than I Would put it up on the website and I would put all the issues before\nThe people like hey do you want you guys want a cop who do you want me to ... and and there's a who what kind of bills do we want to sign onto and then I Would make it open source of where how much money comes out of the district so much money comes into the district\nWe want a in our district of course we didn't buy food we want a four billion dollars given to a foreign company to a spring that company springs a fifth next over here from the\nAsia or I I don't know I think that it's so important that the majority has with say that I'm willing to go even if it's against my more progressive more low Bernie Sanders kind of outlook on life\nTalking to ... independent candidate running for Wisconsin's seventh congressional district that soon at northern Wisconsin\nNow I Know you might do some of these issues to the voters don't want to get your take on a few of the issues that you brought up as as important in your district in let's start with health care a big issue in this election what kind of health care policy do you think Congress should be looking at and considering\nWell just like my a gimmick crack addict or\nA point and that's uh we both agree that there should be some sort of Medicaid or Medicare for all program to eliminate the private insurance industry which um I just looked up some of the company and I\nThink it was maybe Humanae and I think there's a United and some other the oil is make tens of millions and even a hundred million dollars a year how many doctors couldn't data provided\nHow many other things that are necessary for good health all our country that are going into the insurance so um I think we can get a system like that going if I'm like some of these tax cuts\nThat are going to the billionaires if they kinda got rid of that and um when I was working at a full time in the\nIndustry I think it was like something like seven and a half percent or a deduction came out of your paycheck in order to pay for your Social Security and and and we've got and other deductions that you had and if we could raise that out but a few percentage then you're not going to have to pay\nA private health care insurance so you will save money even the Koch brothers did a study that said some kind of universal national health care will save money but both sides don't really see it that way\nYou also mentioned that your constituents are potential constituents review issue of corruption and money in politics what kind of reforms would you want to look at [noise]\nWell I'm starting out and I'm not raising any money I spent a\nProbably still less than a thousand dollars in my own money and I write a lot of letters to newspapers and things like that and the and I would hope that maybe we could get some kind of a public on being and or\nSomething so that the public service on commercial television and radio stations would make it so that we can have more ... and we can have more writings of uh people running for office and inform the public\nAnd to make it a fair system because I'm up against the guy that has so about two million dollars and life research where the money comes from and it's mostly all corporations and mostly all out of faith\nSo there's we can write some legislation to change that around and I think the majority of people are for it gets even the Democrats or Republicans anybody no matter what side they fall on\nThey all agree that the government is crooked at something like up to Ninety two percent of people surveyed anywhere from sixty five Ninety two percent\nCorruption and too much money and soft\nImmigration ends up being a big issue around election time uh every couple of years it seems like fight it's been a maternal issue in Congress are efforts to change the system nothing really happening what what'd you look for on the immigration issue [noise]\nWell I Would ask people to think about why they why foreigners when it come here and what is happening in their country because like the Iraq War we most people believe that uh\nThere was no weapons of mass destruction and we know that they had nothing to do with that I Want to watch and we went over there and killed half a million to a million people and that says\nYou know that that's terrible and um some people their work on our side\nSome you know they providing information and working with our soldiers and they're saying that they can't come here that's pretty nasty\nEnd and the same thing in South America there is like the drug wars in band or corporations coming in there and whatever buying up all the resources and making it impossible for people to earn a living without being connected to this corporate\nMoney in and the income inequality in these countries is wars that are so they want to make the United states into what they're making the rest of the\nWorld they want to make us into a third world and I think even if people think about it on both sides of the spectrum you can conservatives they're going to have that goal with instead of being conservative versus liberal they're going to have to go right versus well\nCountries soon we'll leave it there for now thanks for joining us today it welcome\nActivist and former union steward Ken Driessen as an independent candidate in Wisconsin seventh congressional congressional district race in northern Wisconsin\nHow fast forward to twenty Eighteen now looking back at article to what do you see as the most important limits on the power of a modern president that we should be learning when we read the constitution\nOne thing I talked about is the war power um the constitution is very clear and here I don't think scholars really disagree all the president's disagree\nA it's Congress that has the power to initiate wore a ... and I'm declare war as the language it's used in the president that's commander in chief so I think we need a new war Powers Act to demand for instance that the first strike of nuclear weapons only be ordered by Congress not by a president I think we also need to fix\nOr some sometimes the framers really relied on a president that would honor the constitution and another place I think that we need to fix his\nEye to defend a independent ... the special prosecutor from being fired without cause we need to go back to the old\nIndependent counsel rule so those are two examples I think of where we've gone astray let's\nKind I'd have more power and act before I Move out to her because this is not just a a Donald Trump issue a lot of residents have been nuts stressing that people aside and said well yes there are troops here there in harm's way it's not a war though so I can do as president\nRide and I'm very critical for instance of a President Obama's use of drones in Libya where you know even members of his own office of legal counsel said you know this is a\nA to initiate war in Libya specifically you need Congress and I'm President Obama or didn't listen to them and I think that's just an example where I'm presidents of both parties certainly can go astray this isn't just a book about Trump it's also critical many democratic presidents as well\nTalking to Corey Brett Snyder author of the oath and the office a guide to the constitution for future presidents and you're right it's not just about what presidents do but also about what they say how they use what came to be called the bully pulpit under Theodore Roosevelt what should that a hypothetical future president a bear in mind\nI'm you know there isn't a lot of court restrictions on what a president can say but certainly the bully pulpit as one of the most powerful things that a president does\nAnd it was invented by Roosevelt and really turned into a constitutional ideal by ... by Wilson and then expanded again by Trump\nIn this sense a Wilson really had to rely on the press right to get his message across and turned to lobby Congress to pass legislation he wanted Trump is not really revolutionized the bully pulpit because he can speak directly to us through Twitter\nAnd possibly through our cell phones and the press is sort of an afterthought but with that great power I think has to come even more recognition of the limits of the office\nAnd the language of the bully pulpit has to be used to not just not violate the constitution not just not speak against it but to defend it and uh Wilson and Trump also have this in common they both\nAre in their racist rhetoric in their disparage meant um in Trump's example for instance saying that there are a good people on both sides of a ... in the Charlottesville dispute between Nazis and anti Nazis\nOr that that is like Wilson and has a celebration of the Ku Klux Klan and I think we need to see this as a violation of the constitution because presidents are being elected to defend the ideals of the constitution including equal protection of law anti racism and so are these two examples are really a president's gone astray\nYou mentioned the hiring and firing of a a special prosecutor you write more generally about uh the president and his or her administration's ability to fire civil servants that's an open debate on to the Trump Administration got a long history in the United states can you talk us through how we got where we are\nSome ways is ah the bad guy and this and that he really didn't like the idea that many executive offices were protected by Congress and the reason for that historically has been going back to the nineteenth century that Congress has legislation and part of the job of the executive branch has to carry out that legislation\nAnd so by protecting civil servants and and members of the executive branch from firing without cause or without and disregard of their basic duties or that's the way of Congress ensuring that the law will be executed and and the president won't act as a lawmaker\nA but many presidents of attack that Wilson has one eye and certainly Trump is another and has it made that very prominent and I really call for restoration of the idea that was recognized really since the Nineteen thirties\nOr an earlier that Congress can make laws protecting a it's a protecting civil servants within aimed to carrying out the law and that's nowhere is that more important than when it comes to those who are investigating wrongdoing of a president if a president as an above the law stands to reason\nThat a a special prosecutor has to be able to bring charges and can't be fired because of president wants to protect\nHim or herself the idea of the oath is that a president has to act for other is not for oneself and so this is an important place where where that informs the need for protection of civil servants and certainly a a special prosecutor an independent prosecutor\nYou focus on the oath of office what ah what does the president a pledge to do when it comes to the constitution when they take\nOffice I mean really if you look in article to the first few seconds in office or prescribe the the president not only has to uh taken out there they're very specific words when Obama flubbed it at one point they did it a second time they take that seriously\nBut I think many people here the the oath and they sort of think of it as a ritual but the actual promised the oath is to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the United states not just the country but to recognize the rule of law and to go beyond the minimum of what's required to to really interpreted for one's\nSelf so that idea of article to stand for the notion of limits on on the president of the president's obligation to\nUh to to to respect the constitution even win and this is crucial for me courts don't require it so maybe quartz courts have not said for instance that a president can't torture but I say that that certainly it is incumbent on presidents to recognize that the eighth amendment's tradition against monarchy and against um unusual punishments like your shopping\nOr restrain of president of as well because of the of\nTalking to Korea Brad
