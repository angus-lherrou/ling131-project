definitely got a little uh a lot of political attention or can you talk about how they fit into the overall immigration story in the United states\nYeah that's a really great question we have seen the numbers of people coming from what they call the northern triangle countries owe Salvador Guatemala under as increasing in recent years and whereas in the past we saw a lot of the numbers of migrants were shaped sort of by the labor forces of the market\nThis really seems to be more about increasing levels of violence and those countries so I think this group coming from lunch or us right now\nA lot of those seem to be cleaned this kind of kidnapping\nUm threats of extortion really swing for their life or what we would call asylum seekers\nCan you talk about their legal status as we try to gain entry and and maybe stay in Mexico or try to gain entry into the United states\nYeah when we saw a few months ago back in April a similar group which media reports recalling a caravan it ended up in the uh it began in the thousands that ended up more like a hundred and fifty or so by the time that the last contingent made it to the U.S border\nSo I think we'll have to watch in the in the next couple of weeks\nHow many from this group actually come to the U.S border to try and request asylum and that's what they would need to do they would need to to credible fear interviews with our border\nPatrol and customs on which is basically where they would be assessed in terms of whether they qualify for fleeing persecution or torture\nPresident Trump spoke about this at a campaign event

just briefly as we wrap up our even at this stage in the game are you still actually sewing and seems ... uh costumes together\nYes we are going to go to the last minute for you\nAll next week and he actually even into the beginning of the next week\nThis is in a lung squash and the flesh and the skin is so delicate you can't eat that with the skin on elaborate roasted as well as stuffed\nFor the most part if you're going to be peeling an acorn or a delicate a or one of those big monsters like a Hubbard where you need to take an axe to it to cut it in pieces\nIt's probably best to roasted or steam it first if it's a smaller squash you can even throw it in the microwave for eight to ten minutes and then just scoop out the flesh from the skin\nThat said hang onto the seeds and that stringy pulp and your skin's because that makes the basis for a really great vegetables stock\nYou'll want to boil that down reduce it and then say that a pumpkin stock I found out to my detriment when I tried making a French pumpkin and white bean soup [noise]\nIf you don't reduce it reduce it and keep reducing it it does kind of taste a little bit like it's missing the earth the tones so if you can hang onto your appeals make a big batch of stock and really reduce it you'll have an amazing base for soup\nFood friday Laurie scalping is with us we are talking about cooking with winter squash you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four do you have a favorite recipe or to use winter squash do you have a question about how to cook with an eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four ... a recipe that you pointed to store Laurie we talked to a lady above the honest you would [laughter] where you are right now actually in the studio and you talk to her this morning\nYou brought in one of her recipes to the office the other day it's not just a recipe you made the rest we brought the food we tried it was awesome marinated winter squash does is that WPRI dark slash food friday what's at all that\nI've known about this recipe for ten years Libya has actually used it in more than one of her cookbook she loves his recipes so much you take butternut squash you peel it and butternut squash you can actually peel with a vegetable peeler peel your butternut squash slice that long lovely neck into one third inch thick\nHalf rounds and then you fry those rounds in vegetable oil about three minutes on a side until they're almost done\nYou will than marinate those pieces of fried squash in uh marinated that's made of reduced cider vinegar a little sugar a little salt lots of slices of garlic that sat overnight and then you blend in a little bit of olive oil\nAll you need to do is layer the squash with the mayor and aid throwing some days Elise and throw it in the refrigerator and let it sit overnight and this is my suggestion for a very easy\nSquash but you make it a day in advance it can be served at room temperature and that reduced cider vinegar merit aid is going to be sharp enough to cut through your gravy you Richard meets with out being so sharp as to overpower I think this is a brilliant recipe\nIt was a great mix of flavor as the smoking is of the sort of fried ... squash the garlic ah the vinegar it had a lot going on but or diesel to run on writer but all work together\nI thought so as I say it's a recipe that Lydia ... which has used in more than one of her cookbooks it's if you are not comfortable with frying things on the stove\nGive yourself a little extra time uh yes it is an involved a little bit of clean up but that's one dish out of the way well in advance of a big meal\nJust so many different ways to do like watching it like I said it was like you mentioned the ... the oven bake and you're just putting all water to thing ... when do we I usually do all my squash Virginia even a little bit of water a casserole dish whatever ... squash half upside down little water but you see sometimes you don't even need about water\nAgain with that honey nut variety you want to dry roses that you want to get that as ... as possible\nI think it depends on every cooks preference what he or she wants to end up with at the end of the meal\nIf you're roasting squash and you know you're going to stuff that maybe you don't want to have water in that pan you don't want to water log your squash if you're going to be putting a juicy you're filling into it so look at what you've got to work with check the consistency of the squash\nMight go to is yes turn it upside down in a pan with a little water\nIf you've got a drier squashed but you still want to add some moisture cover your pan with aluminum foil then again if you've got to moisture squash that you want to dry out for whatever reason maybe you want to use it for vegetables spaghetti then go ahead and leave the foil off and don't worry about putting water in the pan [noise]\nIt it may require a little bit of experimenting but the lovely thing about squash is if it's leftover and roasted you can match it up and throw it into almost anything\nRan our caller now eight hundred six four to one two three four Chris is with us in Adams Chris Hi\nHi happy and other gloomy day um this fall and Wisconsin right I'm\nA people always forget about this the ... and I'm like one of us that written refuses to throw anything onto the compost heap or not if but there is a trick to making them and I was going to suggest that people just throw the whole thing is to the oven and roasted that way 'cause then you're the steam and fight and they're ready to go\nBut if you're going to split it happened to the thieves out there's a trick to making them has to put them in a very slow of than at the beginning until they're always on and then throw some olive oil either of those films from Mari on top of there and they are so good for you though so healthy\nAnd they're just a wonderful thing for you to have later on your own or so when the kids come home from school they stuffed their faces with those you know he sees\nYou do them in the oven have you ever done them on top of the stove\nNo I haven't done that but if you but if you throw your whole squash into the oven to get it done this the thieves you'll just seem as if they're so you don't have to even prep them in any way you just monitor afterwards and throw them on a cookie sheets that's what that's\nWhat often happens when my boyfriend is making squash he wants one kind of flavor on the squash and then a spicy flavor on the seeds that's why he does his seat on top of the stove say he's making cinnamon or ginger for the squash and the other than he can throw some ... chili on the ones on the stove\nAll right thanks a lot for that call Chris we're talking with Laurie Skelton right now

well can you talk about some of what we know about that\nSure well so Baron is a is a very small town and this is out in in western Wisconsin It's about\nUh about fifty miles north of ... or so um there's there are about ... a little over three thousand people in the town\nOr the ... family actually live outside of town so it was just this rural Wisconsin I'm and see you know it's a it's a shock um this is a story that has garnered national attention was all over sort of cable news hum as there is the search continues\nAnd um I I yeah I think it it shocks people and and there are um\nYou know it's hard to it's hard to process or something like this happens\nThat this week something that happened you know I'm ... and some other uh places that counselors and and school resource officers out and out to there and help provide services to kids there um but yeah no I mean it's a it's a disturbing story where there's a lot we don't know ... it's\nAnd I will absolutely be protecting people with preexisting medical conditions which is the law of the land right now because of the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd that is non negotiable for for me because\nUh in my own personal life my father has Parkinson's disease a very significant a preexisting medical conditions and before he went on to medical or Medicare now he did benefit from the protection because he was able to get on to my my mother's health insurance plan\nSo that they were only paying one health insurance premium instead of two separate ones and uh I don't know where my parents would be if they if they would've had to go through the the the costs of many years of two separate health insurance premiums\nAnd I went to other people to be able to to benefit the way my family did\nTurning to the federal budget as a whole will be talking about that more later today are we saw a report a big jump in the annual federal deficit up about a hundred and Thirteen million dollars from the previous fiscal year what would be your approach to dealing with that annual deficit\n[noise] yeah I mean the the president's administration and the president or a Congress is a total fiscal disaster I mean you can't significantly cut revenue and increase spending and think that you're not going to balloon to the federal deficit\nSo I mean after the after the annual deficit was going down for six years I mean now it's getting it's skyrocketed this year already and it's protected get even worse than the and the next few years so I mean we need to\nActually have corporations\nPay normal taxes are the same as as my family does and other families do ah they they barely pay any taxes in this country right now any more because of that massive corporate tax give away last year and I'll be fighting for a tax code that works for the middle class and not for the court and not for corporations because ...\nOur middle class families those are the people that are buying the products and services a corporation so they're going to benefit from attacks go that works for the middle class\nThe cases that corporate tax cuts would or at least the attempt was that would lead to more job creation that ultimately would help those middle class families you were talking\nAbout [noise] yeah but the the the problem with that is that there were no requirements for corporations to do anything\nOr what I Would have done differently if I were in the house I Would have brought a corporate CEOs to testify in front of the house of representatives and open public hearings and have them a testify about what they were going to do with their tax savings I Would want them to stay under oath\nThat they are going to pass it down to real wage growth not these uh one time a bonuses that some corporations gave but real genuine wage growth in that way if they don't do it they lied under oath so I I think that's what our house of representatives needs to get back to is to actually\nGet back to bring people into testify and take the time to to study something and it ... another issue I had with it was that uh when you give a more more money into the pockets of a middle class family they're going to spend it in their own community\nI I Know from my own my own family I don't have any capacity to do a invest in Hong Kong\nBut a corporation is totally different they can they can invest their money if you're in the United states or they can invested in Hong Kong or Beijing so and and there's nothing in that bill that required them to invest their money right here in the United states\nStaying with us from international economic issues the Trump administrators should as imposed tariffs on Chinese goods on the one hand it also odd Canada Mexico and the EU US Steel and aluminum prominent among them what do you think of that type of tariffs strategy as part of an effort to get to as the Trump Administration says better trade deals\nYeah I I mean I Would call this number three issue in our district this year after healthcare and water quality is is tariffs are terrorists are hammering our our family farms here and small businesses\nI'm all for taking on a unfair trade practices but we are but these tariffs when you meddle with international trade when when you ... in metal with international trade so he's the little guy that's received a negative impact\nOr we are farmers don't have a market to sell their their soybeans and our dairy industry is is getting affected negatively impacted by the tariffs\nAnd my my my friend Tony owns a attempt business I went to high school with Tony and he had Fifteen employees in downtown Green Bay and they assemble tense but they received their vinyl for the they're like big wedding tense\nOr they receive vinyl from China and they receive aluminum and steel from Canada and the vinyl a tariff that twenty five percent and the aluminum and steel at ten percent\nAnd those are instant costs that have been added to his business he was planning on adding more employees this year but he's had to cancel the that plan so these these terrorists are truly a job killing terrorists\nTalking a boatload Joyce brown county assistant district attorney and the Democratic candidate in Wisconsin eighth congressional district race\nImmigration a perpetual issue off for Congress ah we've got a news this week a large group of migrants coming up from Honduras many of them hoping to gain asylum in the U.S what's your position on immigration issues\nWell we need to have an integrated a plan and to for for our immigration system I mean we our agricultural sector and in particular Rick uh depends on\nUh on labor from from immigration and so we need to keep the that pathway open so that our agricultural sector continues to have a\nA goat hardworking people coming in to fill the still do the task of our agricultural sector\nI don't think that we should be building a wall but I Do support given our border patrol the tools that they need to secure our border and I think that's in the form of\nA increased uh when whatever what the staffing that they that they believe is necessary to to maintain security at the border and the end to rely more on electronic surveillance and other in other types of surveillance to to secure the border\nIn the news this week the last couple of weeks this issue with Saudi Arabia and the killing of journalists them all ... G ... members of Congress are saying if the Saudis were in fact of involved us sanctions would be needed against them as a potential member of the house uh what would you like to see done\nYet we well we certainly can't you can't do nothing if that's the way that the effects develop I mean I I I'm a career prosecutor so I I Do a wait for all the the facts coming before I before I make a judgment about\nIf that is the the facts that this was a basically a a hit job than there needs to be a severe repercussion otherwise it shows tremendous weakness on on our part\nYou'd also mentioned water quality as one of your top three issues in your district so what would your focus be there\nWe have significant water quality issues in my district I so I think that's that's uh like I said earlier it's the number to issue here that that people talk about I mean we have area and the ... peninsula where you can't even drink the water coming out of the kitchen faucet in homes that rely on on wealth\nAnd I mean that is totally on ... on a acceptable in the twenty first century in in the United states\nAnd we still have issues with the with the Fox river lead into dead zones in the bay of Green Bay and uh that leads to fish kills and then there's a significant threat\nTo our Great Lakes that's on the Michigan side of the ... river\nAnd it is and this is one of the issues that I that I have with our present congressman is that he hasn't taken an issue or hasn't taken a position on this significant threat to our our our bay of Green Bay and that's the ... sulfide mind proposal\nAnd I can testify personally that there is spectacular world class fishing on the ... river and we need we need to protect that because of that river gets contaminated it goes right into the bay of Green Bay and then we're talking about a potential economic catastrophe as well\nThere are a lot of different ways the mid term elections can go one possible outcome as a Democratic majority in the U.S house in a Republican majority still in the U.S Senate in that kind of situation do you see yourself being part of actually getting stuff done and if so how\nYeah ... absolutely I think my ten years or experience as a career prosecutor and my my experience serving in the Wisconsin Army National guard a is makes me ideal to to work with both sides of the aisle\nAnd cut through the special interests that have that have a grip on out of Washington and I'm willing to work with anybody who was who wants to work towards improving the lives of my friends neighbors and family here in northeast Wisconsin\nI as a prosecutor what are your thoughts on efforts at a a reform of the prison system the United states are some people in Wisconsin and around the country saying we need fewer people in prison what's your approach to that issue\nAbsolutely I I think that we are sending too many people to prison I think that we need to we should have a significant investment in our probation supervision that we have in in our state of Wisconsin ended up at the federal level\nA it's a very expensive to to can find a person in prison and we need to be physically fiscally responsible and work towards actually rehabilitating people instead of a locking them up I'm\nAs a as a public safety issue the the prisons should be for people that are a danger\nCounty we actually have meant for different treatment court but I think is the model that that should be spread throughout the throughout the country and in many many counties do\nBut it's usually the rural counties that struggle to find the funding do have a treatment court as an alternative to incarceration and that's where the federal government can come in and the form of a of a grant to the to those rural counties\nGetting older and getting it Social Security with millennials getting older and wanting to get Social Security and wanting to make sure their parents and grandparents keep getting it so they don't move in with them on the support for fixing Social Security will be rather substantial it'll probably be a a a combination of using general revenues and and maybe some higher Social Security taxes\nFor the people who don't currently pay taxes that's over about a hundred and thirty five thousand dollars if you make that you don't pay any more than than as someone paying sixty thousand dollars in taxes\nBut um there will be effects I I Am absolutely certain that you shouldn't worry about whether Social Security will have\nEnough cash to pay your benefits at some point the future because it will the put the politics are such that it almost has to do\nIs there a structural problem a lot of baby boomers are living longer if you were younger workers paying into the system is that is that something that's going to be creating a problem\nWell it's it's a there's a little bit of everything a truth and everything you said um yes baby boomers are living longer or as millennials as the Gen x ers\n'em and Social Security was wasn't designed to pay people to to live that law expecting them to live that long member the average person who was sixty five years of age or older when Social Security was created that person was dead I'm sitting out the average age is much higher to benefits are going to have to be longer but also uh people are going to\nAh we've already seen that people don't retire at sixty five the way they do these two um and and don't want to and maybe it gave me they can't afford it [noise] ah\nSo um it's it's there is some transitional issues here as generations go on but you're probably going to see millennials working longer because they want to your ear you're using jet actors do that already which means that we pay Social Security benefits for a longer period of time\nTalking to stay on calling her from Georgetown University he writes at the budget guide dot blog we're talking about the federal deficit Social Security and more want to give a listen to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and we referred to a when he was saying this week and here's a little listen to what he had to say\nIt was very disturbing and it's driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security America\nThat Seventy percent of what was the boundary or the subject we were just discussing the bombing of the government is about thirty percent of what was oh there's been a bipartisan real walked off the taco entitlement changes because of the popularity of those programs\nSo Social Security Medicare Medicaid he says driving the budget deficit so what do you say to that\nUm my my the bottom line it did on my bottom line comment to that as nonsense um\nThat Social Security and Medicare are going up certainly and spending is going up but it's going up as expected to it's not like Congress and the president of agree to a higher benefits anytime recently but the big driver of the deficit this past year for example has been revenues coming in lower than expected\nA we had a big tax cut in December of two thousand Seventeen I took effect in January one two thousand Eighteen and revenues this year and the two thousand Eighteen a year that just ended on knocked on September thirty were two hundred and two billion below what was expected before the tax bill is an active\nSo have we not had the tax bill ad revenues said attacks last change stay the same on\nThe deficit would have been two hundred billion dollars lower it actually would have been going down rather than up instead of seven Seventy nine it would have been about five sixty five Seventy which would have been down by Ninety billion dollars for the previous years so\nUm the the the real problem here is that uh we've had a number of tax cuts and having a and we haven't realized they're happy as we were told were coming because revenues quote pay for themselves\nWe had definitive evidence now in the United states after two tax cuts where we were promised that what happened and in Kansas where and almost destroyed the economy that the tax cuts that that revenue cuts don't pay for themselves are\nNot all not ever ah so um as long as they keep cutting taxes you have to expect the deficit is going to get bigger and in fact that's what the projections are died\nThe deficit this year was seven hundred and Seventy ... this past year was seven hundred and Seventy nine billion\nFor the current near is expected to be one point one trillion and that's without any new spending I mean that's not without the president's ah infrastructure bill it's not what this military parade that's not what this space for city once um it's really I Know Mitch McConnell thinks instill likes to say as do conservative think tanks\nThat it's a spending problem but it's really you can't you can't look at this without realizing that it's it's revenues falling below expectations\nWere talking to stay on counter right now

W. ... and you W Manitowoc Elise welcome back to central time\nThink shot glad to hear\nAll these large groups of migrants or something called the describe them as caravan of migrants are that they make for a dramatic media coverage definitely they got a little uh a lot of political attention or can you talk about how they fit into the overall immigration story in the United states\n[noise] yeah that's a really great question we have seen the numbers of\nPeople coming from what they call the northern triangle countries\nOwe Salvador Guatemala under as increasing in recent years and I was in the past we saw a lot of the number of migrants were shaped certify the labor force is that the market that is really seems to be more about increasing levels of violence and those countries so I think this group coming\nFrom lunch or it's right now a lot of those seem\nTo be framed is kind of kidnapping\nThreats of extortion fairly swing for their life or what we would call\nCan you talk about their legal status as they try to gain entry and and maybe stay in Mexico or try to gain entry into the United states\nYeah when we saw a few months ago back in April a similar group which media reports were calling a caravan\nIt ended up and the uh the gang and the thousands that ended up more like a hundred and fifty or so by the time that the last contingent made it to the U.S border so I think we'll have to watch and see and the next couple of weeks\nHow many from this group actually come to the U.S border to try and request asylum and that's what they would need to do they would need to to credible fear interviews with our border patrol and customs um which is basically where they would be assessed in terms of whether they qualify\nFor fleeing persecution or torture\nPresident Trump spoke about there's not a campaign event in Montana this week or you just did without evidence that Democrats were were behind the flow of migrants so here's a listen to some more what he had to

approach to costumes I understand you make a lot of your own there\nYes we do yes I've been a seamstress since I was about twelve so I like to create them there are a lot of fun people give me ideas they bring pictures and or I just look on the Internet and come up with what up and coming are popular and we create it\nYeah and so what goes into a making a new costume\nUm\nInternet research is the main thing and then we figure out what kind of fabric we need 'em and then we put it together with a picture like I said and um which kind of\n... to um well we are rental business so we try to fit it to um the larger size so we can make it smaller if somebody is a different size so we have to consider seizing when we make them\nNow are you a big ... have you always been a big fan of dressing up on Halloween\nYeah my birthday today before Halloween really yeah so it's been a thing for me for many years [laughter]\nSo what is what are some of your costume highways over the years but do you

us\nI Do I grew up in the Nineteen fifties and we didn't have a lot of resources it was post World war two\nSo dry cleaning came in paper bags so we would uh children would take paper bags cut a hole for the head in the arms and then we would spend probably two weeks I'm ... with ... and paint and decorate those bags and that's what we were\nThat's great and do do they were all on themes I guess\nI'm I don't know about that we just probably decorated whatever and we would attach things to the bags um there was always some creative attachment and sometimes that didn't always work out\nUm it would be too heavy for the bag and it would rip the bagel part [laughter] you didn't care you just are happy running out in the streets collecting your loot\nAll right ... thank you so much for

thanks to all for all of your calls as well\nFor the most part if you're going to be peeling an acorn or a delicate a or one of those big monsters like a Hubbard where you need to take an axe to it to cut it in pieces\nIt's probably best to roasted or steam it first if it's a smaller squash you can even throw it in the microwave for eight to ten minutes and then just scoop out the flesh from the skin\nThat said hang onto the seeds and that stringy pulp and your skin's because that makes the basis for a really great vegetables stock\nYou'll want to boil that down reduce it and then say that a pumpkin stock I found out to my detriment when I tried making a French pumpkin and white bean soup [noise]\nIf you don't reduce it reduce it and keep reducing it it does kind of taste a little bit like it's missing the earth the tones so if you can hang onto your appeals make a big batch of stock and really reduce said you'll have an amazing base for soup\nFood friday Laurie Skelton is with us we are talking about cooking with winter squash you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four do you have a favorite recipe or to use winter squash do you have a question about how to cook with an eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four get to a a recipe that you pointed to store Laurie we talked to Lydia above the honest you would [laughter]\nWhere you are right now actually in the studio and you talk to her this morning you brought in one of her recipes to the office the other day that's not just a recipe you made the recipe brought the food we tried it was awesome marinated winter squash that WPRI dark slash food friday what's at all that\nI've known about this recipe for ten years Libya has actually used it in more than one of her cookbook she loves this recipe so much you take butternut squash you peel it and butternut squash you can actually peel with a vegetable peeler peculiar butternut squash slice that long lovely neck into one third inch thick\nHalf rounds and then you fry those rounds in vegetable oil about three minutes on a side until they're almost done\nYou will than marinate those pieces of fried squash in uh marinated that's made of reduced cider vinegar a little sugar a little salt lots of slices of garlic that sat overnight and then you blend in a little bit of olive oil\nAll you need to do is layer the squash with the mayor and they'd throw in some days Elise and throw it in the refrigerator and let it sit overnight\nAnd this is my suggestion for a very easy Thanksgiving side dish yes you're using squash\nBut you make it a day in advance it can be served at room temperature and that reduced cider vinegar merit aid is going to be sharp enough to cut through your gravy you're richer meets with out being so sharp as to overpower I think this is a brilliant recipe\nIt was a great mix of flavor as the smoking is of the the fried up our come alive squash the garlic ah the vinegar it had a lot going on but or diesel to run on writer but all work together\nI thought so as I say it's a recipe that lady of us on edge has used in more than one of her cookbooks it's if you are not comfortable with frying things on the stove\nGive yourself a little extra time uh yes it is involved a little bit of clean up but that's one dish out of the way well in advance of a big meal\nTo so many different ways to do and stuff like that\nAt you and you just put it all water to thing ... when do we I usually do all my squash Virginia even a little bit of water in a casserole dish or whatever or squash half upside down little water but you say sometimes you don't even need that water\nAgain with that honey nut variety you want to dry roast that you want to get that as ... as possible\nI I think it depends on every cooks preference what he or she wants to end up with at the end of the meal\nIf you're roasting squash and you know you're going to stuff that maybe you don't want to have water in that pan you don't want to water log your squash if you're going to be putting a juicy you're filling into it so look at once you've got to work with check the consistency of the squash\nMight go to is yes turn it upside down in a pan with a little water\nIf you've got a drier squashed but you still want to add some moisture cover your pan with aluminum foil then again if you've got to moisture squash that you want to dry out for whatever reason maybe you want to use it for vegetable spaghetti then go ahead and leave the foil off and don't worry about putting water in the pan [noise]\nIt it may require a little bit of experimenting but the lovely thing about squash is if it's leftover and roasted you can match it up and throw it into almost anything\nTo bring a caller now eight hundred six four to one two three four Chris is with us an Adam's Chris Hi\nHi happy and other gloomy day um this fall and Wisconsin right um\nPeople always forget about this season I'm like one of us\nThat written that refuses to throw anything onto the compost heap or not if but there is a trick to making them and I was going to suggest that people just throw the whole thing into the oven and roast it that way 'cause then you're the steam\nInside and they're ready to go but if you're going to split it and a half and safe as he is out there is a trick to making them they have to put them in a very slow of then at the beginning until they're\nFully done and then throw some olive oil either of those some Mari on top of there and they are so good for you though so healthy\nAnd they're just a wonderful thing for you to have later on your own or so and the kids come home from school they stuck their faces with those yummy sees\nYou do them in the oven have you ever done them on top of the stove\nNow I haven't done that but if but if you throw your whole squash into the oven to get it done this the the the Jill just seem to the side of there so you don't have to even prep them in any way you just go monitor afterwards and throw them on a cookie sheets that's what that's\nWhat often happens when my boyfriend is making squash he wants one kind of flavor on the squash and then a spicy flavor on the seeds that's why he does his seat on top of the stove say he's making cinnamon or ginger for the squash and the other thing he can throw some ... chili on the ones on the stove\nAll right thanks a lot for that call Chris we're talking with Laurie scouts and right now about cooking with pumpkin in winter squash you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four what is your favorite

Uber's\nRobert ... is a state wide living in storytelling editor for us to be network Wisconsin based in Wausau\nRob thanks for joining us why thank you for having me well Rob let's start with there's a disturbing story what's getting national attention a Thirteen year old from Baron Wisconsin missing I asked her parents were found shot out what to do a lot of the details are out there that we know what is the latest what do we know about what's going on [noise]\nWell there remains a lot we don't know about the a disappearance of Jamie clauses been missing since since Monday I'm with her parents were found shot\nUm the latest thing that we have learned this afternoon um is that there was a nine one one call from inside the home um police have not\nSaid who made the call but reporting today found that a quarter to nine one one call logs they came from her mother Denise cloth um we don't know who dialed the phone um but the law says that there dispatchers could hear yelling in the background um but did not directly speak to the caller\nUh so you know there's there are um you know multiple I'm a tip lines and a request for information out there to try to help find a Jamie cost us this Thirteen year old girl who is not accounted for\nThis is disturbing obviously for the families from your colleagues have reported on how the community of Baron is reacting hand or area communities just walking you talk about some of what we know about that\nSure well so Baron is a is a very small town and this is out in in western Wisconsin It's about uh about fifty miles north of of Eau Claire so um there's there are about ... a little over three thousand people in the town\nOr the ... family actually lived outside of town ... says this rural Wisconsin I'm and see you know it's a it's a shock um this is a story that has garnered national attention was all over sort of\nCable news hum as there is the search continues and um I I yeah I think it it shocks people and and there are um\nYou know it's hard to it's hard to process or when something like this happens that this week something that happened you know I'm ... and some other uh places sent counselors\nAnd and school resource officers out and out to bear and to help provide services to kids there um but yeah no I mean it's a it's a disturbing story where there's a lot we don't know ... it's\nWorking with anybody on both sides who wants to increase access to affordable health care and I will absolutely be protecting people with preexisting medical conditions which is the law of the land right now because of the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd that is non negotiable for for me because\nUh in my own personal life my father has Parkinson's disease a very significant a preexisting medical conditions and before he went on to medical or Medicare now he did benefit from the protection because he was able to get on to my my mother's health insurance plan\nSo that they were only paying one health insurance premium instead of two separate one and uh I don't know where my parents would be if they if they would've had to go through the like the costs of many years of two separate health insurance premiums\nAnd I went to other people to be able to to benefit the way my family did\nTurning to the federal budget as a whole will be talking about that more later today we saw a report a big jump in the annual federal deficit up about a hundred and Thirteen million dollars from the previous fiscal year what would be your approach to dealing with that annual deficit\n[noise] yeah I mean the the president's administration and the president or a Congress is a total fiscal disaster I mean you can't\nSignificantly cut revenue and increase spending and think that you're not going to balloon to the federal deficit so I mean after the after the annual deficit was going down for six years I mean now it's getting it's skyrocketed this you're already and it's protected ... get even worse than the in the next few years so I mean we need to\nActually have corporations\nPay normal taxes at the same as as my family does and other families do ah they they barely pay any taxes in this country right now any more because of that massive corporate tax give away last year\nAnd I'll be fighting for a tax code that works for the middle class and not for the court were not for corporations because when there's more money in the pockets of our of our middle class families those are the people that are buying the products and services the corporations so they are going to benefit from attacks go that works in the middle class\nThe cases that corporate tax cut to avoid a at least the ones that would lead to more job creation that ultimately would help those middle class families you were talking\nAbout [noise] yeah but the the the problem with that is that there were no requirements for corporations to do anything\nOr what I Would have done differently if I were in the house I Would have brought a corporate CEOs to testify in front of the house of representatives and open public hearings and have them a testify about what they were going to do with their tax savings I Would want them to say under oath\nThat they are going to pass it down to real wage growth not these uh one time a bonuses that some\nGenuine wage growth in that way if they don't do it they lied under oath so I I think that's what our house of representatives needs to get back to is to actually\nGet back to bringing people into testify and take the time to to study something\nAnd and that's another issue I had with it was that uh when you give a more more money into the pockets of a middle class family they're going to spend it in their own community I I Know from my own my own family I don't have any capacity to to uh invest in Hong Kong\nBut a corporation is totally different they can they can invest their money if you're in the United states or they can invested in Hong Kong or Beijing so and and there's nothing in that bill that required them to invest their money right here in the United states\nStaying with us from international economic issues the Trump administrators should as imposed tariffs on Chinese goods on the one hand it also ah Canada Mexico and he knew US Steel and aluminum prominent among them what do you think of that tariffs strategy as part of an effort to get to as the Trump Administration says better trade\nDeals yeah I I mean I Would call this number three issue in our district this year after healthcare and water quality is is tariffs are terrorists are hammering our our family farms here and small businesses\nI'm all for taking on a unfair trade practices but we are but these tariffs when you meddle with international trade when when you ... in metal with international trade it's always the little guy that's received a negative impact\nOr we are farmers I don't have a market to sell their their soybeans and our dairy industry is is getting affected negatively impacted by the tariffs\nAnd my my my friend Tony owns a attempt business I went to high school uh Tony and he has Fifteen employees in downtown Green Bay and they assemble tense but they received their vinyl for the they're like big wedding tense\nOr they receive vinyl from China and they receive aluminum and steel from Canada and the vinyl a tariff that twenty five percent and the aluminum and steel at ten percent\nAnd those are instant costs that have been added to his business he was planning on adding more employees this year but he's had to cancel the that plan so these these terrorists are truly a job killing terrorists\nTalking a boatload Joyce brown county assistant district attorney and the Democratic candidate in Wisconsin eighth congressional district race\nImmigration a perpetual issue off for Congress ah we've got a news this week a large group of migrants coming up from Honduras many of them hoping to gain asylum in the U.S what's your position on immigration issues\n[noise] well we need to have an integrated a plan and and to for for our immigration system I mean we do our agricultural sector and in particular Rick uh depends on\nUh on labor from from immigration and so we need to keep the that pathway open so that our agricultural sector continues to have a a goat hardworking people coming in to fill the still do the task of our agricultural sector\nUm but I I I don't think that we should be building a wall\nBut I Do support giving our border patrol the tools that they need to secure our border and I think that's in the form of\nA increased uh when whenever what the staffing that they that they believe is necessary to to maintain security at the border and the end to rely more on electronic surveillance and others and other types of surveillance to to secure the border\nIn the news this week the last couple of weeks this issue with Saudi Arabia and the killing of journalist ... a show G are members of Congress are saying if the Saudis were in fact of involved us sanctions would be needed against them as a potential member of the house uh what would you like to see done\nYet we well we certainly can't can't do nothing if that's the way that the the facts develop\nProsecutor so I I Do a wait for all the the facts coming before I before I make a judgment but if that is the the fact that this was a basically a hit job then there needs to be a severe repercussion otherwise it shows tremendous weakness on on our part\nYou also mentioned water quality as one of your top three issues in your district so what would your focus be there\nWe have significant water quality issues in my district I so I think that's that's uh like I said earlier it's the number to issue here that that people talk about I mean we have an area and the door peninsula where you can't even drink the water coming out of the kitchen faucet in homes that rely on on wells\nAnd I mean that is totally on ... on a acceptable in the twenty first century in in the United states\nAnd we still have issues with the with the Fox river lead into dead zones in the bay of Green Bay and that leads to fish kills and then there's a significant threat\nTo our Great Lakes that's on the Michigan side of the ... river and it's this and this is one of the issues that I that I uh have with our present congressman is that he hasn't taken an issue or hasn't taken a position on this significant threat to our our our ... Green Bay and that's the ... sulfide mine proposal\nAnd I can testify personally that there is spectacular world class fishing on the ... river and we need we need to protect that because of that river gets contaminated it goes right into the bay of Green Bay and then we're talking about a potential economic catastrophe as well\nThere are a lot of different ways the mid term elections can go one possible outcome is a Democratic majority in the U.S house in a Republican majority still in the U.S Senate in it that kind of situation do you see yourself being part of actually getting stuff done and if so how\nYeah ... absolutely I think my ten years or experience as a career prosecutor and my my experience serving in the Wisconsin Army National guard a is makes me ideal to to work with both sides of the aisle\nAnd cut through the special interests that have that have a grip on out of Washington and I'm willing to work with anybody who was who wants to work towards improving the lives of my friends neighbors and family here in northeast Wisconsin\nI as a prosecutor what are your thoughts on efforts at a a reform of the prison system the United states saw some people in Wisconsin and around the country saying we need fewer people in prison what's your approach to that issue\nAbsolutely I I think that we are sending too many people to prison I think that we need to we should have at a significant investment in our probation supervision that we have in in our state of Wisconsin and at the at the federal level\nA it's a very expensive to to can find a person in prison and we need to be physically fiscally responsible and work towards actually rehabilitating people instead of a locking them up I'm\nAs a as a public safety issue the the prisons should be for people that are a danger to the community\nUh in brown county we actually have meant for different treatment court but I think is a model that that should be spread throughout the throughout the country and in many many counties do\nBut it's usually the rural counties that struggled to find the funding do have a treatment court as an alternative to incarceration and that's where the federal government can come in and the form of a of a grant to the to those rural counties\nAny more than than as someone thinks sixty thousand dollars in taxes but um they will be effects I I Am absolutely certain that you shouldn't worry about what the Social Security will have enough cash to pay your benefits at some point in the future because it will the put the politics are such that it almost asked is\nIs there a structural problem a lot of baby boomers are living longer if you were younger workers paying into the system is that is that something that's going to be creating a problem\nWell it's it's a little bit of everything a truth and everything you said um yes baby boomers are living longer a as millennials as a Gen x ers\n'em and Social Security was wasn't designed to pay people to to live that law expecting them to live that long and ... the average person who was sixty five years of age or older when Social Security was created that person was dead or missing out of the average age is much higher to benefits are going to have to be longer but also\nUh people are going to live longer are they going to work longer or we've already seen that people don't retire at sixty five the way they do they used to 'em and and don't want to and maybe it maybe they can't afford it uh so um it's it's there is a transitional issues here as generations go on\nBut you're probably going to the millennials working longer because they want to your ear you're using jet actors do that already which means that we pay Social Security benefits for a longer period of time\nTalking to

like coming to that as nonsense um that Social Security and Medicare are going up certainly and spending is going up but it's going up as expected to it's not like Congress and the president of agreed to a higher benefits anytime recently\nBut the big driver of the deficit this past year for example\nHas been revenues coming in lower than expected\nA we had a big tax cut in December of two thousand Seventeen\nI took effect in January one two thousand Eighteen and revenues this year and the two thousand Eighteen a year that just ended on knocked on September thirty or two hundred and two billion below what was expected before the tax bill was enacted she'll have we not had the tax bill ad revenues head tax laws change stay the same on\nThe death and it would have been two hundred billion dollars lower it actually would have been going down rather than up instead of seven Seventy nine they would have been about five sixty five Seventy which would have been down by Ninety billion dollars for the previous years so um the the the real problem here is that uh we've had a number of tax cuts and having a\n... haven't realized they're heavy as we were told were coming because revenues quote pay for themselves\nWe have a definitive evidence now in the United states after two tax cuts where we were promised that what happened and in Kansas where it almost destroyed the economy that the tax cuts that revenue cuts don't pay for themselves\nAre not all not ever a so um as long as we keep cutting taxes you'd have to expect the deficit is going to get bigger and in fact
