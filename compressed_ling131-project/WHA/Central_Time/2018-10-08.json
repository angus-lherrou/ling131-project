country day dot org [noise]\nSpecial time I'm Rob fair and you're with us here on the ideas that were coming up the home care industry is one of the fastest growing in the United states workers visit the homes of older adults stop with daily tasks things like cooking and cleaning\nOut sort of a new book tells us we may not value the work of those caretakers enough first after a narrow vote on Saturday the U.S Senate has confirmed a judge Brett Kavanaugh as the newest U.S Supreme court justice\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the news or forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nKavanaugh will be publicly sworn into the evening does mark the end of a divisive confirmation fight after he was accused of sexual assault of three ... three decades ago in high school can be king ...\nNorth Texas she's been following the story with us Comey welcome back to the show\nAnd good to be back after a rough week and\nIt was a along in a difficult process let's start with this a procedural vote last friday or were you surprised to see the side a couple of undecided senators ultimately came down on\nYou know it's probably not such a surprise at the end of the day party loyalty right before a mid term can be very very important and I think that the guy\nWas cast when the investigation had a narrow scope you had the Democrats have done it differently had there been a more thorough vetting in this process it might have reached a different conclusion but we'll never know that because that's not what history has left us with\nNo Senator Susan Collins of Maine was one of those key senators Republican that some people thought might vote either way she gave that speech are giving a pretty strong defense of her position in favor of Kavanaugh let's listen to what somewhat you had to say\nIn the waiting any given in Salem misconduct we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the personification them in their hand thing so it may be\nThe center of town and give us a long discussion of why she ended up supporting Kavanaugh part blaming uh how democratic groups have come out against Kavanaugh what did you think of her overall defense of cabinet and her decision ultimately to vote for him\nSo I think Collins shifting mean is a critical marker in this even know Murkowski did not shift that Collins dead and don't forget mansion as a Democrat\nAlso shifted as well um they have to keep in mind what their party will do to them and support going in to the midterms or in the case that mansion concern that he has a volatile districts that might go read on hand\nIf he did not go along with the Republicans and so I think there are other things guiding this nomination including\nWell good for your call now Maryland is with us in central Wisconsin Maryland Hi\nHi where do you think what do I think I think it was sad but I think it ended up as fair share you know what what went on\nAnd do you think you are you happy with the ultimate result of that Kavanaugh will be a Supreme Court justice\nWell I had to listen to everything that was you know I couldn't make up my my mind truthfully at first but yes now I Am\nMarilyn thanks for the call a Jimmy Marilyn says she had her ... but she's satisfied with the process and the outcome\n[laughter] and I think that that's exactly the kind of hope that Senator Flake\nHad and being able to put forward and take that additional wake to do the additional work on the FBI\nBackground investigation [noise] I think the majority of moderate to conservative leaning Republicans would say that even though they had concerns about the way all of this went down that at the end of the day they're satisfied with it\nThe real question will be is are they still mad enough to show up at the polls and are they still motivated enough because they're concerned about who might be the next justice and white what kind of fight might they be facing there and so the real question is how it will mobilize people just like your caller\nA she's still going to go out to vote is she still gonna support all of those candidates as they head into the midterms\nThanks for call Maryland and the ... there seems to be a short attention span in politics I was talking the other day\nIt wasn't that long ago the biggest question that we're all going to be thinking about for weeks ago most who wrote the anonymous op ed from inside the White House always talking about that now does this nomination get crowded out by I don't know what's next I between now and election day\nYou know that's such a good question in American politics it seems like they're just these bombs going off every time we turn around and it's not clear and also remember I you you saw there's this in this kind of attempt to conciliation with Collins a speech he was trying to signal with her statement\nI don't think judge now justice Kavanaugh will be the kind of person who will over world rosy way that's what she indicated that was sort of more her hope than necessarily what might be reality but at the same time you also see people who hope that\nMoving forward that there if there's other information about Kavanaugh's comes out that the Senate Democrats will revisit that you already saw Cory Booker saying that if more information comes to light that Democrats most certainly intend to take this issue up and not let it go\nSo I think the best that you can save for right now is a huge are one hundred and fourteen to justice and the story is still not written about what kind of an impact he will ultimately have\nTo go back to our callers now I'm Marilyn with us in Winona, Minnesota Marilyn hello\nHello first of all I think your guest is a little bit biased towards the right but anyhow um my question is should we we wasting our time trying to impeach this person on the real\nTrump I think he should be impeached\nMarilyn Mackes McCall a Jimmy let's talk about the ... idea ah there'd be a lot of work a lot of hypothetical what Democrats would be trying to do they need the house and pretty much the Senate ah sounds like a long shot no matter what\nI think that it will be hard you actually saw a chief justice Rehnquist to say after the Clinton impeachment proceedings that he had grave concerns that the process had not worked the way it should have worked\nThe colors raising a great point about what the impact would be in the event that something\nWould be raised about the president legally let's just leave aside impeachment and drill deeper into the the bigger point that she's making there which is that there will be questions like immigration and DACA\nThey're going to be on the docket almost immediately and that is no longer about Roberts being a swing vote or if you look at Robert history part of the reason why he had such appeal for the Bush administration\nWas that he was very strong on supporting executive power\nUntil I think on issues that involved the presidency and the executive branch you will not be seen Roberts be a potential swing vote or a moderate he would go along with Kavanaugh and the majority of the conservatives to support President Trump\nMakes not called the next to Dennis in New Lisbon Dennis\nHi would you want to bring up that\nThe one that I look at\nAn\nAll right well you know even a Democrat or were still want to and we're more earned about ... or there\nAre things for the call can be done is to see people on both sides putting party over people maybe party over principle\n[noise] absolutely and I think one of the nerves that the Kavanaugh hearings touch just that we are so polarized we don't even speak to each other anymore we just scream passed each other\nI mean what is really a concern is that this folk came down there's only one of their vote in history that goes back to the late Eighteen hundreds that's been closer that to this and that Brett Kavanaugh decision fifty to forty eight and\nThat really signals a new low mark in what has long been an institution\nWhere you tried to see more of a consensus out of people I mean even Gorsuch and people were riled up about him even Gorsuch was a a nine vote margin for Gorsuch being supported a\nAnd then going back in time looking at a Lena Kagan I mean they all had and Sotomayor\nThey all had votes into the sixties or a ... and above in terms of support out of the Senate and so this polarization in our society is playing itself out in really dysfunctional ways in our institutions\nThanks for the call go next to Ed Ed with us in Greenville at high\nAfternoon go through or figure which ... which were thrown all is the evil geniuses will use the one who stole the American idol and a nomination during the last year or so long as the ... the Democrats misuse it was a loser all the way of getting back\nTo work on the Republican shooters\nGood good for the court it's going to be logical worried as ... areas that gets the pro business ... street courts where you're on a ... or ... or ... that we were you in your show\nThat things would call a lot there to me what's wrong with the role of Mitch McConnell and all of this\nShow I think that one of the great points that your callers making is this concern that there is has been a ... a turn to the right that is kind of off the radar where you see that isn't like Citizens United versus AFI the which allowed it unlimited\nMoney to go on behalf of campaign finance\nIn general this recognition that corporations have an individual identity that can be protected under the law [noise] those are some of the cases that are under the radar that we are missing the thing that's troubling and you saw some of that\nWith the Kavanaugh criticisms is that you didn't see this kind of viciousness with Neil Gorsuch\nAnd if it is truly the case that this is a vendetta on the part of the Democrats [noise] it's not a very well planned and get a if they were going to push they should have been pushing harder against Gorsuch\nAnd going back in time one of the things that I think both Senate Democrats and Republicans have to think about\nThe extent to which their loss of civility their\nDecision could change the rules to get rid of requiring a super majority before moving a vote forward the extent that that that had on polarizing us and further dividing us I think in the long term it's going to continue to be complicated because it will make it very difficult to get\nA consensus vote to on some of these judges that are going to be on for forever\nLike smoke call and and the last few moments gimme a crazy thought could there be a system where we appointed people who are going to be really good thoughtful Supreme Court justices without knowing that the Republican or democratic Supreme Court justices on the way you\nKnow it sounds nice doesn't it but unfortunately this is my standard answer the issue of Supreme Court nominations and everybody putting much on the line in terms of partisanship goes all the way back to Marbury versus Madison and Eighteen oh three when the anti federalist for hopping mad\nAbout president Adams trying to pack the court with what they consider to be federalist tax and the fact of the matter is we had been fighting\nAbout partisanship ever since it will always be that way because the founder set up a system in which the role of that deliberative body this the Senate has\nAre middle aged women and um ... depending on where you are in the country they're typically women of color or immigrant room and depending on the population that's most likely to be drawn into lower wage work in general\nAnd tell us a little bit I Want to meet some of the people do you work with a warning you open up a book with this is Maria one of the workers who took the idea that she was treating you are doing this work are the most curious what can you tell us a little bit about her story and her philosophy\nSure so Maria was I'm a woman who had been born and spent her early childhood in Puerto Rico\nAnd moved a if her grandmother there and I moved to Chicago to join her mother who was working in in Chicago as a um I think it hurts that of late adolescence early early teenage years um\nAnd she had had a young woman a series of her mouth I'm by the time she was in her early twenties she had um she was raised in several children on her own and find your way into home care work after learning about it from um\nAnother um another person up a public aid office um\nAnd so she had been in home care work or an elder care work of various kinds for several decades by the time I met her and I'm not developed a pretty strong philosophy of what she thought was important to know about care um\nAnd and she told me a number of important things but one of the things she emphasized was that good care of mine I'm seeing each person as a person of their own she thought that old age brought out the sort of um distinctive Nicolas every person on that part of her job was\nNot just to keep people alive or to um tend to their bottom needs at our house will need but\nAlso to help them uh experience themselves as a person they knew themselves to be so that can meet all kinds of things she talked about taking an elderly client who had been in the navy and left to sail to the beach to watch the water she talked about um\nAnother client who was a flirt and bringing her her a young son by to hang out with her and\nShe talked about another client who she prayed with an so she found ways to recognize unhealthy older adult sort of ... continue to experience themselves in the ways that they um\nFelt the most sort of in themselves um but she did that um without a lot of recognition of of who she was um or or what kind of person that she was so he's really relationship as she experience from weren't reciprocal she she spent a lot of energy\nTo feel like the persons that they were but never was really recognizes the person that she was\nTalking to we want to Bush about her new book inequalities of aging paradoxes of independence in American home care and you write in the book that this home care situation illustrates\nMaybe some wider values in American culture in one of those is a lack of value that we put in this kind of personal care labor emotional labor whether it's for a family member or for paid work can you talk about that little\nShore so I think I'm In the United states we hadn't said values um in all kinds of ways a work that we see as productive as helping insure 'em at as an investment in the future helping to ensure a kind of future that's desires\nAnd um we we spend less energy thinking about how to make lives\nLivable and celebrated and me every day and and that means that we also spend a lot less time thinking about the value of the moment to moment aspects of every day care um and there's a long history of this in the United states and not\nOn the everyday work of care whether we're talking about the work of childbearing or the work of elder care um\nHas often been the the least valued aspects of that have often been sort of a\nOutsource from a family members or to um either unpaid women of color or if we're talking about slavery or to poorly paid domestic workers um and so we have a long history of concentrating\nOur energy and attention on I'm producing more things and building our um building very um\nElaborate materialized but but maybe less attention on how to care for one another and sustainable way that you know recognizes the value of people in the moment\nAnd on the flip side for the seniors them so you are concerned you write that\nWe ever because they're not as productive or maybe productive in that sense we think about the economy here is that they're viewed less and less as individuals as people contrary to what Maria was saying at treating them as maybe more even fully developed people\nWe might tend to just loved him into this category of a of a problem to be solved\nAbsolutely certainly our national discourse and in fact international discourse talks about the growing population of older adults in proportion to the rest of the population as a major social crisis we talk about the great nominee or um the ways in which aging a and the number of people who are living longer lives as\nYou know a drain on resources and not ... is very much rooted in a sort of productive is value the value of you're not working and producing our future then you're a drain on our society or end you're dependent on so um we have systematically underfunded elder care\nUm especially the kind of of home care I'm an so\nWe see that older adult\nAnd a lot of energy trying to um avoid being abused through those stereotypes of dependency on and on productivity I'm\nAn answer articulating their value um but in the broader society most people end up being afraid of the stage of life which makes it ever harder to um convince ourselves as a as a community as a National Community to set funded and to\nThink about how to value and and and make this part of of life um integral to our our social

history\nIn Eighteen eighty two there were thirty three circuses touring America\nAmong the newcomers were five brothers living in ... Wisconsin\nHow auto L T Charles and John ring and seeing their first circus in Iowa as children all\nOut of the house before dawn to me the steamboat carrying and traveling show of the Mississippi River\nThat's part of a new four hour or two part American Experience documentary titled the circus that premieres tonight on Wisconsin Public television and Milwaukee public television at ... pm\nOne of the experts interviewed in the documentary is Wisconsin ... junior user curator of circus history with the John ... museum of art in Sarasota, Florida been studying the circus for fifty years Fred thanks for joining us\nIt's a pleasure to be with you well I Want to talk about that\nExcitement in the Eighteen hundreds of hearing that the circus is coming to town and age without the Internet or TV or her college football can you talk about what that felt like\nWell ... was one of the three big days of the year for children in particular it ranked right up there with a fourth of July and with Christmas it was a day when life wasn't lived as normal a maybe got loose from your chores you could go watch the circus arrive in town see the parade and then go to the show grounds to witness a performance and when you read\nRemarks bottom by people like him one Garland it was just like a day like no other day\nI Want to bring it home to Wisconsin you're joining us from bearable right now tell us how the ring going brothers got into the circus game\nWell it just happened that their family was living here unbearable and they came into exposure with other people who are showman and the late Eighteen Seventy is John and Allen the oldest of them went into the employee of a fellow named Dr Morrison um Delaware Wisconsin\nAnd they just prospered in group this idea of owning your own show and in Eighteen eighty two they started with a very modest hall show the play the opera houses around this area and then an Eighteen eighty four either own ability they put together some wagons of chance seating and they took out the very first Marta circus\nAnd really there was more uh to be seen from their own hand than from the other performers that they hired but people really recognize right away like these guys had determination they have skill above all the dedication and making sure that all of their customers had a good experience but they're circus\nYeah and this gets into a site in touch on I'll leave those for the article one weird thought I Want to leave quantum mechanics on before we move on the idea that our senses\nIntentionally disguise how complex the universe is so we can see the individual photons because our puny brains couldn't process at all if we got all that information you can handle the truth [laughter]\nThat's exactly it and and basically you know they've done tests where I'm can an organism gauge say the exact amount of water in a pool and\nNo but you can gauge how much water you I'm Will allow you to survive in other words you know if the water's too high or going to drown that you can gauge things that are directly relevant to you as an individual surviving and that's basically a physicists think how we process reality\nSo we're not really processing reality we're processing diversion that like you said are tiny little brains can handle soap my tiny brain just blew up with that knowledge but yeah it's a really cool story\nWon't pick my brain up off the floor now and move on you wrote about a ... this is amazing uh trying to find the DNA of viruses and bacteria to trace the evolution of diseases and this is something up till like literally months ago we didn't know if we could do\nAnd you know ... there's been a little work done like I think most people are probably familiar with the genetic history of the um plague\nA pathogen actually being the decoded so now we understand a little bit better how I'm great plagues events such as the black death occurred when I say great I mean huge not great like well\nSince then a two things have happened in the ... the field of Kelly of pathology and and the folks who the below killer biologist to try to figure out the back story of pathogens and and to think things have happened just in the last few months\nOne of them we have this flood of ancient DNA from humans that is actually being put in open access databases that any of these scientists can go and use which is a great great thing so we've got we've gotten better at extracting in\nSequencing H in DNA or it's now more widely available so that scientists from all over the world can access\nThe actual genomes and data\nAnd there's one more very important piece of the puzzle and that is an explosion in these new software programs that can basically I mean not to bring up quantum mechanics again\nBut they process so much information again makes her tiny brain explode and so they're able to process data that would have been impossible\nTo process even say a year or two ago just because they're able to handle such a huge data sets and do them very quickly often in a matter of hours\nAnd so now we're able to go back I don't know how far and look at viruses and bacteria that we couldn't look at you know the ancestors of today's viruses and bacteria and look at their DNA before\nRight well for example um again just a year or so ago having a three hundred year old sample of say hepatitis B was a big deal oh that was great you know three hundred years old we can learn something about\nThe past of this particular virus well in may a study came out and they were able to sequence genomes from several truly ancient hepatitis C virus samples including one that was four thousand five hundred years old and I had an interview scheduled with the uh authors\nAnd then all of a sudden another paper came out that sequence a seven thousand year old strain of hepatitis B so you know day by day they're pushing the time clock back further and further in terms of what they can see in these ancient pathogen genome so by the time we finish this interview there probably be an older one out there\nRight this is super interesting in of itself and it sounds like this can help us with the disease as of today 'cause it's useful to know how these things mutate how quickly the of all over generations this could be practical knowledge as well as\nInteresting historical information\nAbsolutely this is huge the study of potential epidemics and outbreaks for two reasons um bacteria and very very trixie things that actually steal pieces of DNA from other organisms and incorporate them into their own genomes\nSo they're always evolving very quickly and viruses have this crazy scale to kind of um resurrect big chunks of their genetic passed and\nBasically um become something that they might have been in the past\nThat that makes any sense kind of like a one of the researchers I talked to\nEquate it to an elephant suddenly having a wooly mammoth had 'em so viruses and bacteria are both really good at using a bits and Bob's of genes from themselves or other organisms to evolve very quickly but by seeing what they were like in the past we can get a much better version\nOf what they might become in the future a much better vision of it and you know hopefully epidemiologist and others can plan for that whether it be developing developing vaccines or early warning systems for epidemics\nSo it's really promising it's not just the history exercise it's very much future focused on tomorrow's medicine\nAre going to jump from discover magazine looking intriguing stories from the world of science so become superstition and a dinosaur let's start with superstition Jemma Packer fan superstitions failed this weekend brewer fan super citizen succeeded there's a lot of research out there it turns out on I kind of our our life stages of superstition what are we\nSay as an aside that I really wanted to watch the brewers games\nOn the last few days I intentionally didn't because whenever I watch uh brewer's game they lose although it yeah you know I I Want you to know that I made a sacrifice for the team did listen on the radio though which is okay it's it works on the radio it's just if I actually watch it on TV the brewers loose so anyway\nThe aura guy's not gonna be watching the brewers on T. V. for the foreseeable future if ever but yeah so that kind of thinking I Know even as I'm saying is that that's totally irrational\nTotally crazy doesn't make sense not revealed get over it Jemma right but the truth is that there's this period and our childhood we're about four or five until we're about nine I daresay I call it the Santa Claus years and that's\nWhen kids are gonna sign kind of like a magical thinking or oh that happened it was a miracle or that happened because I did this when there's no link whatsoever so we kind of outgrow it but not really because I'm sure everybody has\nYou know that thing that they do whether it's knocking on wood or carrying a quote unquote lucky charm when you're going for a job interview slipping in your pocket you know so we all do those things and the question is why do we do it\nIt's because we have two different ways of thinking one is very intuitive very fast\nYou jump to conclusions and the other is slower and more deliberate\nSo the slower more deliberate way we think knows it's a rational that there was no connection between what I watch on TV and whether the brewers win or lose I Know that the slow deliberate part of my brain knows that but that fast jump to conclusions part of my thinking is like oh that are not turn on the TV if we want the brewers went right\nSo basically we develop this kind of dichotomy within our own heads about we know it's a rational but we still knock on wood or do or whatever we're going to do because every time we knock on wood and nothing bad happens or we get the job\nOr whatever we're reinforcing our brains saying oh I knocked on wood and the brewers won or whatever scenario you want to go with what we should do instead we want to overcome this magical thinking is pay attention to those times we do watch the brewers on TV or we don't knock on wood and\nWe see that the you know bad\nOutcome that we feared doesn't happen and so by reinforcing when you're lucky charm doesn't work or you know what a black cat crosses your path and you get to work just fine anyway that's how you can retrain your brain to get over its rational thought\nAnd I promised people dinosaurs Jim I Want to get to wrap up new discovery I'll let you lead you must be must be a hobby yeah well thank you the name of the dinosaur big it's not the biggest but it's a big deal tell us why\nWell it was the biggest of its time and that's back in the early Jurassic you know in the Cretaceous which was after the drastic\nAll the dinosaurs you stand drastic park they were actually pretty much from the Cretaceous but it's just really hard to say Cretaceous park\nSo basically you had to really giant enormous ridiculous size dinosaurs and the Cretaceous but let him how to use from the Jurassic which came before it so it's a much earlier dinosaur and at the time uh most of the dinosaurs running around were like the size of a mouse\nMaybe the size of the dog they were not that impressive live a hobby if you can imagine it was twice the size of an African elephant comparatively was big in fact the researchers think this was the biggest dinosaur of its time\nAnd maybe it's not the speech with the development of those are really big guys later on\nA challenge is how we thought the really big guys developed later on because I'm researchers thought that the really big dinosaurs first developed the stance where their legs were like columns\nAgain like modern elephant and ... is that it was possible to get really big with out that particular posture and without that particular\nUh anatomy that researchers thought it was necessary to wear that much to bear that much weight but you know how they actually had very flexible lens and was kind of you know walking around\nDo you feel like Monica ... for me to do with the the Kavanaugh hearings that maybe more families are having this conversation now where they might not have a year and a half ago\nYeah I think that the Kavanaugh hearings in particular were a real wakeup call to a lot of families because they were so polarizing and because so many people heard Dr Ford's testimony and said things like\nI just can't believe it because I Can't believe that she would have had that happened to her and not told her parents and I think that those reactions are intern causing a lot of women or or other victims to say\nBut that's what I did add I didn't tell you about it and it's causing it's it's prompting a lot of discussions\nSo what does it say to you about the I don't know the dynamics of father what dad do how do they communicate about not just a fault but maybe about gender in general\nWell one of the things that I thought was really interesting and this came up and\nDaughters who said um\nMy dad I Know he loves me he always told me if anyone tried to hurt me he would kill them and as young women they took that really literally they took that as\nIf I tell my dad about this he will murder my attacker and then he'll go to prison and then it will be my fault and and so I think that there is um that that\nFathers are now rethinking the way that they can be supportive and the way that they can be a comfort to their daughters and maybe the sort of macho filled\nI'll kill anyone who touches my little girl isn't always the best way to be supportive and isn't always the best way to have a dialogue\nI I also think that we we need to have more open lines of dialogue on it in ways that that relate to\nGender but don't relate to assault\nUp an example that I brought up is the way that we talk about ... or the way that we talk about periods and how on and on sitcoms a man having to go buy a pack of ... for his wife or a daughter is seen as\nThat's shameful embarrassing like creepy experience and I think that once we open lines of communication about a lot of different things that will also be easier for us to talk about uh about assault\nAnother a theme that came up and ah it from some of your readers and also other we saw on the wide and reports a hashtag on Twitter\nAll was the thought that a father or anyone report to ... to judge the survivor the victim uh for being in a situation where I might put blame on them\nYeah and I think that that comes up is specially for women who have heard their dads are their brothers a talk about survivors in general in a particular way so if you've heard your dad to say\nWell she shouldn't have been wearing that or she shouldn't have been at that party or you know what did she expect with a skirt like that\nYou're going to be a lot more reticent to tell your dad about what happened to you because you're going to wonder what judgments he's going to make about about you and if he's going to immediately ask why you were at that party or why you had a beer or why you were wearing a short skirt\nUp you're you're just going to feel like it's not it's not worth it for him to have that perception of you\nWere talking to Washington Post columnist

you're with us here on the ideas that were coming up the home care industry is one of the fastest growing in the United states workers visit the homes of older adults stop with daily tasks things like cooking\nAnd cleaning the author of a new book tells us we may not value the work of those caretakers enough first after a narrow vote on Saturday the U.S Senate has confirmed a judge Brett Kavanaugh as the newest U.S Supreme court justice\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nKavanaugh will be publicly sworn into the evening this mark the end of a divisive confirmation fight after he was accused of sexual assault three ... three decades ago in high school can make ... professor of political science at the University of north Texas she's been following this story with us Kenny welcome back to the show\nThey back after a rough week and\nIt was a a long and difficult process or let's start with this a procedural vote last friday or were you surprised to see the side a couple of the undecided senators ultimately came down on\nLike probably not fat ticket prices at the end of at a party loyalty right before I make can can be very very important and I think that the guy like cat when the investigation headed narrows\nGo you know had the Democrats any differently had it any more thorough vetting in next ... might have reached\nNever know that because that's not what history has left us with\nNo Senator Susan Collins of Maine was one of those key senators Republican that some people thought might vote either way she gave that speech are giving a pretty strong defense of her position in favor of Kavanaugh let's listen to what some what you have to say\nIn value waiting any given claim misconduct we will be ill served in the long run if we banned and the person in them in their hands thing though it may be\nThe center of town and give us a long discussion of why she ended up supporting cabin on part blaming uh how democratic groups that come out against or cabinet what did you think of her overall defense of cabinet and her decision ultimately to vote for him\nSo I think Collins shifting mean is a critical marker in this even know Murkowski did not shift that Collins dead and don't forget mansion as a Democrat\nAlso shifted as well\nUm they have to keep in mind what their party will do to them they support going into the midterms or in the case that mansion concern that he has a volatile districts that might go read on hand if he did not go along with the Republicans and so\nWe'll go to your calls now Maryland is with us in central Wisconsin Maryland Hi\nWhat do you think what do I think I think it was sad but I think it ended up in a chair here enough what went on\nAnd do you think do you are you happy with the ultimate result of that uh\nWell I had to listen to everything that was you know I couldn't make up my my mind truthfully at first but yes now I Am\nMarilyn thanks for the call a Jimmy Maryland says she had her ... she's satisfied with the process and the outcome\n[laughter] and I think that that's exactly the kind of hope that Senator Flake had and being able to put forward and take that additional week to do the additional work on the FBI\nBackground investigation [noise] I think the majority of moderate to conservative leaning Republicans would say that even though they had concerns about the way all of this went down that at the end of the day they're satisfied with it the real question will be\nIs are they still mad enough to show up at the polls and are they still motivated enough because they're concerned about who might be the next justice and white what kind of fight might they be facing there and so the real question is how it will mobilize people just like your caller\nI she's still going to go out to vote is she still gonna support all of those candidates as they head into the midterms\nBenchmark call Marilyn and the commute there seems to be a short attention span in politics I was talking the other day\nWas not long ago the biggest question that we're all going to be thinking about what we used to almost who wrote the anonymous op ed off from inside the White House will be talking about that now this nomination crowded out by I don't know what's next door between now and election day\nYou know that's such a good question in American politics it seems like they're just these bombs going off every time we turn around and it's not clear and also remember\nI you you saw there's this in this kind of attempt to conciliation with Collins is speech she was trying to signal with her statement I don't think judge now justice Kavanaugh will be the kind of person who will over a rural\nRoad the way that's what she indicated that was sort of more her hope than necessarily what might be reality but at the same time you also see people who hope that\nMoving forward that there if there's other information about Kavanaugh comes out that the Senate Democrats will revisit that you already saw Cory Booker saying that if more information comes to light that Democrats most certainly intend to take this issue up and not let it go\nSo I think the best that you can say for right now is a huge are one hundred and fourteen to justice and the story is still not written about what kind of an impact he will ultimately have\nTo go back to our callers now I'm Marilyn with us in ... Minnesota Marilyn hello\nDo first of all I think your guest is a little bit biased towards the right but anyhow um my question is should we we wasting our time trying to impeach this person in the real danger to society as Donald Trump I think he should be impeached\nOr Maryland or for the call a Jimmy ... let's talk about the ... idea ah there'd be a lot of work a lot of hypothetical in what Democrats where would we tried to do they need the house and pretty much the son of a sudden like a long shot no matter what\nI think that it will be hard you actually saw a chief justice Rehnquist say after the Clinton impeachment proceedings that he had grave concerns that the process had not worked the way it should have worked [noise]\nI think the caller's raising a great point about what the impact would be in the event that something would be raised about the president legally let's just leave aside impeachment and drill deeper into the the bigger point that she's making there which is that there will be questions like immigration and DACA\nThey're going to be on the docket almost immediately and then\nBeing a swing voter if you look at Robert history part of the reason why he had such appeal\nFor the Bush administration was that he was very strong on supporting executive power and so I think on issues that involve the presidency and the\nExecutive branch you will not be seen Roberts be a potential swing vote or a moderate he would go along with Kavanaugh and the majority of the conservatives to support President Trump\n... called the next to Dennis in New Lisbon Dennis\nHi would you want to bring up that\nThe one that I look at people will elect the guy that people like Ron Paul Ryan well\nYou know even a Democrat or were do want to do that sort of compromise and we're more concerned about the part where there\nAre things for the call can be done is to see people on both sides putting party over people maybe party over principle\nAbsolutely and I think one of the nerves that the Kavanaugh hearings touch said we are so polarized we don't even speak to each other anymore we just scream passed each other I mean what is really a concern\nIs that this came down there's only one of their vote in history that goes back to the late Eighteen hundreds that's been closer to the Senate Brett Kavanaugh decision fifty to forty eight\nAnd that really signals a new low mark in what has long been an institution where you tried to see more of a consensus out as people I mean even Gorsuch and people were riled up about him\nEven Gorsuch was a a nine vote margin\nFor Gorsuch being supported a\nAnd then going back in time looking at a lean a cake and I mean they all had\nAnd Sotomayor they all had votes into the sixties or a ... and above in terms of support out of the Senate and so this polarization in our society is playing itself out in really dysfunctional ways in our institutions\nThanks for the call going to head with those in Greenville at high\nRisk afternoon go through I think Mitch McConnell is the evil genius in this whole thing you use the one who stole the Merrick Garland nomination during the last year the Obama administration and the Democrats misuse it was it was early way of getting back at the\nAt the look on the Republican senators for not allowing your early ... and I don't think it's going to be good for the the the the court or\nIt's going to be logical worried is ... is a red herring I think it's the pro business which layers of the uh the Supreme Court for your own out that's going to affect our country and ways that we were killed even just you know\nBad things McCall lot there can be what's wrong with the role of Mitch McConnell and all of those\nSo I think that one of the great points that your callers making is this concern that there is has been a ... a turn to the right to that is kind of off the radar where you see that as an like Citizens United versus FCC which allowed it unlimited\nMoney to go on behalf of campaign finance in general this recognition that corporations have an individual identity that can be protected under the law [noise] those are some of the cases that are under the radar that we are missing\nSaw some of that with the Kavanaugh criticisms is eight and you didn't see this kind of ... Neil Gorsuch and if it is truly the case that this is a vendetta on the part of that Democrats [noise] it's not\nA very well planned and get a if they were going to push they should've been pushing harder against Gorsuch and going back in time one of the things that I think both Senate Democrats and Republicans have to think about\nIt extend to which their loss of civility their decision could change the rules to get rid of requiring a super majority before moving a vote for\nWord the extent that that that had on polarizing asked and further dividing us I think in the long term it's going to continue to be complicated because it will make it very difficult to get a consensus vote to on some of the judges that are going to be on for forever\n... call editor last few moments give me a crazy thought could there be a system where we appointed people who are going to be really good thoughtful Supreme Court justices without knowing that the Republican or democratic Supreme Court justices on the way you\nKnow it sounds nice as in it but unfortunately this is my standard answer the issue of Supreme Court nominations and everybody putting much on the line in terms of partisanship goes all the way back to Marbury versus Madison and Eighteen oh three\nWhen the anti federalist for hopping mad about\nPresident Adams trying to pack the court with what they consider to be federalist tax and the fact of the matter is we had been fighting about partisanship ever since it will always be that way because the founder set up a system in which they were all\nAnd um envy

little bit I Want to meet some of the people that you work with a wand and you open up a book with this is Maria one of the workers who took the idea that she was training you are doing this work\nAre the most serious like can you tell us a little bit about her story and her philosophy\nSure so Maria was I'm a woman who had been born and spent her early childhood in Puerto Rico and moved a by her grandmother they're on and moved to Chicago to join her mother who was working in in Chicago as a\nUm I think it hurts that of late adolescence early early teenagers [noise] um and she had had a young woman a series of heartfelt 'em by the time she was in her early twenties she had um she was raised in several children on her own\nAnd financial and home care work after learning about it from um another um another person up a public aid office um and so she had been in home care work or an elder care work\nOf various kinds for several decades by the time I met her and um have developed a pretty strong philosophy of what she thought\nWas important to know about care\nUm and and she told me a number of important things but one of the things she emphasized was that they'd tear month I'm seeing each person as a person of their own she thought that old age brought out the sort of um distinctive misses every person on that part of her job was\nNot just to keep people alive or to um tend to their bottles and he's at our house will need but also to help them\nUh experience themselves as a person they knew themselves to be so that can meet all kinds of things she talked about taking an elderly client who had been in the navy and left to sail to the beach to watch the water\nShe talked about um another client who was a flirt and bringing her her a young son by to hang out with her and\nShe talked about another client who she prayed with an so she found ways to um recognize unhealthy older adult\nSort of ... continue to experience some cells in the ways that they um\nFelt the most sort of in themselves\nUm but she did that um without a lot of recognition of of who she was um or or what kind of person that she was so these relationships as she experience from weren't reciprocal she she spent a lot of energy producing\nOther people in a enabling them to feel like the persons that they were but never was really recognizes the person that she was\nTalking to we want to Bush about her new book inequalities of aging paradoxes of independence in American home care and you write in the book that this home care situation illustrates maybe some wider values in American culture and one of those is a lack of value that we put in this kind of\nPersonal care labor emotional labor whether it's for a family member or for paid work can you talk about that little\nSo I
