that tobacco marketing is being targeted targeted at minority communities in Milwaukee\nWill break down what they found coming up first the Centers for Disease Control and prevention released a report last week I'm vaccination rates in each state according to that report Wisconsin kindergarten students are getting exempted from getting vaccines at a higher rate than the national average\nAcross much of the country a little more than two percent of kindergarten or go without vaccinations in Wisconsin that number is just over five percent\nDr Joseph McBride as a practicing physician who specializes in infectious diseases he's part of you W school of medicine and public health Dr McBride thanks a lot for coming up to the studio thanks so much for having me well what's your reaction when you see these numbers yeah it's uh certainly it's surprising to see such high numbers here in Wisconsin we really value on\nI think we value public health at a high amount\nUm and to see these numbers as high as they are especially compared to other states throughout the country\nIs a surprising trend that we'd like to reverse that we see a number like a five percent getting these exemptions from vaccines\nFlipping around Ninety five percent are getting vaccine that sounds like a lot of what's the threshold for when we get worried when there's too many unvaccinated kid yeah great question so usually under the around Ninety to Ninety five percent is when we start to worry\nCertainly once we get below Ninety percent that's when a big concern happens\nObviously with the concept of herd immunity the higher one hundred percent that you can get the better um so I don't think we're necessarily in panic mode at this point but there certainly is areas for improvement\nWhat do we know about long term trends I Know there's different ways of measuring even in this report from state to state so it it might be hard to compare apples to apples but what do we know about how things have changed in Wisconsin\nWell what can we can say at least for the last couple of years when the study was was performed was that there hasn't been a lot of changes over the last twenty four months or so so it seems that the exit exemption rate that people are are having for vaccinations has remained constant over the last few years and\nWithout a lot of changes in legislature or our public health policies I don't necessarily foresee a big change in that let's talk about these exemptions there's a couple of reasons kids can knock it\nVaccine some there are medical reasons ah we're a vaccine might be unhealthy for them that's a smaller part of it it sounds like more of them are done under the rubric of like philosophical objections\nTo vaccines right yeah so\nI'm just to put things in perspective a little bit we had a little bit over sixty six thousand a kindergartners in Wisconsin starts school last year\nAnd looking at the numbers of exemptions we had about one hundred sixty four a medical exemptions and this could be a wide range of medical problems uh for things that encompass immune deficiencies and people maybe people who are going through chemotherapy for cancers um or people who have true allergies to a vaccine\nUm but then in Wisconsin we have to other forms of exemptions\nAnd one is a religious exemption and then another one is a a parental role um preference not to have the vaccine\nAnd if you look at the numbers are that is overwhelming that the largest amount a well over Ninety percent of the exemptions fall under this a personal decision not to get the vaccine um and that is just really too high a for our overall herd immunity and our health\nAnd over you this is new research I'm guessing it's not surprising research are from the work you're doing you\nKnow it's not surprising um and when you look at the history of the back\nOf an targeting African Americans within the industry it has a historical loans that goes far beyond\nEven know what I was born and you know during World War two the crackling history marketed to the military servicemen are products and cigarettes were viewed as a stress ... or ... or ... you know because it's for that um but and perhaps one African American American men were exposed to that had like ... it's a ...\nUm during that time\nWithin who ... through the annual income African American increased threefold from three in the morning then building making the pop a population has those individuals and increasingly appealing demographic or the tobacco industry\nAnd can you talk about the impact of tobacco today in minority communities are here in Wisconsin and beyond yes\nUm there are no ... well I'm an African Americans are targeted I'm way more than their counterparts in regards to cigarettes specifically menthol cigarettes because there's an easier way to become addicted to\nThem do ... I'm In the case isn't as harsh as regular cigarettes um so the marketing within the industry they carved at them to these populations on one because there is a consumer base there too there's a lack of knowledge and awareness and as you know around the menthol cigarettes as well\nAnd when they are used kind of a a toolkit as you say this kind of research has been done in other communities around the country can you talk about how that works in and how Milwaukee ... to some other cities that might have been research in the past\nBut we use is called the stars tools so it's it's really available online supposed to standardize tobacco assessment for retail settings and it was developed by the CDC and the MCI and some other federal and state groups\nAnd so we have people go out into the stores and it's basically a checklist and so it's called the store bought it and you know you got to pay how much are cigarettes here where the cigarettes placed is their mental advertising\nStuff like that um and so you know unfortunately I Would say that our findings put us up there with you know the the cities where this is the struggling feeding articulate um\nIt's really not good news um to put it frankly what we are really seeing really strong targeting of these populations in the same way that you would see in other major cities in the U.S\nAnd a stark difference you ride in the report between ah the more white primarily white ZIP Code you looked at versus the minority one's a pretty big difference on how\nTo give you one example I'm the sale of small cigars for less than a dollar so you're really affordable tobacco product eighty one per cent stores in the African American neighborhoods were doing this compared to just about fifty percent into white neighborhoods\nAnd uh how about the marketing for kids how how much more prevalent was that as you said uh cigarettes mix the candy say in the African American neighborhoods versus the white neighborhood\nThe cigarettes next to candy was just a ... we found that in five per cent stores into white neighborhoods compared to forty two percent of African American neighborhoods\nAbout that especially the angle of a tobacco products being planes ... the marketing towards kids in minority neighborhoods in particular for\nMe are you there yeah I'm here okay so there is there like there's definitely a use of\nDifferent ways like ... ... was the combat specially um youngsters ... battle company to promote the promotions for one such as those comments and mouth I packed coupons and brand and give like such a T shirts lighter than other bit of ... good I'm even utilizing candy as the use of advertisements to get the youngsters cut by tobacco\nProducts um attracting low income and it was such a African American customers unlimited\nAlso looking at my walk more closely on the promotion might involve received like there are parts of someone item\nUm involving um good old things of that laser including soaked cynical was allowing the server that might require that some parts of two or even from time to receive the same promotion for the wrong people owned by even given away free will\nNot going to obey will booze or what the American Heart association and the Wisconsin African American tobacco prevention network andme ... public health researcher their coauthor of a new study finding tobacco products targeted more strongly in minority neighborhoods in Milwaukee\nOver you been working on these issues on on prevention of tobacco use among African American what kind of changes would you like to see\n[noise]\nI Would like us for really hone in on the products and with the little bully flavored tobacco products now these are the solutions that with the American Heart Association and primarily the Wisconsin African American tobacco\nPrevention network that we're looking to really hone in on this issue I'm an ... of products from other states that he's in a ...\nBecause they end up in other areas some working so old old continued to blaze like others I might as well as\n... ... ... ... ... ... um lead to lose condense he's fought all the young student individually community um\nRestrict product placement so they're not at all levels of all it's all about because we didn't see that there are about Coby teleconference so the industrial city of Milwaukee then restrict tobacco\nSo some use it for schools carts and social organization rules with regulations on policies\nThat around like I'm having a gun on your carry on that should be the same around\nJustice for backup products\nAnd when they are when others who you just have this kind of research do you have there been changes like OB was talking about a regulations on some of the things we're talking about how where or how much tobacco products are marketed\nYeah the other the definitely made strides here so our neighbors Chicago for example have banned the sale of flavored tobacco including menthol within five\nHundred feet at schools which you know it's a logical thing to do given that these ... are really targeting young people the problem Milwaukee has is that we will almost certainly can't do that because a lot of tobacco\nWith preempted by the state so a lot of these things that could be done locally we can't do here because their state powers that Wisconsin\nAnd obey argue reaching out to stores or change the stores directly I in addition to pushing for regulation\nCorrect the Wisconsin African American tobacco\nPrevention network has multiple committees on one below dealing with the housing smoking and housing and that\nJust ends up on all policy around most smoke ... and um and then also you have a group that deals with single cigarette smoking 'cause that's also a problem I'm aware of companies are we so we gotta allow single out\nHold on them that they were getting them stand that this is not allowed in ...\nAnd ... what do we know about so when kids are exposed to tobacco products on their marketed to them how much of an impact that has on them smoking as teens for example and beyond\nThat we do know that the more children are exposed to tobacco in the store environment as kids the more likely the artist start smoking as adolescence we all know that for I don't want to quit smoking it makes it harder if you go to a store and you're just bombarded with tobacco advertising so there's a whole real life span effect of this advertising\nAnd obey uh you've been working on this issue for awhile yourself why is this report or are you hoping this report is a wakeup call for for some kind of action on the back of marketing\nYes Beth and I'm hoping that any case starts to become more aware of it is one thing he says but then there's one thing that we have to also go out and educate the masses and to see how they gave us this is a problem in their communities now retailers are\n... says they're targeting there how are they supposed to start is to help and really assessing the houses policies systems that environment around this issue there I'm hurting it can they can show that he just said it is an individual is law was before this is science clean\nAnd money I just mentioned the social determinants of smoking and I think a lot of times people think of tobacco use as an individual decision a choice someone makes how important is it in prevention to think about\nYou know the design of we're smoking is marketed where you just said they'll lay out of a community or even determining who's going to smoke and who doesn't\nIt's usually I mean ultimately we we make a good decision but those are shaped by so many factors I think if you break it down to smoking sticks out there comes a really clear that we've done a great John bringing down the rate in Wisconsin for Seventeen percent average\nBut if you break that up it's twenty nine percent lower income people thirty one thing I ... I'm thirty seven percent for Native American academia so we're clearly something going on here beyond individual after\nAll the time we have now I'll Annette thanks for joining us today thank you so much riding on an OB thanks for being with us\nThank you I appreciate it\nWe've been talking to ... to us from U. W. Milwaukee a public health researcher there and obey will lose or from the American Heart Association and the Wisconsin African American tobacco prevention network\nWith us to talk about a new study showing the differences in how tobacco is marketed displayed are sold in Milwaukee's minority neighborhoods versus white neighborhoods in the city\nFor the U.S postal service but exactly what the details of those arrangements are remains a bit opaque but I think in general robbed there's there's a sense\nThat the postal service has been under charging and the parcel of posts business and that in fact you know as your intro suggested or increasing rates and the parcel post business might be appropriate which I think the postal services now suggesting\nThat was one weird fundamental thing about the post office it has this mission I think even if it's in the constitution that we have to have something like that but it has a mission to deliver as you say to every address in America for a certain number of days\nBut it's supposed to be revenue neutral so which isn't the case for most government agency the department of defense doesn't have to be self sustaining why ... is that fundamental conflict part of the problem here\nYeah so so there's there's a lot packed into what you said Robyn [laughter]\nAnd you know the it's in the constitution and the Congress shall have the power you know dot dot dot to establish post offices and post roads\nAnd people you know in the east here familiar with the Boston post road and you know that all comes out of the early days in fact the post office predates the United states because back in those days the way you you quickly delivered a message was by horse post\nWhere you had a very fast writer and a fast tourists that would go from one posted the other you know handing off the bag and mailed to the next a delivery person and that was critical for national\nSecurity at the time of the revolution and then there really was a sense Rob that the the post office box was binding the nation together but what that really meant was newspaper delivery basically are from the east to the city you know towns on the frontier\nCould get a newspapers that gave readers a sense of what was going on in the country more broadly but you're referring uh their Rob also to what's called the Nineteen Seventy postal reorganization act or in the Nineteen Seventy act\nReally created in the modern U.S Postal service out of the shell of the old post office\nAnd you know the post office was like a line item and you know cabinet level position like the department of Defense Department of state that received a subsidy\nAnd the Nineteen Seventy acts said well we can't continue this way it's it's a very inefficient we're going to treat it like a utility basically where the rates are going to be set by a regulator it's still going to retain its its monopoly over delivery of letters\nBut it has to break even and that's kind of what we are living with a today Rob except for a a modification that was in two thousand five act us so it really is kind of a mixture of uh\nUh but also of of more modern laws\nIt's not going to Rick Gettys from Cornell University looking at the United States Postal service plans to increase rates proposal I should say to increase rate\nAnd the Trump Administration saying he maybe it's time we should privatize the U.S postal service let's get into that Rick what would privatize nice him look like for the postal service\nYeah so that's that's a great question Robin I I think we need to take a step back because in my experience the word privatization is actually over used it and I I think it's misused in some cases the word privatize means to actually sell ownership stakes in\nThe U.S postal service which is currently a state owned enterprises you know to private investors and some countries around the world have done this royal mail recently did this in the u._k. the German post privatized a long time ago\nLarge part of that was purchased up by da ... so it's you know it's really in the ... the HMO and the ... post ah in Germany so so that's one way to go but what I'm I think a lot of people miss\nIs actually what you suggested in your introduction which is the post the U.S postal service has billions of dollars of unfunded liabilities on its balance sheet\nAnd of course you would have to do a real careful accounting assessment to figure out exactly what that is\nBut there's no investor who is going to want to buy shares or an ownership stake in the U.S postal service unless that the tax payer picks up those are unfunded liabilities because the the ... value of the postal services negative\nAt this point and in fact in Germany when they privatized George post there was a big hit that the German taxpayers took\nIn order to be able to sell Deutch a post\nSo what I've suggested Rob a lot of others is take steps to improve the efficiency\nOf the U.S postal service but you know it's not quite ready in shape to be privatized and that includes what's called commercialization which uh deregulate said so ... you reach a reduce or eliminate those monopolies it actually has to monopolies\nOver the years of your mailbox and over the delivery of ... anything caught a lever a letter but on the other side you allow it to offer more ... more commercial freedom so new products at the rates that they choose with more flexibility in service standards and at the same time\nYou may be cut down that us so from say you know I don't I think a lot of people agree we don't need mail delivery six days per week maybe a ... we should set a minimum of say three days per week but the postal service could deliver more than that so you basically would would recognize what I think is already happened in the real world Rob\nIs that the postal service has become a fundamentally commercial service and let's get the laws and regulations to catch up with that reality\nTalking to Rick ... professor of policy analysis of management at Cornell University director of the Cornell program an infrastructure policy and visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute\nWe're talking about the postal service has proposed price hikes on forever stamps package delivery and more in the face of falling revenues you can join in and eight hundred six four to one two three four what changes do you think the postal services should make if any do you mind paying more for forever stamps if that happens\nWould you like to see some form of privatization of the postal service where would you think about less than six days a week delivering\nCalled eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four to one two three four or post on the

not really a tension grabbers and so really most people that I talked to around politics and they watch the debates they're looking for\nA gaffe is there a big moments that could live on to hunt a candidate not really the media coverage but in a media you know TV radio digital ads\nThat can be used but other than that I mean they don't expect it to be game changers and the grand scheme of things at least in the ... campaign\nI Know you can always tell is sort of thing in real time but are people talking about a moment like that at this debate where hey yeah here's something somebody just wrote the other side campaign ad\nNo not for you know looking at social media reaction and talked to ... that ... that there was something major out of this it was interesting the first debate was a week ago today and then that's what they you know leave ... there was\nClearly a more aggressive um candidate in that forum and that's probably the expected and then she's been down double digits most polls that I've seen the last month so it was remarkable to people that can be bold ones a little bit on ... ... ... ...\nAndrea dubbing of lifestyle editor for American Girl magazine and the author of the new book spark a guide to ignite the creativity inside you Andrea welcome to central time thanks for having me today what led you to want to tackle this subject try to inspire creativity for for kids girls in particular\nThe fifth yeah it was actually inspired a lot of my work with American Girl magazine I've been a lifestyle editor there for about nine years and the bulk of the content I create is creativity focus of crafts and recipes and that sort of thing so it really grew out of that experience\nAnd people might think well kids they're creative why do they need a book\nRight yeah you know I think it really depends on the age of the kid uh for me I create specifically for the male great audience which is kind of that early pre teen\nGroup and that's really the age where kids are getting more um self conscious and kind of experiencing more of the inner credit I think he would call it when it comes to topics like creativity so this book is really I'm kind of helping them at face and there could have development\nYeah there's a I've I've seen studies of big changes of what kind of what you're talking about here are just looking for eight plus plus okay so that's when you start to see in studies or interest in science and technology changing a interest in different kinds of arts changing a lot of different things but this is kind of a key a turning point in some ways it is yet\nSo take us through now spark and how you try to spark their creativity\nYeah well I'm the book really opens with defining creativity and it was really important for me in the book itself to cast a really broad definition of what creativity yes\nIn a really narrow way especially with kids um if they're not artistic or draw or you know painter right they don't often think they're creative so from the gecko in the book I really try to define creativity very broadly to cover a lot of different disciplines um and then after that I kind of go into the creative process itself\nThrough a force that process up a kind of lay out throughout the book there give us the overview of that process yeah the overview of the four main steps that I cover our make tanker a nephew's mean imagine make tanker finish\nAnd um that really is taking kids from the IDF face um and then bringing them through kind of what the rough draft phase\nThe ... the styling or the kind of um refining phase and then finishing it and send in the idea on to the world\nI Want to talk about the refining say is what I Love you talk about a kind of a scientific method for creativity can you give you a dig into that a little more\nRight yeah you know the scientific method is in here um if the the child is actually dealing with the craving a creative idea that relates to 'em that sort of discipline um to create a method here for kind of more general creativity um has to do with getting feedback\nAnd I'm dealing with discouragement and that sort of thing um so from a creative from a general perspective uh that's what kind of the book goes into\nTalking to Andrea dubbing all through the new book spark a guide to ignite the creativity inside you are helping to a spark and get a little method an inspiration especially to young girls and help them be creative in in different phases of life\nAnd you got to give some role models or early on all women who who could inspire creativity and again not just you know painting and what we think of as art and creativity\nRight um there's a section of the book that deals with women from throughout history so women in the past but also women who are still around and creating today and then I also pulled in some words from women who weren't necessarily famous but they are out in the world today creating in some capacity um and I thought it was important to have\nMany different women represented in this book again to kind of show the broader range of what it means to be creative and the different ways that that can play out in a person's life\nAnd to a piece of the book that I really like is dealing with a criticism and discouraging when you talked about the inner critic their outer critics to talk about how you are you talk to younger girls about getting feedback getting positive feedback and how to deal with the less useful stuff\nRight yeah so for the feedback portion of it um I give girls like three different criteria that they should use when evaluating feedback from other people um and the first is really 'em knowing that you don't have to get feedback from every one that to be selective about the feedback\nI'm also asking good questions when you're getting feedback about your work not just is this good but ah you know questions that could maybe help um refined the work of it and then the third step would be um to decide whether or not to use the feedback\nBecause just because someone makes a comment about the work you're creating doesn't mean you have to use it and that's that's the part that's in the book to\nAnd then as far as the the criticism and the discouragement um that would be feedback that comes from people that's not helpful or as mean spirited and there's a section in the book that talks about that too and it\nFlips around to it but it's kind of guidance on how to do good feedback right yeah can you talk about how we can think of the feedback we might deliver to people even if we're you know forty eight year old male Sadat and not just a middle school girls\nRight yeah there's a section in the book that um I called creative critique and it's really taking the reader through the process of like you said giving good feedback on creative work I'm the first is just really to observe and describe what you're seeing you know if you're evaluating someone else's creative work I'm the second would be seeing the good in it and pulling out\nSure one or two of the exercises that but somebody might be able to try it home\nYeah um let me just look through here quick um there is a couple of pages that I called brain breaks and those are totally just for fun pages where it's not connected to any sort of created activity um but the brain break for instance has um pictures of\n'em made up animals and birds and flowers and that sorts of things and then they readers encouraged to just brainstorm a name\nFor those um and then in the next page it's kind of the opposite where we give you a name like Blair you've learnt cake is something that's I'm In the book or a gadget called is is all that and then the reader has to do it all that and kind of come up with okay what would this look like if this was a real thing that existed and to\nBoth in your work at American Girl magazine and then in response you've had so far from the book what kind of things do you hear from girls in this age range and they talk about creativity and maybe things that have that have helped them re embrace it\nYeah um I think you know one thing I've heard and this was at some events that have done for the the books launch is just um and appreciation for encouraging\nA broader view of creativity because I'm I've seen all sorts of kids that that come to a these events but um I think one thing I heard is as kids who didn't necessarily think they are creative when they see the thing that they like to do like robotics are solving equations or something in the book\nIt's helped them realize oh I Am creative because you know I I enjoy um things that are in here that I'm actually talking about relation to creativity so looking\nIn your book it's like that's the big win for you when you add for my kid yet I didn't know ours creative what I Am yes yep\nAnd we hear a often now from the business community a skill or we've talked about this on the show a skill that they're looking for and employees is creativity and not necessarily yeah we want people come in and do fabulous portraits for us but our creative thinking are you a are you selling this in part to uh teachers parents and kids as well this could actually help you and your career\nDown the road I absolutely I honestly wrote this for adults as much as I read it for kids and I've\nHad a lot of um adults that have actually read the book and said you know I Know I'm not in your age group for this but I totally love it and I got a lot of great things out of out of it and to be honest I still get things from this book because the things that I wrote are things that I Need to be reminded of too so I think I'm no matter where you're at or what age you are if this could be helpful book for you\nYeah I was going to ask do you find the lessons you've you know the creativity you put into making the book inspiring you to to try to think creatively now that you're done with\nThat I Do absolutely um there are times that I find myself rereading parts of it and thinking oh I should probably put that into practice more\nNow are there are probably more parents and teachers listening right now than actual eight year old so I'll be honest with you so I can you leave us with a message for those parents and teachers to not let that creativity go away as a kid's head up or elementary and middle school\nYeah I Would just again as I said I'm to encourage their child to have a broader view of creativity and to not be discouraged by um things they make not turning out the first time you know understanding that creativity is a process and that part of that process is failure in practice and getting better over time\nOr even their Andrea thanks a lot for joining us today thank you Andrea dubbing of lifestyle editor for American Girl magazine she's the author of the new book we've been talking about spark a guide to ignite the creativity inside you\nLove to hear from you have you maintained or maybe re ignited creativity at some stage in your life tell us what you did how you did it and how it's working for you you can email ideas that WPRI dot org\nOr you can always tweet us at Central time WPRI be as creative as you want coming up we'll trace of his\nWith inequality at that time which was a you know this is right after the um the boom of the Nineteen twenties and after the gilded age of the eighties nineties afraid started to to take hold they were saying they were looking at\nSimilar kinds of inequality that we're looking at now and they said that there so there was this new thing called multimillionaire which they looked at sort of as we might look at billionaires or you know or or you know kind of ... beans off level of wealth right is this going to start a new level of wealth\nAnd they said if we let people get this kind of private wells that will be the end of the American dream because the American dream is about equality and opportunity for all not just because of the few and so they were using the American dream to hearken back\nTo those you know found the founding principles about liberty justice opportunity for all and indeed quality and arguing that inequality would destroy those American Dream and so the American dream was um coins really to advocate\nFor principles of social justice against free market capitalism and of course now it's farm often use the other way around to argue that free market capitalism is what will enable individuals to rise but a hundred years ago there was facing exactly\nThe same problem in fact to the extent that they coins the expression the metaphor of the one percent in the Ninety nine percent because they were looking at the same inequality so they also talked about\nHow one percent of the nation was was controlling you know the vast majority of the wealth and Ninety nine percent of the country was left behind and they said in order to fight that\nKind of inequality we need to we need to figure out how to how to control capitalism so that we can protect the American dream of democracy or the quality of\nAll through the new book behold America the untangle history of America First and the American dream so when does the American dream slip to mean not exactly the opposite of what you were just talking about bringing most ...\nPretty close capital takes the opposite side of the debate right so there there's a debate about whether whether the country is better off with um with you know kind of individual private wealth of individual aspiration and and and\nEventually the argument saying that only free market totally free market capitalism would enable that kind of aspiration and prosperity and then the arguments that actually you you will do better as a society if you protect collective uh quality and and protect opportunity for\nAll until it switched sides in the same for the debate remain fame but the American dream which pots and\nI'm not happened after the second World War so that\nHappened when consumer capitalism really took off when the post war boom took off and and the idea of started to spread that um that puts more prosperity really could be had by all and that that there could be kind of you can ... that the nation could habits cake and eat it basically that you could have vast private wealth kind of for everybody um\nAnd and in particular that consumerism is what will deliver that an and one of the kind of moments of of where we can mark that pay that is when Harry Truman in Nineteen forty seven said that freedom of enterprise was you know kind of an ... American right\nAnd and a lot of us probably think I Know I did that the notion of freedom of enterprises afraid is much older than that but it was actually\nFrom Nineteen forty seven and ... and at that point it's sort of it it helps\nKind of I always think of the American dream it's as if it's\nIf it's about a debate between kind of justice and liberty and at that point it started to kind of really took onto the scales and in in favor of kind of liberty portions of individual liberty and individual rights to pursue what you wanted to do um and to be ... increasingly\nLess concerned with classrooms of social justice and collective wellbeing\nAnd let's turn to the other phrase America First this is a phrase that President Trump views on Donald Trump and his campaign and people said oh you have to go back and look up to its origins in the Nineteen thirties or Nineteen forties we're right hold on to goes back further than that you talk about\nAh when America First was first used in America\nAbsolutely it is a much older praise and I think that that\nUm the that earlier period again is instructed that it it teaches us more about\nWhat Americans have been arguing about and why I'm so I'm America First the earliest traces I've found that are from the Eighteen eighties actually\nAs a Republican slogan although of course as we all know the Republican Party in the Eighteen eighties you know it is a far cry from the Republican Party day in the same goes for Democrats parties you know their identities have shifted a lot but nonetheless it was Republican slogan it didn't become popularized until just a Woodrow Wilson used it in Nineteen Fifteen\nI'm an adult people today talk a lot about it as a phrase that was used to keep us out of the second World War as you said you know in in the thirties and I'm Nineteen forty forty one in particular but actually it it became popular as a way to talk about keeping us out of the first\nWorld War ... of the Wilson didn't use it quite in the sense that it rapidly got taken up in the name of kind of pure isolationism let in Europe solve their own problems it's not our issue um so we need to put America First and\nUm you know and and and think about our domestic problems um and it became associated very quickly with protection is Tara and\nUm and indeed without the debates about whether America she joined the league of nations um a lot of people were very suspicious of a lot of Americans were suspicious that the treaty of Versailles within tangle off in kind of European conflicts and put the two a day\nAnd they and they argued strenuously that we needed to put America First and not and not be kind of ...\nConflicts going forward and said that was in the argument that kept us out of the league of nations and then Warren Harding ran on America First in Nineteen twenty and try to pass a permanent\nProtectionist tariff which is a little forgotten that if history I don't really I mean he wanted to pass that in perpetuity so that we would always have a protectionist tariff\nOn the teapot dome scandal put an end to that and then in Nineteen twenty four Calvin Coolidge who also ran on in America first focus I mean it was incredibly popular in the court is it's a it's a really prominent part of the political conversation in the twenties um\nAnd Calvin Coolidge passed a sweeping immigration a rather signed into law a sweeping immigration reform act\nIn Nineteen twenty four called the national origins act which is a pretty Tori is\nI'm In uh immigration law that that had on and I could really strict quotas really ruthless quotas on the basis\nOf people's ethnicity and the nations of origin and it's a pretty clearly genesis law I'm trying to keep a immigrant population I'm from northern Europe and to enter with loosely restrict them from other parts of the world on\nOutlaw was debated on the floor of Congress in the name of America First and it was passed and the name was America First\nSo the kinds of of um political ideas that we now associate with a with the Trump Administration has a on a much older history um I think\nAs important as that is so that the more important part is part that's the last five which is not only that America First was a very popular slogan with the when they sent Ku Klux Klan\nAt that time and they were in the march repeatedly with banners saying that they were for America first that you know with parades and what have you got advertisements saying that they were America's only society that was for America first\nAnd they were very explicitly in the Nineteen twenties you know they they didn't make any bones about the fact that they were white supremacist organization\nAnd will pick up on that point in just a few moments Sarah church well is with us all

were coming up a new report finds that tobacco marketing as being targeted targeted at minority communities in Milwaukee will break down what they found coming up\nFirst the Centers for Disease Control and prevention released a report last week on vaccination rates in each state according to that report Wisconsin kindergarten students are getting exempted from getting vaccines at a higher rate than the national average\nAcross much of the country a little more than two percent of kindergartners go without vaccinations in Wisconsin that number is just over five percent\nDr Joseph McBride as a practicing physician who specializes in infectious diseases he's part of you W school of medicine and public health\nDr McBride thanks a lot for coming up to the studio thanks so much for having me well what's your reaction now when you see these numbers yeah it's uh certainly it's surprising to see such high numbers here in Wisconsin we really value our health and our health of our community\nAnd I think we value public health at a high amount\nUm and to see these numbers as high as they are especially compared to other states throughout the country\nIs a surprising trend that we'd like to reverse that we see a number like a five percent getting these exemptions from vaccines\nFlipping around Ninety five percent are getting vaccine that sounds like a lot what's the threshold for when we get worried when there's too many unvaccinated kid yeah great question so usually under the around Ninety to Ninety five percent is when we start to worry\nCertainly once we get below Ninety percent that's when the big concern happens\nObviously with the concept of herd immunity the hired one hundred percent that you can get the better um so I don't think we're necessarily in panic mode at this point but there are certainly as areas for improvement\nWhat do we know about long term trends I Know there's different ways of measuring even in this report from state to state so it it might be hard to compare apples to apples but what do we know about how things have changed in Wisconsin well what can we can say at least the last couple of years when this study was\nBeen a lot of changes over the last twenty four months or so so it seems that the exit exemption rate that people are are having for vaccinations has remained constant over the last few years and\nWithout a lot of changes in legislature or our public health policies I don't necessarily foresee a big change in that\nLet's talk about these exemptions there's a couple of reasons kids can knock it vaccine some there are medical reasons ah where a vaccine might be unhealthy for them that's a smaller part of it it sounds like more of them are done under a rubric of like philosophical objections to vaccines right yeah so\nI'm just to put things in perspective a little bit we had a little bit over sixty six thousand a kindergartners in Wisconsin starts school last year and looking at the numbers of exemptions we had about one hundred and sixty four a medical exemptions and this can be a wide range of medical problems\nUh for things that encompass immune deficiencies and people maybe people who are going through chemotherapy for cancers um or people who have true allergies to a vaccine\nUm but then in Wisconsin we have to other forms of exemptions\nAnd over you this is new research I'm guessing it's not surprising research are from the work you're doing so\nIt's not surprising um and when you look at the history of the back of an art in African Americans within the industry it has a historical ... that go far back beyond that even though when I was born\nAnd you know during World War two the industry marketed to the military servicemen are products as cigarettes were viewed as a ... ... ... the little guy because of that um but in perhaps\nThat became addicted to tobacco products um during that time within like who who cleared the annual income African American increased threefold from three very little more Nintendo and making the pot a population and the bigger and increasingly appealing demographic or the tobacco industry\nAnd can you talk about the impact of tobacco today in minority communities here in Wisconsin and beyond yes\nUm there's ... no ... well I'm an African Americans are targeted I'm way more than their counterparts in regards to cigarettes specifically menthol cigarettes because there's an easier way to become addicted to them to take\n'em in the ... isn't as harsh as regular cigarette I'm sort of the marketing within the industry they carved at them to these populations on one because there is a consumer base there who there's a lack of knowledge and awareness education around the menthol cigarettes as well\nAnd when they are used kind of a a tool kit as you say this kind of research has been done in other communities around the country can you talk about how that works and and how Milwaukee stacks up next to some other cities that might have been new research in the past\nBut we use is called the stars tool so it's it's really available online source to standardize tobacco assessment for retail settings and it will develop by the CDC and MCI and some other federal and state groups\nAnd so we had people go out into the stores and it's basically a checklist and so it's called a store bought it and you know you got to pay how much are cigarettes here\nWhere the cigarettes placed is their mental advertising stuff like that um and so you know unfortunately I Would say that our findings put us up there with\nYou know the the cities where this is the struggling feeding articulate um it's really not good news um to put it frankly what we are really seeing really strong targeting of these populations in the same way that you would see no other major cities in the U.S\nAnd a stark difference you right in the report between ah the more white primarily white ZIP Code you looked at versus the minority ones that are pretty big difference how does that\nGive you one example um the the little small cigars for less than a dollar so you're really affordable tobacco product eighty one per cent stores in the African American neighborhoods were doing this compared to just about fifty percent into white neighborhoods\nAnd uh how about the marketing for kids how how much more prevalent was that as you say the cigarettes mix of the candy say in the African American neighborhoods versus the white neighborhood\nYeah the cigarettes next to candy was just I found that in five per cent stores into white neighborhoods compared to forty two percent of African American neighborhoods [noise]\nAnd obey can you talk about that especially the angle of a tobacco products being placed ... the marketing towards kids in minority neighborhoods in particular was\nOver you there yeah I'm here okay so there was there for there's definitely a use of\nDifferent ways of customers to come at a specially um\nYoungsters battle company whose price ... promotions for one such as good as the most I packed coupons\nAnd brain and give like such a T shirts lighters and other books printed on even utilizing candy as the use of advertisements to get the youngsters by tobacco products um attracting low income and it was such a popular and customers are limited also looking I'm a walk more closely\nOn the promotion might involve received like there are parts of the one item um involving\nUm good things about ... including soaked cynical was allowing the suburbs require those parties who are even from time to the same promotion for the wrong people owned by even giving away free old\nSock it an OB will lose or what the American Heart association\nTo network and ... would you be Milwaukee public health researcher their co author of a new study finding tobacco products targeted more strongly in minority neighborhoods in Milwaukee\nOh you've been working on these issues on on prevention of tobacco use among African American what kind of changes would you like to see [noise]\nI Would like us really hone in on\nThe products and the little bully flavored tobacco products now these are the solutions that with the American Heart Association and primarily the Wisconsin African American tobacco prevention network that we're looking to really hold on this issue\nUm and ... of products from other states that he's in a list of ... because they've done this and other areas some working so old uncle ... to ... like a others as well as I look out for about ...\nA lead to lose condensed and bought a young student individually cleaning um restrict product placement\nSo they're not at all levels of all it's all about because we didn't see that there are about Coby teleconference so the end of the of Milwaukee then restrict tobacco so some you know schools carts and sort of organizations rules regulations on policies that around like I'm\nHaving a lot more going on for the carry on that should be at the state of the rounds of holds for Quebec all products\nAnd when they are when other cities have this kind of research do you have there been changes like OB was talking about a regulation on some of the things we're talking about how where or how much tobacco products are marketed\nYeah the other the definitely made strides hertz so our neighbor Chicago for example have banned the sale of flavored tobacco including menthol\nWithin a five hundred feet at schools which you know is a logical thing to do given that these ... are really targeting young people the problem Milwaukee has is that we will almost certainly can't do that because a lot of tobacco with preempted by the state so a lot of these\nThings that could be done locally we can't do here because their state powers in Wisconsin\nAnd obey argue reaching out to the stores are chains of stores directly or in addition to pushing for regulation\nCorrect the Wisconsin African American tobacco prevention network has multiple committees are ... dealing with the housing smoking and housing and that just ends up on all policy around most smoke housing\n'em and then also you have a group that deals with single cigarette smoking 'cause that's also a problem\nI'm aware all companies are going to allow outside of a package of ... in home loan that will really getting them to understand that this is not allowed to watch movies\nAnd when they do what do we know about so when kids are exposed to tobacco products on their marketed to them how much of an impact that has been smoking as teams for example and beyond\nThat we do know that the more children are exposed to tobacco in the store environment as kids the more likely the artist start smoking as adolescence we also know that for adults who want to quit smoking it makes it harder if you go to a store and you're just bombarded with tobacco advertising so there's a whole real life span effect of this advertising\nAnd obey uh you've been working on this issue for awhile yourself I is this report or are you hoping this report is a wakeup call for for some kind of action on tobacco marketing\nYes Beth and I'm hoping that the community and you can start cities are more aware of it is one thing to do the research and there's one thing that we have to also go out and educate the masters and to see how they'd never this is a problem within their communities and our retailers are particularly the fans they're targeting their health and social ...\nFollows the systems that environment has has around this issue for them and they can say that the Senate is individuals law for ... and ...\nAnd Lenny I just mentioned the social determinants of smoking and I think a lot of times people think of tobacco use as an individual decision a choice someone makes how important is it in prevention to think about\nYou know the design of where smoking is marketed where are you just said they'll lay out of a community or even determining who's going to smoke and who doesn't\nUsually I mean ultimately we were able to do what they are shaped by so many factors\nI think if you break it down there's no case to think that it can be really clear\nThat we've done a great John bringing down the rate and Wisconsin average but if you break that up it's twenty nine percent lower income people thirty one and thirty seven percent for an academic so we're clearly something going on here beyond that they will\nSolve a time we have now I'll Annette thanks for joining us today and will be thanks for being with us thank you I appreciate it we've been talking\nTo ... from U. W. Milwaukee a public health researcher there and obey will booze or from the American Heart Association and the Wisconsin African American tobacco prevention network\nThere with us to talk about a new study showing the differences in how tobacco is marketed displayed a sold in Milwaukee's minority neighborhoods that versus white neighborhood in the city\nOur remains a bit opaque\nBut I think in general Rob there's there's a sense that the postal service has been under charging and the parcel of posts business and that in fact you know as your intro suggested or increasing rates and the partial post business might be appropriate which I think the postal service has now suggesting\nThat was one weird fundamental thing about the top of it has this mission I think even if it's in the constitution that we have to have something like that but it has this mission to deliver as you say to every address in America for a certain number of days\nUp but it's supposed to be revenue neutral so ... which isn't the case for most government agency the department of defense doesn't have to be self sustaining why ... ... is that fundamental conflict part of the problem here\nYeah so so there's there's a lot packed into what you said Rob [laughter] and uh you know it's in the constitution\nAnd the Congress shall have the power I you know dot dot dot to establish post offices and posts roads and people you know in the east here familiar with the Boston post road and you know that all comes out of the early days in fact the post office predates the United states\nBecause back in those days the way you you quickly delivered a message was by horse post where you had a very fast writer and a fast tourists that would go from one posted the other you know handing off the bag a male to the next a delivery person\nAnd that was critical for national security at the time of the revolution\nAnd then there really was a sense Rob that the the post office box was binding the nation together but what that really meant was newspaper delivery basically from the east of the city you know towns on the frontier could get a newspapers that gave readers a sense of what was going on in the country more broadly\nBut you're referring uh their Rob also to what's called the Nineteen Seventy postal reorganization act or in the Nineteen Seventy act really created in the modern U.S Postal service\nOut of the shell of the old post office and you know the post office was like a line item and you know cabinet level position\nLike the department of Defense Department of state that received a subsidy and the Nineteen Seventy acts said well we can't continue this way it's it's a very an official we're going to treat it like a utility basically where the rates are going to be set by a regulator\nIt's still going to retain its its monopoly over delivery of letters but it has to break even\nAnd that's kind of what we're living with a today Rob except for a a modification that was in two thousand five act or so it really is kind of a mixture of of history of the United states but also of of more modern laws\nIt's not going to Rick ... from Cornell University looking at the United States Postal service plans to increase rates proposal I should say to increase rate and the Trump Administration saying he maybe it's time we should privatize the U.S postal service let's get into that Rick what would privatize nice him look like for the postal service\nYeah so that's that's a great question Robin I I think we need to take a step back because in my experience the word privatization is actually over used it and I think it's misused in some cases the word privatized means to actually sell ownership stakes in\nThe U.S postal service which is currently a state owned enterprises\nYou know to private investors and some countries around the world have done this royal mail recently did this in the u._k. the German post privatized a long time ago large part of that was purchased up by da ... so it's you know it's really in the ... the HMO and the ... posed\nA in Germany so so that's one way to go but what\nThis is actually what you suggested in your introduction which is the post the U.S postal service has billions of dollars of unfunded liabilities on its balance sheet\nAnd of course you would have to do a real careful accounting assessment to figure out exactly what that is but there is no investor who is going to want to buy shares or an ownership stake in the U.S postal service unless that the taxpayer picks up those are unfunded liabilities because the net value\nOf the postal services negative at this point and in fact in Germany when they privatized George post there was a big hit the German taxpayers took in order to be able to sell ... post\nSo what I've suggested Rob a lot of others is take steps to improve the efficiency of the U.S postal service but you know it's not quite ready\nIn shape to be privatized and that includes what's called commercialization which are deregulate fit\nSo ... you reach a reduce or eliminate those monopolies it actually has to monopolies over the years severe mailbox and over the delivery of anything called deliver a letter but on the other side\nYou allow it to offer more ... more commercial freedom so new products at the rates if they choose with more flexibility in service standards\nAnd at the same time you may be cut down that us show from say you know I don't I think a lot of people agree we don't need mail delivery six days per week maybe a ... we should set a minimum of say three days per week but the postal service could deliver more than that so you basically would would recognize what I think it's already happened to the real world Rob\nIs that the postal service has become a fundamentally commercial service and let's get the laws and regulations to catch up with that reality\nTalking to Rick ... professor of policy analysis of management at Cornell University director of the Cornell program and infrastructure policy and visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute\nWe're talking about the postal service has proposed price hikes on forever stamps package delivery and more in the face of falling revenues you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four what changes do you think the postal services should make if any do you mind paying more for forever stamps if that happens\nWould you like to see some form of privatization of the postal service what would you think about less than six days a week
