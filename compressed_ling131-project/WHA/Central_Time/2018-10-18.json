is one of the world's most famous chef Santa public TV fame Britain coming up so join us in our studio to talk about some of the biggest challenges we can run into when we're cooking and\nHow to solve them now Governor Walker requested approval from the federal government last year to put rules in place that would make some work mandatory for able bodied Medicaid recipients here in the state it was an issue Governor Walker worked on for years and seemingly have the support of many in his base an from members of the Trump Administration\nBut the rollout of the new rules has been slow with some political watchers wondering if a tough campaign season might be playing a role\nOur next guest has been following this topic and it's here to talk about the role healthcare is playing in election bids in Wisconsin and around the country Dan diamond is the author of political pulse\nDan welcome to central time\nMy pleasure to be here up\nWe'll talk us through the timeline this has been out there for a while these Medicaid work requirements back Wisconsin is asking for how long has this been going on\nThis has been going on since essentially the beginning of the Trump administration's hooked hold back a second and I'll tell you how I came to the story and the national picture\nWisconsin is one of about a dozen states that have asked the Trump Administration for permission to impose work ... on Medicaid beneficiaries and make other changes that could really hurt low income Americans and Governor Scott Walker specifically wanted to drug test\nMedicaid beneficiaries but she pushed for other programs in Wisconsin too\nAs well as require copayments now in some states these requests have been approved and I'd heard a few months ago that Wisconsin's approval was basically done to there was a story I ruined August that broke some news about is that Governor Walker's drug test\nA request was was gained and permissible that there would be a workaround instead for that and many of the other changes that he wanted to get to sign off\nAs I've been waiting for the announcement and and even as the Trump administration's top medicate official publicly accused of a few weeks ago what I've been hearing from the folks inside the administration is that Wisconsin was suddenly acting\nOdd and and less interested in this waiver then and they had then or yours is one person told me it was kind of a hurry up and wait we want this done and now that it's done a Wisconsin was was being very ... picky and creating reasons to stall\nTo be fair to the ... a Walker administration they deny that they're stalling they said that they've done everything that the Trump Administration will launch and they're blaming the hold up on officials here in in ... see I think the bigger issue is that Walker like many Republicans around the country is vulnerable and health care issues and and you saw some of that this week in Wisconsin as ... campaign\nReally him on preexisting conditions\nSo at this point just a few weeks out from an election where a Democrat and they will take over the state house in Wisconsin and and there's Medicaid waiver that Walker wanted they may never get put into law there there's a lot of\nMystery around why has it taken so long and and does the Walker administration even walk this way to have an election\nAnd author of a lot of books the newest one is my American Dream a life of love family and food Lydia welcome back to central time when John ... well thank you so much for coming over to the studio today now\nYou've been out this for a while you've been cooking for a long time\nYes I've been cooking for forty seven years and I've been on public television for Twenty years right is it still possible\nFor even for you to find something new a new challenge or a new wrinkle in the kitchen all the time\nBut that's the excitement you know and being I think in any business if you cannot be challenged by something new and continue to grow and then ultimately share it then I I think you know it's sort of a fizzles off\nSo you know what are my challenge is certainly a I Love the the seasons and there's always something new with the season and you know you're talking about cooking and I would recommend to stick with the seasons are the products of the seasons are up their best usually most of the comical and yield a good meal\nAnd we're going to be talking actually got a food segment tomorrow about cooking with winter squash very seasonal right now and actually one of my colleagues uh made one of your uh winter squash recipes is amazing thing with I think it was cider vinegar what are some of your favorite ways to use winter squash\nThe endless you know when discussion of course there's many different I think also out there in the kitchen don't just say with the with the butternut squash but there's so many the acorn there's so many different squash and they all are a little bit unique you know they're the same that nice Pompeo orange and yellow we are\nAs a kind of a texture and delicious this but they do have some are more ... some of that\nSo from soups from from appetizers you know whether you roasted you grill it your marinated in in a in a ... vinegar kind of a a\n... and then you grill it\nTo soups making pasta I Love making you know part of the cost of this you know everybody's concerned about eating a lot of carbohydrates add more\nVegetables more proteins and more squash squash and and and Trump's go fantastically well you know so making a nice sauce or pasta then of course as a side dish\nUh for for a main course roast ... ah squashed puree it just endless even desert\nNow there are a lot of things I Will cook and I'm happy to cook in the world and then I think I probably like a lot of home cooks there is something that scare me that I'm going to waste the money on this and I'm going to get it all wrong and it's going to be terrible I give us a pep talk for taking on those challenges well Rob\nIf you begin with I'm going to do it all wrong then you go back you gotta do you know what I'm going to be challenged by this guy and of course I think what's what you do some diligent research in her look up\nReading a little bit on the subject let's say that you want to cook ... and I used to cooking Colorado will read up on it you know ... you need to know how to clean it which is somewhat of a challenge but they sell now beautiful color muddy clean frozen fresh frozen and it's perfectly fine\nAnd and then you begin on cooking you know what's very important especially with fish is temperature do I cook it a lot to echo could little delayed under cooking so that kinda money is you either cook it quick and fast or you cook it very long to get the sauce so you know once you're you're kind of ...\nIt and you know what Rob doesn't always come the best the first time you have to try to over and over again\nIt's funny you went to see what in fact that's exactly what I was thinking about when I get it wrong\nI imagine that kind of you know ... ... ... people are kind of a curious about them because they are you know ... out there this is the food of the day but yet to cook it at home they have a little difficulties\nNow you're famous of course for Italian cooking how do you approach maybe other types of cuisines and look for elements that you can bring in and add to your own\nTalent well you know I Am kind of wedded to the Italian color memory tradition\nAnd that is because I came to the United states as an immigrant or twelve was born in Italy so very much Italian still at home you know with my mother was Ninety eight still alive\nAnd we ... we speak Italian was dialect so but then be in trouble and coming to America I adopted America you know I I'm an American and so how do you communicate and to my gift has been I guess to communicate to the food I bring my\nA native of a culture of food and the the Italian into the American so therefore I Try to respect us much as possible what's really truly happening in in Italy so that I communicate that in my book so my show\nOr in my restaurant but I Can't say that you know I don't experiment you know ginger lemon grass lie put these in the Italians I don't put my restaurants or in my in the books but I Do play with them at home\nTalking to shop Lydia ... she's in the studio with us here in Wisconsin or latest book or what if money is my American Dream a life of love family and food last time you were on with us we talked about uh my American Dream now you're going around the country talking to people about it\nOr are you hearing a lot of people maybe were distorted really hits home with them they've had similar experiences\nIt does he that's because it's my story the you know the the ... real ah Lydia immigrant story so I Am an immigrant and not only a refugee on refugee we we well let me just kind of summarize that I come from a poor part of Italy north east of and\nThat was a time in after World War two deadly lost the war and that part is the the peninsula was given to the newly formed communist Yugoslavia and we were caught behind communism\nAre ultimately was difficult who couldn't speak the Italian but couldn't practice our religion my parents decided that you know we needed to get out of their escape back into Italy\nAnd when we were back into Italy you know it's difficult settling we we actually spent two years in the political refugee camp and ultimately were were brought here but the Catholic Relief services\nAnd at that time like Eisenhower was the president and he opened immigration for people fleeing communism that's how we came and that's the story that's but beyond that you know the book is a\nA I think you know growing up as a young girl and with grandma and grandpa had all the court you are to animals where my passion for food really came where was born I was actually in the those formative years with grandma on the farm with the animals milk in the goats picking\nThe potatoes and all of that that my passion for food was started\nAnd when you talk about food only write about food it's never just food it's family it's culture it's traditions that you you don't cook without\nUp food doesn't stand alone you know food needs a table and needs people around the table to appreciate it\nAnd enjoy it food nurtures us keeps us alive and it's a way of telling somebody you know I mean for me it's great pleasure cooking I feel I nurture people I I you know I make them happy again\nIt makes me very happy to see people enjoyed the food\nNow you've changed my cooking I think the first time I talk to you you talked about a saving a the scraps and freezing the bread in the freezer and the water from the past I Do that at this point my wife has stopped making fun of me for having freezers full of these scraps at any other tips like that any other things you like to save don't waste it using another way you\nKnow you know Rob I think that a common sense is sometimes overlook and people just say oh I Can't cook I Can't do that but I think in the kitchen really think focus on common sense\nAnd you know what is it are you feeling that the carrots let's say you on the carrot you wash that are you feeling appeals to you throw it away well if you wash them\nThey're they're good you freeze them with that with the celery leaves them whatever next time you make soup you pull it all out you put it in the pot with the chicken bones and you've got yourself a great soup\nAll right I Will and I'm guilty I throw away I compost compost I'm currently all day but I'll I'll start using those to God so what you're going to be talking I at the book festival you're talking about your book here in Wisconsin what uh what kind of stories or you're bringing\nTo well you know it's going to be like an intimate conversation with Libya so I Will tell them a little bit about this story intro my because they all know Lydia the chefs\nThat they're they're so what's the lady as real lifelike and so and they're surprised because you know they think that you know you you sort of a I got it became a chef and this was the big success but there was a whole a truck to it and then ultimately once I attended will open it up to questions and see what the audience would like so it's a give and take\nNow this fall it's comfort food season especially coming into winter what is Libya's comfort food what do you eat when you need that that warm sustaining nourishing thing\nWell I Love pasta but soup salsa and this is a soup time and so now it's mushroom and nice mushroom soup with barley you know what I put in there some chestnuts to very much and not chest nuts with mushroom and barley fantastic\nAnd you know you sort of kind of it really is mellowed caress as you as you eat it and that's a great thing that you can make a big part and then you freeze it and then you know it's sort of keeps him giving\nI've never cooked with chest hurts you roast them first or how do they go into the soup\nWhile yes you need to either roast them or boil them and then you peel them and then you need to kind of kept about because they sort of a mellow into the soup and they remain remain like little pieces like beans\nMushrooms barley and chest not soup that does sound comforting this time of year they go Lydia thank you so much for joining us today I appreciate it that's it\nAll that we hear about the opioid epidemic\nAlcohol still is the number one problem ... most people have a mild or moderate problem not a severe problem and if you get this independent assessment with somebody who is not tied\nTo a rehab who does not have a personal investment that's the best way to go about it because they can tell you how severe your problem is and whether or not you need to go to an outpatient program\nWhich is really where about nine out of ten people wind up and one outta ten people end up in a rehab and they're really meant for the most severe cases\nMight strike people as difficult or unusual to be in effect shopping for addiction treatment but it sounds like you're saying that's part of what we should be doing in addition to getting back to the referral also looking at the various options and figure out what they offered picking and choosing the extent that we\nExactly what people should be doing one of the experts\nWho I interviewed and who helped me with a book is Dr Thomas McClellan and he said I'm most people spend more time shopping for a vacuum cleaner or a washing machine\nThen they do looking for addiction treatment and um you know that's a pretty sad state of affairs I'm about to have back surgery and I consulted several experts before I decided who was going to put a knife in my back but we don't think that way we panic\nAnd most people I mean there are people who are about to die from substance use disorder and you need to get them help quickly and sometimes we often what people do is they turn to their neighbor they turn to somebody they know\nUm they turned to their doctor and many I Would say venture to say most physicians\nReally don't know a whole heck of a lot about addiction treatment um most of us when we have a problem can take some time\nIt doesn't matter if you wait a few weeks or even a month um to take time to find an expert in their community I can think of several and my relatively small university town where you you go to this expert who can give you an independent assessment\nOf what you and maybe that person turns out to be the person who you can ... who you end up seeing um who can council you one on one because if you go to treatment whether it's an out patient program or a very fancy rehab you're going to end up in groups um some\nOf the most prestigious programs that I went to people were in group treatment I figured out about eight hours out of a fist\nIf I were going to send one of my young adult kids to spend thirty thousand dollars on rehab I wouldn't never has gas that eight hours of that Fifteen hour a day we're going to be in group treatment and that's excluding lunch and\nMeditation groups but that that really floored me\nTalking to an ... her new book is inside rehab the Surprising Truth about addiction treatment and how to get help that works\nAnd there's this uh obituary from the Burlington free press and Vermont that's that's gone viral it's written by the mother of a young woman who died of an addiction and and I want to quote just one bit of it very relevant to your your book quoting here if you work in one of the many institutions through which addicts often passed rehab hospital jails courts\nAnd treat them with the compassionate respect they deserve thank you\nIf instead you see a junkie or the liar in front of you rather than a human being in need of help consider a new profession\nSo as you look to rehab centers and the other options out there\nWhat attitude did you see\nUs in terms of the which side of that fence people were on well it\nIt it depends um I found some of the facilities\nThat I went to war using terminology like all addicts are the same I'm using terms like junkies and if you like somebody that junkie people you need to understand that this is a disorder there's controversy\nAbout whether you want to call it whether it's a disease\nEven though most professional organizations feel that it's a disease I feel like let's not waste time arguing about what it is\nIt is by the time somebody has a severe use disorder it I I feel it's a disease and it takes hold and it's all the person can think about let's treated with respect and recognize it that way it's controlling a person's life at\nThat point and to use pejorative language I'm like junkie um even clean somebody's clean I cringe every time I hear somebody say he's clean and sober\nUm or he has a dirty urine he had a dirty urine that suggests that when you say somebody's clean it\nSuggests that they were dirty when they were using we would never say that about somebody with diabetes um when they have a positive urine test we need to stop and fight against the stigma\nThat I'm with which addiction people with addiction are treated I ... I never refer to somebody as an addict or I Try not to use that terminology\nAnd we're we're it's called person first language we're fighting against that we're a person is not a diabetic first as a person with diabetes\nWe're talking to an Fletcher author the book inside rehab and you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four have you gone through this yourself do you have questions about how to pick an addiction treatment option would have your experiences Ben good or bad\nCall eight hundred six four to one two three four that's each hundred six four to one two three four or post on the ideas networks Facebook page will pick up a conversation coming up on central time\nOn wait wait don't tell me we invite accomplish people on our show answered the truly difficult question reaction is the next time you have questions like does somebody you know\nWe we try we we don't tell me the news with him and be on\nSaturday morning at nine and Sunday afternoon on Wisconsin Public radio\nAlan Johnson Swedish restaurant then boutique and sister bay home of Swedish pancakes with Lincoln berries open daily from seven to three a door county tradition since Nineteen forty nine out Johnson's dot\nCom\nWisconsin Public radio covers the state you can get the latest news from WPRI delivered right to your email was WPRI news newsletters find out how to subscribe I going to WPRI dot org you'll never missed the story with WPRI newsletter\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

assemblies and a culture where kids wanted to come to school\nThey really had a hard time moving the needle on test scores because every year they were starting over with a new crop of kids and having to\nSet new expectations for families who hadn't been with the school year over year\nAnd Erin how does Milwaukee compared to the rest of the state when it comes to to the rate of school to turn over kids going from one school to another [noise]\nOur analysis found about one in ten kids in the state of Wisconsin switch schools um either during the year or over the summer\nIn Milwaukee that's much higher across all the publicly funded schools in Milwaukee it's about one in four kids that are changing schools from year to year one set of course that yeah and that varies from school the school system of your\nHigher achieving more stable schools and the district have very low turnover and then you have a place like north division high school which has struggled as one of the lowest performing high schools in the state and they see half of their students turn over from year to year\nClara you're a teacher at ... college a charter school how does this work out in your classroom what kind of turnover do you see there\nYeah so at stellar I teach in a case for classroom and last year we had twenty six students in our classroom and we had five students who entered\nThe traditional spectrum of left and right I think it's been\nBurned up over it upside down and so I think it hurts job with the mindset that it's about service\nAbout it sees a service that career then that pressure you feel goes away right never going to get it right off but I but I just try focused on how can I have for his wife's for hardworking families in northeast confident and you know I Try to listen to the bottom up with them that I that I get one more\nWould dive into some specific issues that are on the news now that will still be out there twenty Nineteen I imagine this week we saw a high deficit numbers a big jump in this years on this year's annual deficit what would you want to do to tackle the annual deficit the growing federal done\nWell at some point what gets to the process destroyed mentioned before we can't continue this process of waiting for the last that can and then having gigantic um the ... bills are shut down in resolution I put forward a proposed in Congress\nShouldn't be allowed to go into reached that go on vacation it until we actually it was for regular order and get budgeting to white way but then if you looked longer for at the budget it sure\nHe'll worldly fighting over thirty percent of taxpayer money to rent is just going out the door every single year without any review bumped point we're gonna have to get serious about out of control costs of health care\nWhat do we do it to shore up Social Security to make sure they're in Twenty years that we do not think right now there's going to be a big cut and so it's going to require men and women if\nBoth sides yeah we'll sit down and having an honest debate you'll have to agree on everything but in order to get that budget under control in order to get\nThe conversation we're going to have nationally if we just have a bunch of money flooding into all our elections every year killing people attacking people for the issues we're never going to dance to fall down the field I hear\nOne concern that's been raised number two we might Democrats was the tax cut bill that passed earlier this year that contribute to a decline in corporate tax revenue which was part of the sun increasing the deficit and what do you think about that time that tax bill and how it's back factored into the deficit\nWhy her said that rather than its last project order are up certainly I Believe that money should be kept in the pocket of American citizens and the less money that we have being filtered through a series of special interest to watch the\nMore economic growth we're going to have which is you know I refer to that economic either before\nLast we want to make very brutal decisions and various programs that strategy we have going forward is actually grow the total I Do in my opinion\nLess taxes will help do that now the early going right now the first year that I also think there's some really innovative stuff in the tax reform proposal like the concept of opportunities to uh which will apply the capital's a flooded serious if a godsend\nWhich which could help over the long term I'm but listen I hate I think it goes back to the overall spending picture of\nSpending more and more money on a variety thing of all of 'em aren't working right now so\nEight reform we need transparency get an understanding of where the money's going first before we can figure out where to allocate thing we can stop funding failure if we can start reinforcing that\nTalking representative Mike Gallagher incumbent Republican Wisconsin's keep congressional a race\nA representative Gallagher in the news this week us relations with Saudi Arabia house Speaker Paul Ryan said is Saudi Arabia is found to have killed missing Saudi journalist ...\nCongress would look into imposing sanctions on the kingdom some of your colleagues Republican colleagues in the Senate side or even more emphatic about that idea of sanctions is that something you would support doing\nI think it would trigger sanctions bumped into back yeah it's a it's a ... or ... ... all bonded out breath\nIs taking power he's done a lot of help\nModernize country uh in in the white direction that is for sure but I have to be on it ... in Dallas that isn't the first incident that cause for concern about last year there was a kidnapping of the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri in the rest of women's rights activist Saudi diplomatic that Canada\nThere have been traveling events NBS all have the potential to be a transformative leader but he needs to play it carefully and I don't think we help him and we certainly don't help our moral standing in the world like turning a blind eye out I've spent a good deal of my adult life in uniform working in the middle east with our allies and I'll be the first to admit that\nOur allies problematic if they're not perfect oftentimes we don't share their values and we have to work with them on the average people to advance broader terms but again\nThe whole point of having close relationships with countries like Saudi Arabia to be able to nudge them in a better direction and a five by a court behavior like this if indeed the ... come out that can from day one behind\nA turning to trade the Trump Administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods side as well as those from Mexico Canada ... ... you a looming him and steal foremost among them what do you think combat strategy on trained\nWell I think you have to distinguish between two lines of effort right there's the so called section real one\nA trade activity which is getting up on China I think by and large that it's been a long overdue step I think that's a welcome step but it's really China's non Arab areas that are concerned about their plight your fears are higher than ours are still not that high things like intellectual property that um\nWhere it's facts that just sort of but that's been a good story I've been very critical of the second line of effort which is the section two thirty two terrorists these are the steel and aluminum tariffs for a couple of reasons one yes you look at the tariffs our allies have\nOurs are higher if you across the board on average a then that you in Canada or the second is a really concerned that are farmers\nAre manufacturers of farmers in Wisconsin are going to get caught in the crossfire but the first thing is even if you disagree with me if you disagree with the notion that terrorists are taxes to pick winners and losers and destroyed the free market is I Believe\nOf okay fair enough but are actually on various\nRendered this authority to the executive branch as part of the trade liberalizing as yours and I just don't think it it holds water for the White House and the executive branch to say that we have a national security threat\nPosed by ... you all the looming in from other countries I think that ... the bounds of the statute is so I think Congress should be in the business appalling that some of this already\nIs why introduce legislation that would require Congress to vote on the terrorists if the White House wants to impose them it would be retroactive for two years\nAnd again ah you know I have a disagreement with my own party on his that's fine up the constitution divides powers for the very forbid but to me it's clear under the constitution that article on the legislative branch has the authority to regulate commerce important nation\nLet's turn to him in Greece in the long running story in Congress without a lot of action from Congress over the years what would you like to see your twenty nine to\nWell I voted for Bill that I thought you know wasn't perfect but I was still a lot of the problems that would have had road blocks\nBorder security and not just a physical barrier wall but also acknowledge personnel I was fortunate enough when I was on active duty to spend some time working for the drug enforcement agency\nSpent some time at the southern border doing counter narcotics worth by the fact is border is not secure we have to do it but the other fact is that it's not just a matter of border security those people coming in our country illegally are doing it by overstating there'd be says they're not you know crossing the Rio Grande instead of the night that the more complex issue\nBut I also think you know we have to have a system as flexible enough where if people want to come here legally\nIf they want to be part of it is awesome American European they want to\nPay their taxes and ... and one day become a citizen then we should say that that's right that's part of what's made this country great for ticket a time when you know we're struggling to find workers area industry the ag industry ... going to find workers so we can do that one the same time saying we should make it difficult if not impossible\nFor people to come here illegally so I just would encourage my colleagues to kinda\nG political science is a little bit let's let's have a a more open and honest Russian and I got to believe we can stick to the games that are immigration system it's totally outdated backwards and it's hurting us economic\nUh briefly are your thoughts on health care before we went to another huge topic\nYeah on a cell phone on thirty seconds\nTo health care is is a huge issue I mean I I probably hear about that besides what I mentioned before\nMost from people um I haven't worked across the aisle with a a Democrat from Colorado to introduce a bill demanding transparency and pricing from insurance companies hospitals because it's my fundamental belief that no matter what you feel about you know the broader question how we find that health insurance\nAnd so we as consumers have health care and so we had some patients can decipher our hospital build until we can understand what we're paying for we're never going to get the power back where it should be which is with patients and doctors working together and I said that power will continue to ship upwards into big insurance companies\nBig hospital the glamorous and that's the complexity that really disadvantaged ... so I think transparency is a key first step I also would like to have a little bit more flexibility to experiment with you\nWhat about you know\nI work at a democracy that highly issue that we need people to work together\nWelder particularly in groups so what we have a larger society as a whole er which we can consider a\nIn one culture but there are stronger identities and stronger subcultures let's say black\nEnglish for example or people who were in the military or a fire fighters and things like that at any time you work in close quarters are living close quarters with people that you have a lot in common with you tend to develop your own in our language and then if you're in an environment\nWhere those words can leak and the media or into entertainment or music or what have you and you have a really good chance of you're in group language spreading to the larger community the greatest example that I Know of is a roof all and all of the drag race stuff that route does\nThat is incredible they just they find new words it generate knew where they popularized them they just continue to them just the slang machine never stops with a group called and all the people involved with his shows\nHas social media changed the spread of new words a split it up at all [noise]\nWell it has changed to spread the language was always there but now there's a better chance that something new is going to catch on but uh\nChance at quicker champ the better chance that it will burn out\nAnd this may surprise people but a lot of times we stopped using words because um somebody that we don't really care for started using it or somebody that we think is in school are worthy of respect respect for that or just because we've heard it too often so the burnout cycle to pick up cycle it's faster but the burn up cycle it's faster to\nTalking to grant Baron from Public Radio's away with words that airs Sunday mornings at nine I think I said something earlier on Sunday mornings at nine now on the ideas now we're talking about\nHow the English language changes now new words come along and grand I also want to talk about a ... old words\nThere's a process that I've seen called ... where people take mounds and turn them into ... impact or something I act and the impact something I thought grant this was something newfangled thing that we're doing I dug a little deeper Shakespeare did this a lot like compromise I guess was just a known until Shakespeare verbal sided\nHits we noun verb to be from now we turn kids into now I'm just surprised as people for example do you eat your dreams will work green green stepping down a plural now that came from and actually have a ton of this stuff um remember the old station wagon call though what do you have a website panels so\nWe this is a really standard way to form words in English changing a part of speeches absolutely ordinary always has been has always been a part of the language I'm not sure why surprises people but it's there and we can track it and Shakespeare it wasn't the first and certainly won't be the law\nAnd people fight back against this there's a backlash I think impact is a big one it's not the only down why do we push back on these is it right sometimes to push back on these kinds of changes\nThere's unnecessary friction there I I tend not to push back I've anybody who listens to show that Martha and I we have our our preferences but generally kind of let the language do take care of itself because it's it's um it's kind of make up public garden where everybody gets a plot and we all cultivated\nAnd across the whole garden or you can see the larger shift though everyone's doing Kenny that this year we're out there in the city um I think when we push back against language it's usually because we haven't stopped to think very hard about who's doing it why they're doing it how often they are doing who else is doing it what it means like\nIf you start to gather the data and think about it like a field the lexicographers somebody out there with a notebook on a tape recorder trying to record the language you begin to see patterns and you'll begin to recognize oh it's not just it's a lot of where this is how it's done across this whole category of language that's just ordinary and I just happened to find this newest apple\nCan I make a request grand for you and your dictionary type cronies now we've got this gap in the English language I think it's what is the second person plural where if I Want you to one person I see you to multiple sometimes you know what I'm Talking about\nYou all you all use all you all those are great substitute can we can we pick one of those in just make it part of the language already\n[laughter] or if not again we have one already which decided we don't like it because it off I mean the thing get our yeah who is also plural um\nWhat we're seeing now is kind of a shakeout where it looks like for example you all are becoming more common it is bleeding outside of the American south ... than ... than Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in places like that throughout Pennsylvania\nIs growing all of it some people see the need but the big winner the big winner and this is kind of

studio to talk about some of the biggest challenges we can run into when we're cooking and how to solve them\nNow Governor Walker requested approval from the federal government last year to put rules in place that would make some work mandatory for able bodied Medicaid recipients here in the state it was an issue Governor Walker worked on for years and seemingly have the support of many in his base and from members of the Trump Administration\nBut the rollout of the new rules has been slow with some political watchers wondering if a tough campaign season might be playing a role\nOur next guest has been following this topic and is here to talk about the role healthcare is playing an election bids in Wisconsin and around the country Dan diamond is the author of political pulse which covers health care politics and policy Dan welcome to central time\nMy pleasure to be here up we'll talk us through the timeline this has been out there for a while these Medicaid work requirements that Wisconsin is asking for how long has this been going on\nThis has been going on for centuries the beginning of the Trump Administration took hold back a second and I'll tell you how I came to the story and the national ...\nWisconsin is one of the doubt and dozens of states that have asked the Trump Administration for permission to impose work ... minutes on Medicaid beneficiaries and make other changes that could really hurt low income Americans and Governor Scott Walker\nMedicaid beneficiaries which she pushed for other programs in Wisconsin too\nAs well as require copayments now in some states these requests have been approved and I'd heard a few months ago that Wisconsin's approval was basically done to there was a story I ruined August that broke some news about is that Governor Walker's drug test a request was was deemed impermissible that there would be a workaround and set for that\nAnd many of the other changes that you want it did get to sign off but it's I've been waiting for the announcement and even as the Trump administration's top Medicaid official publicly teased at a few weeks ago\nWhat I've been hearing from the folks inside the administration is that Wisconsin was suddenly acting\nOdd and and less interested in this waiver than than they had then or yours is one person\nTold me it was kind of a hurry up and wait we want this done and now that it's done a Wisconsin ... was was being very new picky and creating reasons just all\nTo be fair to the uh Walker administration they they have to ... that they're selling they said that they've done everything that the Trump Administration will bonds and they're claiming the hold up on officials here and see I think the bigger issue is that Walker like many Republicans around the country is vulnerable and health care issues and and you saw some of that this week in Wisconsin as ... campaign\nReally hit him on preexisting conditions so at this point just a few weeks out from an election where a Democrat may well take over the state house in Wisconsin and then there's Medicaid waiver that Walker wanted they may never get put into law\nAnd author of a lot of books the newest one is my American Dream a life of love family and food Lydia welcome back to central time going to know them well thank you so much for coming over to the studio today now\nYou've been at this for a while you've been cooking for a long time yes\nSupport for WPRI comes from the Ashland chamber of commerce Ashland county is more than twenty five large outdoor murals painted on buildings throughout the county mural information and fall color updates are available at visit Ashland dot com yeah to grow\nAnd then ultimately share it then I I\nThink you know it's sort of a fizzles off\nSo you know what are my challenge is certainly a I Love the the seasons and there's always something new with the season and you know you're talking about cooking and uh I Would recommend to stick with the seasons are the products of the seasons are out there best usually most of the comical and yield a good meal\nAnd we're going to be talking actually on our food segment tomorrow about cooking with winter squash very seasonal right now and actually one of my colleagues I made one of your uh winter squash recipes is amazing thing with I think it was cider vinegar what are some of your favorite waved to use winter squash\nThis is an endless you know when discussion of course there's many different I think also out there in the kitchen don't just say with the with the butternut squash but there's so many the acorns are so many different squash and they all are a little bit unique you know they're the same that nice Pompeo orange and yellow we are\nAs a kind of a texture and delicious us but they do have some are more ... some of that\nAnd so from soups from from appetizers you know whether you roasted you grill it your marinated in in a in a bit of vinegar kind of a a\nAdmiring nod and then you grill it\nTo sue ... pasta I Love making in a part of the cost of this you know everybody's concerned about eating a lot of carbohydrates add more\nVegetables more proteins in a more squash squash and and and Trump's Gulf on tests that can be well you know so making a nice sauce for pasta then of course as a side they share a for for a main course roast ... ah squashed puree it just endless even desert\nNow there are a lot of things I Will cook and I'm happy to cook in the world and then I think I probably like a lot of home cooks there is something that scare me that a waste of money on this and I'm going to get it all wrong and it's going to be terrible I give us a pep talk for taking on those challenges\nWell Rob if you begin with I'm going to do it all wrong then you've got the wrong path you gotta do you know what I'm going to be challenged by this guy and of course I think what's what you do some diligent research you know look up\nReading a little bit on the subject let's say that you want to cook ... and I used to cooking Colorado will read up on it you know ... you need to know how to clean it which is somewhat of a challenge but they sell now beautiful color muddy clean frozen fresh frozen and it's perfectly fine\nAnd and then you begin on cooking you know what's very important especially with fish is temperature do I cook it a lot to echo could blow to lay under cooking so they got the money is you either cook it quick and fast or you cook it very long to get the sauce so you know once you're you're kind of have those guidelines\nYou just go and do it and you know what Rob doesn't always come the best the first time you have to try to\nOver and over again it's funny you went to see what it says 'cause that's exactly what I was thinking about when I get it wrong\nI imagine that kind of you know fish octopus and ... people are kind of a curious about them because they are you know ... out there this is the food of the day but yet to cook at home they have a little difficulties\nNow you're famous of course for Italian cooking how do you approach maybe other types of cuisines and look for elements that you can bring in and add to your own\nPalace well you know I Am kind of wedded to the Italian color Mary tradition and that is because I came to the United states as an immigrant of twelve was born in the middle east\nOh you know with my mother was Ninety eight still alive\nAnd we ... we speak Italian was dialect so but then be in trouble and coming to America I adopted America you know I I'm an American and so how do you you know communicate and my gifts has been I guess to communicate through food I bring my\nA native of a culture of food that they had him into the American so therefore I tried to respect as much as possible what's really truly happening in\nIn Italy is so that I communicate that in my book so my show or in my restaurant but I Can't say that you know I don't experiment you know ginger lemon grass do I put these in the Italians I don't put my restaurants are in my in the books but I Do play with them at home\nTalking to shop Lydia ... she's in the studio with us here in Wisconsin her latest book or one of many of my American Dream a life of love family and food last time you were on with us we talked about uh my American Dream now you're going around the country talking to people about it\nOr are you hearing a lot of people maybe we're the story really hits home with them they have similar experiences\nIt does it does because it's my story the yeah the ... real ah Lydia immigrant story so I Am an immigrant and not only a refugee on refugee we we well let me just kind of similar I said I come from a poor part of Italy north east of and\nThat was a ... billion after World War two Italy lost the war and that part if they had the peninsula was given to the newly formed communist Yugoslavia and we were caught behind communism\nAre ultimately it was difficult who couldn't speak to the Italian and we couldn't practice our religion my parents decided that you know we needed to get out of their escape back into Italy\nAnd when we were back into Italy you know it's difficult the settling we we actually spent two years in the political refugee camp and ultimately were were brought here but the Catholic Relief services\nAnd at that time Dwight Eisenhower was the president and he opened immigration for people fleeing communism that's how we came\nAnd that's the story that's but beyond that you know the book is a\nA I think you know growing up as a young girl and would grab mine and grandma had all the courtyard of animals that where my passion for food really came where wasn't born I was actually in the those formative years\nWith grandma on the farm with the animals milk in the goats picking the potatoes and all of that that my passion for food started\nAnd when you talk about food only write about food it's never just food it's family it's culture and traditions that you you don't cook\nWithout them set up food doesn't stand alone you know food needs a table and eats people around the table to appreciate it\nAnd enjoy it food nurtures us keeps us alive in some way of telling somebody you know I mean for me it's great pleasure cooking I feel I nurture people I I you know I make them happy I given an opportunity to communicate at the table it makes me very happy to see people enjoy the food\nOr you've changed my cooking I think the first time I talk to you you talked about saving the scraps into freezing the bread in the freezer and water from the past I Do that at this point my wife has stopped making fun of me revving freezers full of these scraps or any other tips like that any other things you like to say don't wasted used in another\nWay you know you know Rob I think that a common sense says sometimes overlook them people just\nSay oh I Can't cook I Can't do that but I think in the kitchen really think focus on common sense and you know what is it are you feeling that the carrots let's say you on a carrot you wash that are you feeling appeals to throw it away well\nYou freeze them with that with the salaries and whatever next time you make soup you pull it all out you put it in the ... with the chicken bones and you've got yourself a great ...\nAll right I Will and I'm guilty I throw away the compost conflict I currently live but I'll I'll start using those to God so what you're going to be talking at the book festival you're talking about your book here in Wisconsin what uh what kind of stories or you're bringing\nTo well you know it's going to be like an intimate conversation with Lydia so I Will tell them a little bit about this story intro my because they all know Lydia the chef\nThat that there is so what's the lady as real lifelike and so and they're surprised because you know they think that you know you you sort of ... I got it became a chef and this was the big success but there was a whole a truck to it and then ultimately once I attended will open it up to questions and see what the audience who'd like it's a give and take\nNow this fall it's comfort food season especially coming into winter what is Libya's comfort food what do you eat when you need that that warm sustaining nourishing thing\nWell I Love ... this is a soup time and so now it's mushroom and nice mushroom soup with barley and when I put in there some chestnuts to very much and not chestnut with mushroom and barley fantastic\nAnd you know you sort of kind of it really is mellowed caress as you as you eat it and that's a great thing that you can make a big pot and then you freeze it and then you know it's sort of keeps him giving\nI've never cooked with chest hurts you roast them first or how do they go into the soup\nWell yes you need to either roast them or boil them and then you peeled him and then you need to kind of kept about because they sort of a mellow into the soup and they remain remain like little pieces like beans mushrooms\nBarley and chest that soup that does sound comforting this time of year there you go Lydia thank you so much for joining us today I appreciate it got to see\nIs the number one problem ... most people have a mild or moderate problem not a severe problem and if you get this independent assessment with somebody who is not tied to a rehab who does not have a personal investment that's\nThe best way to go about it because they can tell you how severe your problem is and whether or not you need to go to an outpatient program which is really where about nine out of ten people wind up and one outta ten people end up in a rehab and they're really meant for the most severe cases\nMight strike people as difficult or unusual to be in effect shopping for addiction treatment but it sounds like you say that's part of what we should be doing in addition to getting back to the referral also looking at the various options and figure out what they offered picking and choosing the extent that we care\nIt's exactly what people should be doing one of the experts\nWho I interviewed and who helped me with a book is Dr Thomas McClellan and he said I'm most people spend more time shopping for a vacuum cleaner or a washing machine then they do looking for addiction\nTreatment and um you know that's a pretty sad state of affairs I'm about to have back surgery and I consulted several experts before I decided who was going to put a knife and my back but we don't think that way we panic\nAnd most people I mean there are people who are about to die from substance use disorder and you need to get them help quickly and sometimes\nWe often what people do is they turn to their neighborhood they turn to somebody they know um they turn to their doctor and many I Would say venture to say most physicians really don't know a whole heck of a lot about addiction treatment um most of\nUs when we have a problem can take some time it doesn't matter if you wait a few weeks or even a month\nUm take time to find an expert in their community I can think of several and my relatively small university town where you you go to this expert who can give you an independent assessment of what you and maybe that person turns out to be the person who ... who you end up seeing\nUm who can council you one on one because if you go to treatment\nWhether it's an outpatient program or a very fancy rehab you're going to end up in groups\nUm some of the most for the just programs that I went to\nPeople were in group treatment I figured out about eight hours out of a Fifteen hour a day and I thought to myself if I were going to send one of my young adult kids\nTo spend thirty thousand dollars on rehab I Would never have guessed that eight hours of that Fifteen hour a day we're going to be in group treatment and that's excluding lunch and meditation groups but that that really floored me\nTalking to an ... her new book is inside rehab the Surprising Truth about addiction treatment and how to get help that works\nYou know there's this obituary from Burlington free press and Vermont has gone viral it's written by the mother of a young woman who died of an addiction and and I want to go just one bit of a very relevant to your your book ... if you work in one of the many institutions which addicts often passed rehab hospital jails courts and treat them with\nIf instead you see a junkie or the or lie or in front of you rather than a human being in need of help consider a new profession so as you looked at rehab centers and the other options out there what attitude did you see\nUs in terms of the\nWhich side of that ...\nPeople were on well it it it depends um\nI found some of the facilities\nThat I went to war using terminology like\nAll addicts are the same I'm using terms like junkies and if you like somebody that junkie people you need to understand that this disorder there's controversy about whether you want to call it whether it's a disease\nEven though most professional organizations feel that it's a disease I feel like let's not waste time arguing about what it is it is by the time somebody has a severe use disorder\nIt I I feel it's a disease and it takes hold and it's all the person can think about let's treated with respect and recognize it that way it's controlling a person's life at\nThat point and to use pejorative language I'm like junkie um even clean somebody's clean I cringe every time I hear somebody say he's clean and sober\nUm or he has a dirty urine he had a dirty urine that suggests that when you say somebody clean it suggests that they were dirty when they were using we would never say that about somebody with diabetes um when they have a positive urine test\nWe need to stop and fight against the stigma\nThat I'm with which addiction people with addiction are treated I ... I never refer to somebody as an addict or I Try not to use that terminology\nAnd we're we're it's called person first language we're fighting against that where a person is not a diabetic first as a person with diabetes\nWe're talking to an Fletcher all through the book inside rehab and you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four have you gone through this yourself do you have questions about how to pick an addiction treatment option would have your experiences Ben good or bad\nCall eight hundred six four to one two three for that seat hundred six four to one two three four or post on the ideas network Facebook\nPage or pick up a conversation coming up on central time\nAll the PBS shows many children are now twenty four hours a day and then you can ... can you a little bit about whenever and wherever the children in your in my mind educational television Wisconsin Public television in there for you ...\nWatch over the air or free anytime anywhere\nSupport for WPRI comes from Hooper corporation supplying custom construction services including electric power mechanical in green technology to commercial industrial and utility customers nationwide Hooper corporation uh Wisconsin companies since Nineteen Thirteen\nSupport also comes from Madison country day school and independent pre K through grade twelve college preparatory school fostering a lifelong love for learning in smaller class sizes open house November temp Madison country day dot org\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.
