unusual markings are postage Quil Lawrence NPR News New York\nPresident Trump's delivering on his threat to send more troops to the southern us border with Mexico to keep a caravan of thousands of Central Americans from crossing illegally Here's NPR's Tom Bowman\nThe department of homeland security has made a request to the point of going to send hundreds of troops down to the border\nTo help

and engineers\nAgain to assist border patrol not to take part in any sort of a law enforcement activities and we're told they're likely be active duty troops or Army Reserve troops\nThat's NPR's Tom Bowman under law troops are only allowed to serve as support that are not permitted to get involved in law enforcement the caravan is reported to be more than a thousand miles away thousands of men women children and grandparents have embarked on the arduous journey saying they're attempting to put more distance between them and the violence and poverty up their home countries\nAnd firing up his

Duffy\nAs part of our series of candidate interviews he's running for re election in northern Wisconsin seventh congressional district\nFirst news broke yesterday that pipe bombs had been sent a prominent Democrats including former president Brock Obama former secretary of State Hillary Clinton former vice president Joe Biden along with other democratic politicians CNN was also evacuated for a similar package containing an explosive device\nAll of this suspicious packages were intercepted before they made it to their intended targets and now there's a nationwide search on her way to find the culprit\nBut the fact that multiple devices were sent a high profile critics of President Trump and recipients of his criticism and have people asking whether political rhetoric may be encouraging people to commit violent act our next guest is here to talk about the divisive speech in ...\nDon Haider Markel is professor and chair of political science at the University of Kansas Don welcome back to central time\nAfternoon well\nWith the qualification that we don't know who's behind these attacks are or what their motivation was do you see a connection big picture between heated political rhetoric and threats or actual acts of violence\n[noise] well I think that rhetoric is taking place in the context ... obviously they have a very divided and politically polarized polarized country um\nSo it's it's more ... that that rhetoric and inflammatory speech the um derogatory language against a political opponents and painting them as enemies\nI'm In this particular context is more dangerous than it might be at another ...\nWhy is that\nI think the the basic fact of the matter\nIs they're always um people out there that we can label as political extremists and some of those people in some moments maybe incited to act\nOn those beliefs and engage in violence against what they perceive as their enemies um and\nThe speech itself then basically helps lead them to the conclusion that uh they're elected leaders they're public officials that can't act on these beliefs or need somebody to act for them and they're willing to take those steps\nWant to go to listen to President Trump he responded yesterday afternoon to these pipe bombs in the mail saying there was no place for this kind of activity speaking in Wisconsin last night campaigning for Republicans ahead of the mid term election he acknowledged the news here is a little bit of what he had to say\nOne way to satellite disagreements it's called peacefully at the ballot box that's when we\nAs\nPart of a larger national effort to bridge divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil town as you stop the endless hostility and constant\nBut there are there was a whole slew of issues that people are talking about women talking about the economy and jobs they're talking about security at the southern border health care I'll also talking about trade deals and tear up so he goes by the Ford issues I hear the most about it on a continuous basis\nLet's start with those tariffs there's been some concern lately about the impact of tariffs on Wisconsin manufacturers and farmers to for that matter what direction you want to see the federal government take when it comes to trade policy\n[noise] well I I Believe in free trade but free trade has to be fair trade in what do you have\nA countries around the world that have a tariffs and non tariff barriers that American manufacturers are produced goods but we have an open market for their manufactured and produce good that's not fair and so we're forced to compete in the world with one hand tied behind their back and I\nI appreciate the president actually fighting to make sure\nAh Canada and Mexico as well as a Europe and and especially China treat our goods\nAre like we treat their goods um and you know specifically with China you know the presence out trying to do two things that set us and we want you to stop stealing our intellectual property number one number to treat our good old for your good stop putting all these terrorists on American manufactured goods\nAnd to that uh the the Chinese have said no and the president said okay well I I'm going to retaliate and push back on your China and tell you I'm being more free and open market you just can't take advantage of a U.S like that and in the long run\nThis is going to be better for\nThe American worker to this is a long term play making sure that we can continue to have great jobs that pay our our family as well because we make great products here that we can all around the world and barriers don't shut our goods out or not because we don't make the best products or the best price products but because they put terrorists out our products\nA lotta people I've talked with said OK yeah China that's one thing they're doing a lot of things wrong with it and they're kind of trading rivals with trading partners and allies like Canada the EU Mexico\nA CERN there's disagreements we should be negotiating not having these escalating tariffs battled do you worry we are getting paid too much of a confrontational relationship there\nThem if you could negotiate nicely and say hey this isn't fair where you were you treated fairly if that was their case we could have done this Twenty years ago um but that's not the case in until you push these other countries they're not going to give up the benefits they have in their trade with United States of America the conversation didn't work and so I mean if you look at\nYou know Canada they're allegedly a a great friend of ours\nBut in trade not so much that we saw what happened when grassland dairy lost their markets in Canada over Seventy farms didn't have a home to sell their milk anymore and that is a huge impact on our dairy that's because\nThey've closed off\nUm their market to um a lot of our dairy products and the president could have cut a deal with NAFTA a lot earlier um but he was holding out to cut a better deal for American dairy\n'em and specifically Wisconsin dairy and and and I'm grateful for that and it's it's not perfect but we have a better deal today than we did before the president renegotiated\nIn regard it there\nYou also mentioned immigration is a top priority this has been a long running issue Congress has tried and not come up with solutions to a lot of the contentious issues out there what would you be advocating for ... in another term in Congress when it comes to immigration\nSo I Would tell you that we actually have a lot of bipartisan support I Know I'm going to shock your listeners on\nThis but this the the sides are not that far apart um yeah I think the answer is pretty simple one you need to secure your border whether part of it is with a wall or or with technology and how do you want to do it you gotta security border [noise] we have to deal with the people who are in our country and working who you know go to church there they they work\nForty plus hours a week they shop at Walmart\nThe good folks um find a way to give them a path to legal status\nOr deal with the DACA kids do you want to give a path to citizenship and then what we have to do is allow 'em a far more work visa so we can let people come into the country and meet the demands of our economy that are being ... by\nUh the uh the American worker um and by the way when we when we don't have on employment that so low and it actually starts at picked back up again because economies are cyclical those workers moved back out of the country and those jobs will\nRemain for American families um and then you have to have some type of internal verification system like e verify so you can bring people in but you got to verify that\nPeople are also here in the workforce working illegally and so that instead of having you know four\nThousand seven thousand people coming across a Mexican desert and you know you know you you share that you see the pictures are horrible up the plight of the of the march feeling good on a plane and they can\nFly they can fly to Madison or or Duluth or last saw and you know take up a job or that another American doesn't want a I think this is the most rational approach and others about there's a lot of Democrats and Republicans agreed to this approach just two weeks on the edges that we have to fix this is the simplest\nThe easiest way to in the long run deal with this problem and it's one of the point then we have this those were coming across the border lawfully\nThere are people who you know they're running guns or drugs or um or or legal um a gun and just want to point to as it was we deal with this uh this crisis of drugs of of\nMadison heroin virtually all those drugs are coming across the southern border secure on that border and and doing our best to keep those drugs out I think is incredibly important in our new fight to get these drugs are that are devastated in our community is in our family as a kid getting them a under control\nTalking with Sean Duffy Republican incumbent in Wisconsin some congressional district in our series of candidate interviews for the November election\nI turned to the deficit it's gone up this year at the eight years so I've just recovering from the great recession people like to see deficits go down around this time what are your thoughts on the causes and cures for the federal deficit\nYeah it's it's a big issue so Twenty one plus trillion dollars in debt I'm I I think those two things that happen one you have to continue to grow your economy um like we are right now and you know the cap you're spending you don't get cut spending just have to stop it from growing this cap it\nUm you do those two things are going to be able to get our that our right sized other problem is\nThe federal government continues to to spend more uh spend more money um but I Will know that if you look at the revenue side or even with the tax cuts that gave great tax breaks to uh everybody who pay taxes are paying less taxes if if you don't pay any taxes you don't get a tax break but\nYou know every family on average you know it was going to save over two thousand dollars a year in Wisconsin um\nFrom individuals because they're making more money and more people are actually working [noise] the revenue from corporations to the federal coffers has gone down I think that was expected as you know start to see corporations bring in more of their business back they're bringing their money back or the President Trump mentioned this last night that apple\nIs bringing back three hundred and fifty billion dollars from overseas and invested in here in America when those investments take place in the quarter is you're going to see a that revenue continue to increase to the federal coffers because of growth and re investment from corporations\nWant to get the healthcare another issue you mentioned important in your district a lot of people talking about this now what you want to see when it comes to federal health care policy [noise] so I I\nBelieve that um our family I don't ... I don't believe in the Medicare for all a model I I think that um your your what it will actually what you do with the Bernie Sanders why would you take\n'em Medicare for seniors who take pride care I'm away from our veterans you take everyone's individual planning whether it's employer sponsored or their own plans and you put them all into a government plan it costs thirty two trillion dollars over ten years I don't think that's the right approach [noise] having a model that could incentivize of\nUm families to pick plans that fit the needs that in a risk that they have in their life at at prices that they can afford making hospitals and doctors and clinics and insurance companies competing for your business is the best way forward\nAnd then making sure we have a system that to take care of the poorest members of our community also making sure you have high risk pools that make insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions\nI think that the best model but I'm a realist if you look at the politics today the parties have gone and then America has gone in polar opposite directions and I don't see a pathway to move forward from the place that we're at right now we're health care\nOr health care works really well if you're rich and it works pretty well if you're a poor because you get a lot of subsidies but there's a lot of middle income people who are\nYou know for a family of four paying Eighteen you know Eighteen hundred dollars a month with a seven\nThousand dollars a doctor bill and prices are going up even further so he was I think we do I think we\nSaid listen I Will will will will call a truce liberals and conservatives left given money back to the states the federal money give it back to the states will have to pay a little argument about how you do what you do it on the size of poverty gotta but equally and fairly divided up the money give it back to the state\nOf California wants to do a single\nPayer government run health care system and so too does New York great and if you know Texas and you know a Michigan and Montana and Wisconsin want to find more free enterprise system they can try that to you would have fifty different models of of state driven healthcare [noise]\nIndividuals discover that experience they had a was something that was mirrored in the book and so if it if it turned out to be ah appropriate yeah included is\nTalking to Michael Norman author of hunted Wisconsin we're getting some spooky stories from around the seats are leading up to Halloween if you've got one by the way your your home

coming in and out the door and the other one's pretty stable you might want to look at those schools differently if you're looking at different reforms are different things to\nProvide them with to improve so we just found that you know this issue is is hard to track his kids move and you have to have data systems that are sophisticated enough to follow them\nBut what we found is just a lot of people don't even defined movement that year moves or moving over the summer in the same way so a lot of kids just aren't tracked and as a result a lot of people don't know very much about this issue\nThat's interesting this is a problem where the cause is it's not anybody doing anything wrong it's parents making rational decisions at schools doing the best they can write a there's not there's not like a bad guy in some ways no\nThere's really nobody to point the finger at and as for an example explain later you know parents which the kids in the new schools for all kinds of reasons and sometimes that's economic instability and people are reacting because they don't like a school or they don't like people out of school\nBut sometimes people don't need to make a new choice or need to make a switch for other reasons maybe someone got a new job or they're moving to a new city and the problem is\nA switch looks like a switch unless you dig into the reasons why that is which is happening and most importantly what kind of support for their for parents and new kids coming into schools and what support so therefore teachers and staff\n... year at Wisconsin Public radio is going beyond ... we're reading on what issues are important to you both election soundtrack back from ... would be more affordable\nI'm an E. M. S. worker so I see a lot of people that are making decisions about whether to buy drugs prescriptions that they need or whether it's not right\nTo be the stories already Sherry around they make WPRI I'd gotten more arrogant slash violent\nSupport for WPRI comes from Rogers behavioral health providing treatment for addiction depression and mood disorders and children teens and adults programs are available at locations throughout Wisconsin Rogers be H. dot org\nSupport also comes from F PC live presenting the all female folk Americana bluegrass group I'm with her friday November second at the Wisconsin union theater tickets and info are at union dot whisk dot edu\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nYou're listening to central time I'm Rob ferret coming up a lot has been written lately about President Trump's false statements especially at a string of rallies will look at the role of fact checking and how people can evaluate claims made by politicians\nFirst if you've already completed an expedition to both north and south poles are one of the few Americans do have skied to both the polls as well and somebody at Mount Everest what do you do next where you go to Wisconsin of course maybe not as frigid are quite as dangerous but Wisconsin has some appeal to adventurers\nOr next ... our next guest grew up in Wisconsin and returned to complete what he's called the Wisconsin fond of\nThe journey by foot bike and kayak Erik Larson is a polar adventure expedition guide dog musher and educator he spent the past Fifteen Years traveling and some of the most remote and wild places on earth and he's returned to his home state for this nine day five hundred mile journey which he completed yesterday Eric welcome to central time\nUh Eric are you there\nAre we just had him on the studio linked to Milwaukee Eric I think we have now are you there I Am fantastic now you grew up in Wisconsin you've been to both the polls you've done all this adventurous stuff what lady to say hey I'm going to go back to my home state and make my way from one border to the other\nI think a big part of my expeditions are about talking about bigger ideas and I wanted to have a conversation with people about the fact that adventure is really everywhere and you don't have to go to these extreme places to find unique and compelling adventures\nRight yeah I'm probably never going to go to a poll I'll be honest with you but but for for those of us in my less adventurous frame of mind how can we charted out an adventure in our in our backyard or home state\nI mean there is a million things that you can do basically anywhere and it just takes a little bit of creativity and or extra thought are planning or are quite honestly not a lot of planning whatsoever I mean\nAh Wisconsin has a lot of state parks a lot of um [noise] you know natural areas there's a lot of opportunities to get outside and I think people just need a little bit of a reminder that hey there are some pretty unique opportunities right and your own backyard and that's again really what this trip is all about\nLet's talk about your route and logistics side Traverse City in Wisconsin you started on the ice age tale in a trail in St Croix in the northwest part of the state you're on foot or they're not rice lake you switch to bike and then kayak from west bend to Lake Michigan share some of the highlights of the trip [noise]\nWell you know each leg was kind of a unique journey for me growing up in Wisconsin I've been all over the state but still I managed to reverse some areas that I hadn't been but I mean hiking on the ice age trail was pretty incredible peak fall colors\nLeaves falling as I was hiking through 'em so many leaves on the ground that I couldn't even see the trail in certain areas so that was pretty amazing\nI think you know the middle of Wisconsin has some of the best road biking in road bike touring in the entire country I mean all the paved a\nCounty highways and farm roads and uh just beautiful areas rolling through farm fields and kind of would lots in small towns\nUm pretty amazing although I did run into some a somewhat bad weather and snowstorms on the bike which you know I shouldn't complain too much about snow but I I Would say it's probably one of the more ah cold times that I've I've ever had\nUm and then paddling rate down to Milwaukee River into Milwaukee I'm you know it's really interesting\nTo be on the river and be surrounded by trees and and here forty three hear sirens or whatever in the background but still be in this real isolated area and then I have to say paddling right through downtown Milwaukee was incredible\nAnd you were on your own for this trip nine days on your own what is it like to have that kind of a solitude without a lot of those easy everyday distractions we have around us [noise]\nYeah it's incredible I mean I think that's the other really unique thing about adventure and getting outside it gives you an opportunity to kind of disconnect from\nThe hectic pace of our of our world that we're all in that I'm In and and so being able to focus on one goal and one objective for an entire day and and kinda let my thoughts wander I think it was a really incredible thing of course there's times where I Am\nI'm like oh man this is really hard and I don't want to be out here and I wish I was home but\nAnd um and then it becomes very enjoyable\nNow how does it Wisconsin kid being a ended up being a polar explore\n[noise] well I think the main requirement is growing up in Wisconsin I mean we don't have mountains we don't have oceans but we have some cold winters or at least we used to\nAnd so for me I really got interested in in doing outdoor adventure by just doing things like there was constant in my backyard on cedar creek and then walk river I was involved with river edge nature center a growing up and their summer camps and had some\nAre really kind of unique adventure experiences both there as well as with my family\nAnd this is full circle your kind of raising funds and awareness right for a river as nature Centre\nYeah I have a basic motto is called have fun and do good and so I like to do things that are interesting to me and and fun but I also want to try to give back in any way I can and I think as I mentioned earlier adventure has given me a lot of really great gifts in life\nI'm from my perspective and skills and knowledge that I've learned in in a big part of that was that river edge and so uh we're still actively raising money I'm trying to raise five thousand dollars to help others have the opportunity to go to river edge nature Centre summer camps\nDoes going to both the polls in Mount Everest and more does it when you come back to Wisconsin do you look at it in a different way [noise]\nI mean the thing about those trips is that um I think you're pretty much the same person that ... when a before you left but\nYou're also just changed in ways that you can't even imagine so I think for me when I come back to Wisconsin I feel a greater appreciation of where I'm from and my roots and the comedian which I grew up\nOr you just completed this trip I literally yesterday I think now you're working on a plan to head back to the south pole next month to I have that right\nYeah that's correct you know a a goal with my adventures is to really push that leading edge it's um how can we do things in a in a more unique more compelling more compelling and oftentimes more challenging way and so I have a another expedition a solo expedition planned to the south pole\nOr I'm hoping to be set the speed record I'm\nOf the journey of around seven hundred miles to the south pole\nAnd you're doing a lot of skiing or how do you how do you set that record yes skiing\nAnd pulling a sled and it's in the style that we call an support in on ate it and so I'm not receiving any outside assistance I'll be pulling all my supplies and a sled with me and I'm hoping that the journey will take between Twenty one and twenty three days\nWow how do you how do you set yourself up for that mentally and physically\nI mean I stared awaits you to pay for all day long uh [laughter]\nIt's hard you know a big part of what I Do on a trip like this is experience you know I've been doing polar expeditions now for almost Twenty years and\nAnd so a lot of my preparation is based off of that a lot of physical training is really important um which is part of ... one of the reasons a smaller reason why I did this was ... trip\nAnd then just punting preparing all my gear on my food I'm going over all those lists and making sure that I have [noise]\nYou know all my eyes dot at MIT crossed\nAnd leave us with a bit of inspiration Eric how to take on an adventure even if it isn't a twenty plus days at the south pole\nI mean I my philosophy is begin with one step 'em all you need to do is just take one step to get out there and and there's a lot of adventure waiting to be had\nA good place to leave that Eric thanks a lot for joining us in our Milwaukee studio today thank you Erik Larson as a polar adventure expedition guided dog mushing\nHome state Wisconsin for five hundred mile journey by foot bike and kayak when she completed yesterday you can learn more about his expeditions and read his blog Erik Larson explore dot com that's Larson L. A. R. S. E. N.\nComing up how do you know us and liked it official or political candidate is telling the truth a lie or something in between we'll talk about some ways we can do our own facts checking and look at the role of the media in evaluating the things politicians say and claim\nOn the levels of the weighted average of what they really care about the Kim way less about that John and they care way more about okay we finally have a president that maybe by advocate and so all of that other nonsense that he does an existential nonsense is less important to them\nAnd that's a more or less supporter of the president saying he lies but it's no big deal so as the public watches it as the media watches it use it as we ignore that stuff and focus on the actual executive actions of the White House\nI think it's possible to do more than one things simultaneously we have plenty of news media out there that are fully capable of doing both of these things\nI just don't see how anybody in the electorate can have a sense of discussion about policy or about the causes that many people consider to be terribly important if they don't have a sound factual basis for doing that\nIf if you don't have a factual basis then it's all either wishful thinking or fantasy that is a driving your decisions and I think there's a segment of the population and I'm not saying it's exclusively Trump supporters there are probably other people but also operate this way\nWho want to hear statements\nTheir world view and if somebody will do that then there'll be happy to follow them if someone challenges that\nThey will push it away because it it makes them feel uncomfortable insecure um and\nIt basically disrupts their their view of the world\nUm you know I think one of the things that I Will tell my students or if I'm not speaking to the public is that it's incumbent upon all of us to challenge ourselves into seek out sources of information that are reliable\nBut which don't necessarily agree with our preconceived notions but increasingly today it seems like people seek out the things that ... from what they already think is true and go from there with the assumption that in fact it is\nTalk of the June currently from University of Minnesota director ... Center for the study of media ethics some moss talking about the role of media in\nA challenging inaccurate statements lives from political figures of President Trump and others do we seen this rise in these things called the facts checkers facts checking groups their whole job is to take statements from usually politicians\nAre run them through the track them down and see if they're true or not in rape them through falls or somewhere in between a lot of this doesn't make any difference\n[noise] I don't know if it ultimately makes any difference if you're talking about the small percentage I Hope it's a small percentage of people who really are not interested in having the way they view the world challenge\nBut if you're talking about people who would like to get to facts not I'm not going to say the truth because there probably isn't a the truth out there but we know that there are facts\nThere are facts that are provable and what I think many of these fact checkers are doing is is testing that sometimes I Know that some of the fact checkers like the ones with the Washington Post for example\nWill read things on a sliding scale they'll say something like mostly true mostly falls and that's reality oftentimes because sometimes it's hard to get to to the ultimate facts and of course sometimes again\nPoliticians are speaking in a rhetorical way and they're maybe not being intending to say that something is literally true or false\nBut it seems to me that there's a tremendous hunger out there for truth the problem is that so many people have been conditioned to believe that no one in the news media whatever that means is actually interested in giving them unvarnished facts that want to spend it\nAnd so therefore they will trust primarily the institutions that they're most comfortable with and discounts\nAh information that comes from those that they don't\nThere's a lot of debate over how to present an inaccurate statement so I had Lyme\nOr if it's politician says blank a and that's a false statement are you just transmitting the false statements if you say politician inaccurately says blank well are you may be riding over some of the gray area you were just talking about how do you you know in a headlining a lead\nA state that without ... and and speaking of that it's all\nWell it's not always possible to get it into the headline but I Hope you can get it into the lead paragraph the first paragraph or so to say that this politician is making this claim but in fact the the truth\nIs ex um I think it's important to do those things the notion that objectivity means that you present all sides in a neutral way presumes that all sides are acting in good faith and and sadly what we've been learning in the last few years is that is not always the case\nOf President Trump was in Wisconsin and most new Wisconsin yesterday to campaign for Governor Scott Walker Senator Kennedy and we are near you say the Democrats so he he criticized other Democrats around the country and then he said this about the media he was talking here about Democrats on immigration and California\nI said the other night jokingly\nHe said he was going to give them a Rolls Royce do not say that the governor to have a good job with this you can be even a little shocked [noise]\nSo how do we know when a public figure a President Trump is is joking engaging playful hyperbole to even take a statement and say okay we need to evaluate the truthfulness of it\nWell I think the reality is that although certainly there are politicians that will make jokes we also know that oftentimes saying I was just kidding I was just joking\nIs uh the response of a bully who is being called on telling a false ... statement that it's offensive\nUm you know I I Would like to think that as a nation lead to retain a sense of humor and there certainly is a place for humor in politics but when you're making a factual\nStatement that you know your audience is very likely to take as such it seems to me have a response of the silly to be clear cut about what you're doing and I think\nPresident Trump or you know frequently doesn't do that\nWe're talking about political facts checking with Jane currently a professor of media ethics at the University of Minnesota\nYou can join the discussion that eight hundred six four to one two three four how do you evaluate the truthfulness of political claims what do you think the role of the media should be in calling out public figures when they say things that are factually wrong call eight hundred six four

including former president Brock Obama former secretary of State Hillary Clinton former vice president Joe Biden along with other democratic politicians CNN was also evacuated for a similar packages containing an explosive device\nAll of this suspicious packages were intercepted before they made it to their intended targets and now there's a nationwide search on her way to find the culprit\nBut the fact that multiple devices are sent a high profile critics of President Trump and recipients of his criticism and have people asking whether political rhetoric may be encouraging people to commit violent acts our next guest is here to talk about the divisive speech and politics and what can be done to calm things down\nDon Haider Markel is professor and chair of political science at the University of Kansas Don welcome back to central time\nAfternoon\nWell with the qualification that we don't know who's behind these attacks are or what their motivation was do you see a connection big picture between heated political rhetoric and threats or or actual acts of violence [noise]\nWell I think that rhetoric is taking place in the context of obviously there's a very divided and politically voter polarized country um so it's\nAm I tore speech the derogatory language against a political opponents and painting them as enemies I'm In this particular context is more dangerous than it might be at another ... why is that\nI think the the basic fact of the matter is they're always um people out there that we can label as political extremists and some of those people in some moments\nMaybe incited to act on those beliefs and engage in violence against what they perceive as their enemies um and the speech itself then basically helps lead them to the conclusion that\nUh they're elected leaders they're public officials that can't act on these beliefs needs somebody to act for them and they're willing to take those steps\nWant to go to listen to President Trump he responded yesterday afternoon to these pipe bombs in the mail saying there was no place for this kind of activity speaking in Wisconsin last night campaigning for Republicans ahead of the mid term election he acknowledged the news here is a little bit of what he had to say\nOne way to start a large disagreements it's called peacefully at the ballot box sets when we\nAs\nPart of a larger national effort to bridge divides and bring people together\nOr there was a whole slew of issues that people are talking about one than talking about the economy and jobs they're talking about security of the southern border healthcare also talking about trade deals um and Tara\nI hear the most about on a continuous basis\nLet's start with those parents there's been some concern lately about the impact of tariffs on Wisconsin manufacturers and farmers to for that matter what direction you want to see the federal government take when it comes to trade policy [noise]\nWell I I Believe in free trade but free trade has to be fair trade in what do you have\nA countries around the world that have a tariff to non tariff barriers that American manufacturers are produced goods but we have an open market for their manufactured and produce good that's not fair and so we're forced to compete in the world with one hand tied behind their back and I I appreciate the president actually fighting\nTo make sure ah Canada and Mexico as well as a Europe and and especially China treat our goods are like we treat their goods um and you know specifically with China\nYou know the president is trying to do two things is that us and we're going to stop stealing our intellectual property number one number to treat are good for your good stop putting all these tariffs on American manufactured goods and to that uh the the Chinese have said no and the president said okay well I I'm going to retaliate\nAnd push back on your China and tell you I'm being more free and open market you just can't take advantage of a U.S like that and in the long run\nThis is going to be better for the American worker to this is a long term play making sure that we can continue to have great jobs that pay our our family as well because we make great products here that we can all around the world and barriers don't shut our goods out\nNot because we don't make the best products or the best price products but because they put terrorists out our products\nA lotta people I've talked with said OK yeah China that's one thing they're doing a lot of things wrong with it and they're kind of trading rivals with trading partners and allies like Canada the EU Mexico\nA CERN there's disagreements used to be negotiating not having these escalating tariffs battled do you worry we are getting too much of a confrontational relationship there\nWas some ... if you could just negotiate nicely and say hey this isn't fair where you were you treated fairly\nIf that was their case we could have done this Twenty years ago um but that's not the case in and tell you push these other countries they're not going to give up the benefit they have in their trade with United States of America the conversation didn't work and so I mean if you look at\nYou know Canada they're allegedly a a great friend of ours but in trade not so much that we saw what happened when grassland dairy lost their markets Canada's over Seventy farms didn't have a home to sell their milk anymore and that is a huge impact on our dairy that's because they've closed off\nUm their market to um a lot of our dairy products and the president could have cut a deal with NAFTA a lot earlier um but he was holding out to cut a better deal for American dairy 'em and specifically Wisconsin dairy and and and I'm grateful for that and it's it's not perfect\nBut we have a better deal today than we did before the president renegotiated NAFTA better deal with with Canada in regard it there\nYou also mentioned immigration as a top priority this has been a long running issue Congress has tried and not come up with solutions to a lot of the contentious issues out there what would you be advocating for ... in another term in Congress when it comes to immigration so\nTell you that we actually have a lot of bipartisan support I Know I'm going to shock your listeners on this because the the sides are not that far apart um yeah I think the answer is pretty simple one you need to secure your border whether it part of it is with a law or\nOr with technology you however you want to do it you gotta security border [noise] we have to deal with the people who are in our country and working who you know go to church there they they work forty plus hours a week they shop at Walmart the good folks um\nIs a deal with the DACA kids joined came a path to citizenship and then what we have to do is allow 'em a far more work visa so we can let people come into the country and meet the demands of our economy that are being ... by\nA ... the uh the American worker um and by the way when we when we don't have on employment that so low and it actually just picked back up again because economies are cyclical those workers moved back out of the country in those jobs will remain for American families\nUm and then you have to have some type of internal verification system like e verify so you could bring people in\nBut you got to verify that people are also here in the workforce working illegally and so that instead of having you know four thousand or a seven thousand people coming across a Mexican desert and you know you know you you share that you see the pictures are horrible up the plight of the of the march people\nGet on a plane and they can fly they can fly to Madison or [noise] or Duluth or last saw and you know take up a job or that another American doesn't want a I think this is the most rational approach and others about there's a lot of Democrats and Republicans agree to this approach just tweaks on the edges that we have to fix\nThis is the simplest and easiest way to in the long run deal with this problem is one of the point then we have this those were coming across the border lawfully\nThere are people who you know they're running guns or drugs or um or or or legal\nUm a gun and just want to point to as it was we deal with this ah this crisis of drugs\nOf of Madison heroin virtually all drugs are coming across the southern border secure on that border in and doing our best to keep those drugs out I think is incredibly important in our new fight to get these drugs are that are devastated in our communities and our families and kid getting them on a under control\nTalking to us on the Republican incumbent in Wisconsin some congressional district in our series of candidate interviews for the November election\nI turned to be a death to tie it's gone up this year at the eight years so I've just recovering from the great recession people like see deficits go down around this time what are your thoughts on the causes and cares for the federal deficit\nYeah it's it's a big issue so Twenty one plus trillion dollars in debt\nI'm I I think those two things about that but in one you have to continue to grow your economy um like we are right now and yet the cap you're spending you don't have to cut spending just have to stop it from growing just kept it [noise] um you do those two things are going to be able to get our debt or right sized other problem is\nAh the federal government continues to to spend more uh spend more money\nUm but I Will know that if you look at the revenue side or even with the tax cuts that gave great tax breaks to uh everybody who pay taxes are paying a lot of taxes if if you don't pay any taxes you don't get a tax break but you know every family on average\nYou know it was going to save over two thousand dollars a year in Wisconsin I'm\nActually more revenue has gone into the federal coffers from individuals because they're making more money and more people are actually working\n[noise] their revenue from corporations to the federal coffers has gone down and I think that was expected as you know start to see corporations bringing more of their business back they're bringing their money back or that President Trump mentioned this last night that apple\nWas bringing back three hundred and fifty billion dollars from overseas and invest in here in America when those investments take place in the out quarter is you're going to see a that revenue continue to increase to the federal coffers because of growth and reinvestment from corporations\nWant to get the health care and other you mentioned important in your district a lot of people talking about this now what do you want to see when it comes to federal health care policy [noise]\nSo I I Believe that\nThe Medicare for all a model I I think that um your to do what it will actually what you do with the Bernie Sanders bottles you take\n'em Medicare for seniors who take pride care I'm away from our veterans you take everyone to individual planning whether it's employer sponsored do their own plans and you put them all into a government plan it costs thirty two trillion dollars over ten years I don't think that's the right approach\nI bring a model that good incentive biases um families depict plans that fit the needs that in the risk that they have in their life at a price as they can afford\nMaking hospitals and doctors and clinics and insurance companies competing for your business is the best way forward and then making sure we have a system that the take care of the poorest members of our community also making sure you have high risk pools that\nMake insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions I think that the best model but I'm a realist if you look at the politics today the parties have gone and then America has gone in polar opposite directions and I don't see a pathway\nTo move forward from the place that we're at right now we're health care or health care works really well if you're rich and it works pretty well if you're a poor because you get a lot of subsidies but there's a lot of middle income people who are you know for a family of four are paying\nEighteen you know Eighteen hundred dollars a month with a seven thousand dollars a doctor bowl and prices are going up even further so he was I think we do I think we said listen I Will will will will call a truce liberals and conservatives\nLeft given money back to the states the federal money give it back to the states well I'll tell you a little argument about how you do what you do the size or poverty gotta but equally unfairly divide up the money give it back to the state of California wants to do a single payer government run health care system and so to those New York great\nAnd if you know Texas and you know a Michigan and Montana and Wisconsin wanna try more free enterprise system they can try that gee you would have fifty different models of of state driven healthcare [noise] and if I'm wrong\nIndividuals discover that an experience they had a was something that was mirrored in the book and so if it if it turned out to be a appropriate yeah included as\nTalking to Michael Norman author of hunted Wisconsin we're getting some spooky stories from around the states are leading up to Halloween if you've got one by the way or your home and your community a local legend you can share it with the\nEight hundred six four to one two three four a Michael I met you actually some years back as the joy

out to be he thinks\nThe ghost of of this particular individual though you know ... stories sometimes are all around you if you know you know where to look and also understand that sometimes people\nAren't real I'm anxious to share the story especially in a public way\nUm you know there's still that that feeling that well you see them go it's like saying UFOs or the or something\nOr you were going to share I think a couple of stories from the book let's start with one or a good site for a ghost story or a graveyard you got one you I had my not do not disturb the block\nYeah this is an interesting story because it it came to me from the man\nAre involved in the in the story or who is the central character in the story or some some years ago and it stretches all the way back to the to the Nineteen thirties or do you have time for a short yeah reading\nAt home we'd we want we want a little story [noise] well the only goes ... grounded in sweat it as he dug into the naps cemetery plot\nThat held his mother's coughing with each swing of is shovel teddy slowly cleared away\nNearly Thirty years of dirt in stone so that he could move his mother's remains to another
