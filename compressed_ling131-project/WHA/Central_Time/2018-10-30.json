E. dot com\nAnd various levels of education those with a college degree that included bachelors all the way up to a PHD\nAnd of course you had more of those people in college towns like Madison and Milwaukee and then it also looked at other post secondary education associate's degrees and some college so [noise] I'm\nIn all the areas looked at there were three hundred over three hundred metro areas looked at a there was a mismatch between one and thirty two so it varied how much of a difference there was between the applicants knowledge and skills and the jobs available\nRight it seems like those a general trend around the country that are in most cases ah there weren't as many jobs requiring their college degree of there were job seekers or employees having the college degrees that fair to say right\nRight and that that's a problem because people spend a lot of money a lot of time getting an education and there is no assurance that there will be a job waiting when you're completed with your degree\nNow on the other hand there's been a lot of debates along those lines is it worth it to get that degree as we know from other reports the people with the higher levels of education do end up in generally in jobs that pay more right\nRight not only that but I'm the association of public and land grant universities says people with degrees are less likely to be unemployed and they make about a million dollars in additional Irving earnings on average over their lifetime\nWhen entire career so part of what's happening that if I'm doing the math or correctly it must be that to some of these people with a ... just after high school 'cause there's people some college or college degrees are more or ending up in jobs that don't have those requirements are up in those jobs that require a high school or higher education\nAll the pollution involved and you know the production and the transportation a lotta times one garment has multiple facets to it that have to be transported and then brought to the store\nAnd then once you're disposing of it it goes somewhere else which is more transportation a lot of the ... uh countries that are producing stuff have lower environmental standards so those um pollution is going directly into the environment unchecked\nAnd then you think about the waste that we're creating um I have some statistics on the good well\nOne just not right on the north side of Milwaukee they're receiving a hundred and sixty donations a day both large and small I'm ... I was I was shocked to discover they're able to\nProcess eight hundred boxes five by five I'm five foot on they're actually getting rid of those boxes every month and that stuff crushes down to about um six to Eight Belles a day\nWhich each bail is five of those five by five five five by five foot boxes in one and there were fifty bucks and they weigh about a turn and that our local um south western Wisconsin hub is receiving two hundred of those bales a day from our region law\nYeah and a lot of this stuff is ending up in other countries and I think we're really think oh this is charity like it's going to a good place but [noise]\nUm they're trying to create the ban in East Africa on this stuff because it actually is inhibiting their country there are countries from setting up their own any factoring so even the waste part of it not just that it's going in the garbage but\nThat it you know it's not always going to the needy needy or you know they want to start their own production as well so that's just an eye opening\nAnd dug briefly before we move on to sustainable fashion you mentioned are concerned about the labor and I think people have heard maybe vaguely or about the un safe working conditions child labor what kind of things do we see increasingly close when it comes to labor\nAbsolutely um you know I think the biggest shock as the child labor aspect of it which is um obviously fueled by poverty or children are being trafficked from their families and I told that their children will be school down work and sending money back to the family and what happens is the family's never see their children again\nUm some of the statistics are [noise]\nUh there's two hundred and ten million children in forced labor around the world today and not just in clothing but in our home goods and chocolate and coffee\nUm our cell phones and all types of technology mining dangerous jobs um and I used to put that in perspective last I checked there is about two hundred and fifty million\nPeople in the United states so if you can kinda grip get a grip on what that means it would be about four fifths of our population um of people doing this slave labor and nobody really knows about it so\nUm that's definitely an issue and then in fact those child labor jobs are stealing these minimum wage jobs from adults so it's it's additionally feeling more poverty there now what's ...\nLet's talk about the reaction now you and a lot of other people are trying to come up with sustainable alternatives for clothing can you give us a taste for for the range of things people are trying to do\nClothing um I think the first thing is you're voting with your dollar there um\nAnd one way would be to abstain you just um only by what you can use or use what you already have um hold a swap with your neighbors are your friends and then repair the items that you've already got to alter and fit better um I think everybody could probably go through their closet and grab a bag full of stuff that they could fix\nUm another one would be the thrift now you know this whole fast fashion models based on impulse shopping and I think that that is why we have thrift stores so again surfing is great but it also doesn't really change that model of purchasing for us um\nI Would say if you were to get rid of stuff where you were to buy some it's better to do it at faith based organizations usually the ministry of salaries are less\nUm and more of that money is actually going right back into local economies um for example St Vincent de Paul Salvation Army purple hearts um and I guess another way would be to make things you still can buy patterns and either have somebody else make it or I'm making yourself\nAnd uh if you are pointing to shock new there's a ton of resources on line on how to shop\nUm ethical fair trade recycled organic local independent owned\nUm [noise] you know even just a local boutique rather than a big chain\nAnd the power to the Internet is huge um there's a ton of sustainable fashion director he's out there you can follow the brands on Instagram it's really about seeking out these brands because independently will have less of a way to get right in your face and um so they really rely on people who have that interest to come and find them\nAnd when I was a ... a level with you I probably never going to make my own clothing and the world we found out about it wouldn't be pretty if a consumer I wanted to start to try I Would worry over this can be expensive as going to be weird stuff would be for somebody who's not somebody like me you've never done this before or be a good starting to try to\nFind new sustainable quota [noise]\nYeah I think um [noise] you know that's a big barrier in\nThe sustainable fashion world that people think oh it's expensive oh it's wonky is handmade it's not sexy you know it's tree hugger styles or whatever um and uh I think the the best way to get around all that is to just\nYou know get in touch with people who are doing something similar like that um [noise]\nFirst of all I guess I should say the things that are the people are thinking oh it's so expensive but in the reality of it if you spend maybe a little more on something that's going to last longer you know already your dollar is going further um\nAnd I think that's one of the biggest barriers for people is that\nThere is some research on sustainable um marketing and essentially nobody wants to spend more money on sustainable clothing that just don't so that's a\nThat's kind of one thing that that is difficult for marketing to those people but if you think about it right like it's going to go further um you know what happened with my business is that it is made to order so it's essentially um\nA hypothetical business unless somebody were to order something and and as soon as I got to a ground level store I found that people are just begging me to help them with their alterations and they weren't customs stuff and they're willing to pay for it um which is pretty amazing but um again I think\nGetting things altered secondhand because people can buy secondhand and then they bring it into me and say hey I Want the sleeves short under this the shoulders you know with taken and stuff like that it's such a great way for anybody to make something ... them and they love the fabric they noticed\nThey want to change it to make it fit and then they feel good in that so that's really rewarding\nAnd I want to talk a little bit more about what you do at Madame ... you know but not so you started your your main gig here is taking T shirts right obese or to turn\nThem in our new talk about how you do that yeah so I started in two thousand three just\nDoing all kinds of all you know switch ruse and stuff I really got interested in um the puzzle piecing back together of cutting up old um clothing and what I found is that it's really hard to market that stuff online because everything is so unique I'm\nWhat I'm doing is I haven't made to order clothing label and using altered um risk recycled T shirts I'm and I'm practicing zero waste all this crap to recycled into new fabrics via crazy quilting or I'm woman rugs and tapestries\nAnd the reason I chose T shirts as because it's it's reused fibers but there's enough consistency in the fabrics um that I can kind of\nPromise more than one product can create um in volume\nSo if there were somebody be like I Want tendencies in red I'm able to reproduce sat whereas with you know one of the kinds of stuff was found object um fabric ... you know it's been a lot of time like okay let me go out and find this and send you ten pictures and really trying to negotiate with customers about what they want from afar [laughter]\nThis is a way to sort of um streamline that process and still be able to re use I use reuse textile\nDie as a designer and at a coding maker is this fun 'cause it's a fun challenge to our district for the double benefits which\nI Love it oh yeah every project is different and I think you know I'm like I said\nThe gear that's been that I've been driven towards now is a lot more alterations based on just at a local level and I thought you know a lot of artists and today I don't like alterations I hate doing them and it's definitely a mindset it's the same goals that you're reaching with people\nOn you're making them feel good they feel better and their clothing you're saving their clothing you're making it um [noise] you know you're keeping it from the trash or the um you know wherever else it would end up so [noise] uh I think\nI forgot your question but it's it's awesome yes I Love it everyday different every project is different you gotta go really fast and and then you get paid 'cause there's already a demand there unfortunately as a producer you're having to create stuff and then you don't know when you're going to sell it so there's more to do there with the marketing of it\nOr leave it there but not so thanks a lot for joining up to that\nHey absolutely thanks for having me appreciate it\nThat was a fire under joined us from Milwaukee studio earlier today but not for the Milwaukee artist community educator and clothing designer she creates clothing and textiles are all round Madame ... you know what she started a two thousand three far more about her work it matter much you know dot com\nIn many cases their doctors sent them notes sometimes multiple notes urging some sort of a break accommodations you know the ability as I said the ability to carry water around the ability to sit lifting restrictions most importantly\nSo these were you know we talk to doctors who said you know ignoring these notes puts our patients at risk\nTell us a couple of the individual stories you came across at that facility in the Memphis area that's where you are I talked to a lot of people as well looking at legal filings so\nThe story of America have stands out here um hers is a story from twenty fourteen um she had asked again to not lift those boxes weighing forty five pounds each\nShe wanted to be placed in a section of the warehouse where she handled you know sort of envelopes or\nUm paperwork for order something that didn't require that kind of strenuous work she was told\nNo basically because there was a holiday rush in December twenty Thirteen that you know blood into hum January twenty fourteen\nAnd um she was one day\nIn at the end of a shift she rushed to the bathroom she was bleeding through her genes stretching her genes she fainted on her way out of the bathroom she was taken to the hospital and an ambulance where she learned that she had miscarried\nUm we heard from another woman named ... who had two miscarriages while working at this warehouse one in two thousand eight and another one in twenty fourteen that same year under very similar conditions she also collapsed to warehouse floor\nOr in the middle of a shift and later learned that she had lost her baby and these are women who\nI'm In all of these cases both with Erica and chastity very very much um wanted their babies chest that he had bought a baby blanket um you know for her for her baby girl and Erica Hayes was dreaming of raising her kid with her best friend so um it was just it was out early wrenching\nWhat did you hear from the employer and he's\nThe employer uh X. pill logistics um said first of all that they were not running the warehouse in twenty fourteen when some of these incidents happened\nThere was another woman who had a miscarriage more recently um and there were actually two women who have miscarriages more recently and there was also a death on the warehouse for ... was running the warehouse but as to the incidents and twenty fourteen they indicated that those not been reported to\nThem when they purchased the company that owned the warehouse at the time\nUm they also\nAllegations that we made about the warehouse where we're simply untrue um you know but they um they indicated that they'd be investigating um the event the more recent events including the more recent miscarriage\nTalking to Natalie ... from the New York Times She's been reporting on pregnancy discrimination in American workplace is\nStaying with the physical side of the concerns related to pregnancy I'm a job but now it's not just lifting in some cases you talk to women who'd had trouble or because they're required to use a various chemicals for for example for cleaning\nWe yes we've talked to women\nBoth for this most recent story and for a previous story that involved Walmart workers where I'm workers were cleaning\nI'm with you know chemicals that made them feel ill they asked to please not work with those chemicals that were not given a permanent break um you know and\nOne of these women again had a health episode that she tai chi chi carried to term thank God\nBut um she\nFound herself feeling very well and being on accommodated by by Walmart um there are risks for women in a variety of jobs and again that's not to say that pregnant women cannot do this work um but in the cases that we've looked at with high risk pregnancies\nUm it's they have argued they have asked for um temporary adjustments to the work that they're doing\nSome people might hear this and say well why don't they just to find a different jobs I guess that don't have these kind of risks what how did the women talk about their need for these jobs\nYou're supposed to be there you're expecting to to start a family with a

working or I'm I'm while you're pregnant while you're expecting a child is sort of I think anybody would agree that that sort of\nA crazy thought but more importantly and I think is the question that you're getting at what they all said as a to a person how was I supposed to get a job a new job while I was pregnant at you know they've all described the idea of job hunting while pregnant as being\nI'm incredibly hard you know and they were working in many cases low wage um jobs and and um you know they sort of said how was I going to get target or Walmart or someone to take a chance on

two thousand signatures and when I talked to people I've had Democrats independents and Republicans sign my nomination papers and the overwhelming thing that they want to just to have term limits on this position current officeholders held office for forty years\nAnd overall in all parties or a people that signed my papers they want that is my number one goal\nThere was talk about getting rid of

the state treasurer but are these are constitutional officers I'm supposed to be a public servant to the people have spoken and said we want to put these officers to work\nUh I Want to do that or the

the in the United states of America the overwhelming majority of secretary of states are involved in elections so I use that as a\nPrecursor to talking to the legislature and governor to say okay the majority of the states have that let's have that in Wisconsin gimme statutory authority or even a in addition sit on the election commission it's going to be a full time job doing that and then what's important about that is when you have a fraud vote that and the gates your ... your or my vote\nAnd that's why we need to make sure they're all\nA legitimate\nBut some of the former responsibilities

makes us stuff you put in a plastic bag and just much\nA fifty seven percent increase in the incidence can include both hate hate crimes but most of them are non criminal incidents actually enough within this arise\nThey saw a decline in the sauce which which is good news here's what I think's going on if you'll look with respect to anti Semitism Jews are the most warmly regarded faith group in the United states\nYet we saw some increases in hate crime one other thing we seen an increase in anti Semitic content on the darkest corners of the Web and do Thompson did some great research on four chance which we've been fortunate to to use 'em so it depends on what you're looking at\nBut the bottom line is I think we have several things and just bear with me which specific regard to the anti Semitism\nOh in the past fifty years we had the decline in confidence in the communal institutions which held us together and this kind of anti elitism wave which is coming in at the same time we see breathtaking demographic changes in the United states white Christians are no longer a majority\nAnd then we have uh\nSpoke and the emergence of white nationalism one last thing I Am not calling the president a racist or anything like that I Will leave others to analyze that but here's what I Do know is happen\nFor the first time in decades white nationalists have found someone that they believe is speaking their message and we've seen increased activity\nBy these people whether it's public demonstrations which then ebb and flow to a little bit post Charlottesville but we've seen a fragment\nIssue these hate groups so that hornet's nest is broken but these lone wolf hornets are flying around and they're directed by this horrible bigotry that can be found increasingly in our civil political discourse\nTalking to Brian Levin from the center for study of hate and extremism at California State University San\nBernardino about a recent acts of political violence Brian talk more about the Internet we hear a talk of people being radicalized by ISIS on the Internet when it comes to extremist a domestic violence domestic terrorism here in the United states do you see an analogy that\nI I really do it the only thing I Would say is one of the things that everyone has to understand about extremism here most likely to have an extremist asked who lives kind of weird so I you know I I asked Gary live free who's head of the uh University of Maryland's ...\nTerrorism covered the global terrorism database I have some things that you've noticed and when he told me as he said people are acting in your region where they live so so that's something and I think what we've seen with the Internet just like with our socio political there\nHas been a change and that is this fragmentation so not only has the organization of these hate groups change where were they are becoming leaner and meaner and sometimes a really more lawyers who are less joins as hate groups the followers up their message\nAnd as we have this fragmentation the risk\nIncreasingly from these ... loners or or or small groups that are increasingly violent we've seen an escalation in violence in recent weeks that that's a very dangerous conundrum and it's very similar to what we've seen with for instance dice\nWhen al ... to ... when when bin Laden was killed\nHe was upset that these kind of like a loners who are inspired but not trained where we're taking it taking the help and I think we're kind of seen that here in the United states with regard to the most astounding\nForm of extremism right now which is far right wing but we're seeing a rising tide is lifting many ships but the most descendants is the far right wing and the loners jewels or more time in the cells with in those groups are ones we we have to look at it as well\nTalking to Brian Levin right now a professor of criminal justice and director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at California State

I was I was shocked to discover they're able to\nProcess the eight hundred boxes five by five by five foot on they're actually getting rid of those boxes every month and that's just crushes down to about um six to Eight Belles a day\nWhich each male is five of those five by five five five by five foot boxes in one and there were fifty bucks in any way about to turn and then our local um south western Wisconsin hub is receiving two hundred of those bales a day from our reach an awful lot\nYeah and a lot of this stuff is ending up in other countries and I think we're really think oh this is charity like it's going to a good place but [noise]\nUm they're trying to create the ban in East Africa on this stuff because it actually is inhibiting their country there are countries from setting up their own manufacturing so even the waste part of it not just that it's going in the garbage but\nThat it you know it's not always going to the needy needy or you know they want to start their own production as well so that's just an eye opening\nAnd briefly before we move on to sustainable fashion you mentioned are concerned about the labor and I think people have heard vaguely about a safe working conditions child labor what kind of things do we see are increasingly close when it comes to labor\nAbsolutely um you know I think the biggest shock as the child labor aspect of it which is um obviously feel by poverty or children are being trafficked from their families and I told that their children will be school and work and send money back to the family and what happens is the family's never see their children again\nUm some of the statistics are [noise]\nUh there's two hundred and ten million children in forced labor around the world today\nAnd not just in clothing but in our home goods and chocolate and coffee um our cell phones and all types of technology mining dangerous jobs um and I used to put that in perspective last I checked there's about two hundred fifty million\nPeople in the United states so if you can kinda grip get a grip on what that means it would be about four fifths of our population um of people doing this slave labor and nobody really knows about it so\nUm that's definitely an issue and then in fact those child labor jobs are stealing these minimum wage jobs from adults so it's it's additionally feeling more poverty there now let's talk about\nLet's talk about the reaction do you and a lot of other people are trying to come up with sustainable alternatives for clothing can you give us a taste for for the range of things people are trying to do\nYeah so I think to get to do sustainable clothing um I think the first thing is you're voting with your dollar there um\nAnd one way would be to abstain you just um only by what you can use or use what you already have um hold a swap with your neighbors are your friends and then repair the items that you've already got to alter and fit better um I think everybody could probably go through their closet and grab a bag full of stuff that they could fix\nUm another one would be the thrift\nNow you know the whole fast fashion models based on impulse shopping and I think that that is why we have thrift stores so again drifting is great but it also doesn't really change that model of purchasing for us um\nI Would say if you were to get rid of stuff where you were to buy some it's better to do it at faith based organizations usually the ministry of salaries are less\nBack into local economies um for example St Vincent DePaul Salvation Army Purple Heart um [noise] and I guess another way would be to make things you still can buy patterns and either have somebody else make it or I'm making yourself\nAnd uh if you are pointing to shop new there's a ton of resources on line on how to shop\nUm ethical fair trade recycled organic local independent owned\nUm [noise] you know even just local boutique rather than a big chain\nAnd the power to the Internet is huge um there's a ton of sustainable fashion director he's out there you can follow the plans on Instagram it's really about seeking out these brands because independent labels have less of a way to get right in your face and um so they really rely on people who have that interest to come and find them\nIn the home I'll level with you I probably never going to make my own clothing and we'll refer about it wouldn't be pretty if as a consumer I wanted to start to try I Would worry oldest can be expensive is it going to be weird stuff would be for somebody who's not somebody like me you've never done this before or be a good starting point to try to\nFind new sustainable quota [noise] yeah I\nThink um [noise] you know that's a big barrier in\nThe sustainable fashion world that people think oh it's expensive oh it's wonky it's handmade it's not sexy you know it's tree hugger styles or whatever um and uh I think the the best way to get around all that is to just\nYou know get in touch with people who are doing something similar like that um [noise]\nFirst of all I guess I should say the things that are people are thinking oh it's so expensive but in the reality of it if you spend maybe a little more on something that's going to last longer you know already your dollar is going further um\nAnd I think that's one of the biggest barriers for people is that\nThere is some research on sustainable um marketing and essentially nobody wants to spend more money on sustainable clothing that just don't so that's a that's kind of one thing that that is difficult for marketing to those people but if you think about it right like it's going to go further\nUm you know what happened with my business is that it is made to order so it's essentially um\nA hypothetical business unless somebody were to order something and and as soon as I got to a ground level store I found that people are just begging me to help them with their alterations and they weren't customs stuff and they're willing to pay for it um which is pretty amazing but um again I think\nGetting things altered secondhand because people can buy secondhand and then they bring it into me and say hey I Want these sleeves short under this the shoulders you know with taking and stuff like that it's that's a great way\nFor anybody to make something ... them and they love the fabric they know the average gonna last they love it there want to they want to change it to make it fit and then they feel good in that so that's really rewarding\nAnd I want to talk a little bit more about what you do read Madame ... you know enough for you a very respected your your main good here is taking T shirts ripe old these sorts of turning them into a new talk about how you do that yeah so I started in\nThree just doing all kinds of all you know switch ruse on stuff I really got interested in um the puzzle piecing back together of cutting up old um clothing and what I found is that it's really hard to market that stuff online because everything is so unique I'm\nWhat I'm doing is I haven't made toward her clothing label amusing altered um wrist recycled T shirts I'm and I'm practicing zero waste all describes recycled into new fabrics via crazy quilting or I'm moving rugs and ...\nJust because it's it's reused fibers but there's enough consistency in the fabrics um that I can kind of promised\nMore than one product I can create um in volume\nSo if there were somebody be like I Want ten of these in red I'm able to reproduce that whereas with you know one of a kind of stuff was found object um fabrics you know I spend a lot of time like okay let me go out and finance and send you ten pictures and really trying to negotiate with customers about what they want from afar [laughter]\nSo this was a way to sort of um
