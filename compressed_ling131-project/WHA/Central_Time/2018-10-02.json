of mail order homes here in Wisconsin and beyond\nFirst the state legislature will meet for an extraordinary session starting November twelve to consider an incentive package for paper manufacturer Kimberly Clark\nIn January the company announced worldwide cutbacks ultimately then included plans to close plants in Nina and Fox crossing lawmakers backed by Governor Walker put together a state incentive plan to keep those jobs in Wisconsin at least some of them the legislation passed the state assembly in February but still hasn't passed the Senate\nRural white has been following the stories you've WPRI\nTo the show thanks for having me Rob All right so this was announced today this extraordinary session what's supposed to happen at this\nSo the extraordinary session a has been called by Senator Scott Fitzgerald who's the leader of the state Senate and assembly speaker Robin boss who it leads the assembly\nAnd basically what they're saying is lawmakers are going to come back specifically state senators for this Kimberly Clark deal so it can go through committee and then go to the Senate floor and be voted on at that point\nWe talk to you about this before but runs through the basics what is involved in this incentive package\nSo this is a they call it a Foxconn style deal that's what the governor has called that he's the one that proposed that\nThey call it that because it's based on the same um percentages of tax incentives so it would be a Seventeen percent payroll tax credit\nAnd a Fifteen Percent a capital expenditure tax credit which would basically come in the form of a check\nTo Kimberly Clark because of the company doesn't have any tax liability right now based on the state tax code so these are financial incentives the state would pay the company I'm as a motivation to I'm not close their Fox crossing facility which employs about five hundred people\nSpread that's the ... side of the things that benefit the hope for benefit is that at least one of those factories than would stay open an important part of the economy and the Fox news area\nAbsolutely and we have um according to senator Fitzgerald gotten some feedback from the company or lawmakers have that the ... facility is going to close on that employs about a hundred and ten people but the Fox crossing facility which has about five hundred jobs is still up for saving by us incentive package\nWe already had a deadline from Kimberly Clark but said OK\nState lawmakers arrive at a deal by accident I think it would be on the last month right or we're done now are they saying okay we can wait for the ...\n[noise] yes so I spoke with senator Roger Ross this morning and he is the sponsor of the bill that was introduced in the Senate that has uh the governor's proposal in it\nI looked at pictures of views on line in to the untrained eye which means my I I could look at a house and tell you if it was a mail order house or not can you generally walking in a neighborhood look and say oh yeah that's that's one of those\nWell I'll tell you what um if you are able to train your eyes to notice what I call shaky architectural details I um [noise] then you are able to match how is this with their image has been the catalog\nHowever this is not proof that they really are what they look like\nBecause in fact mail order companies were never interested in unique architectural design\nThey weren't interested in selling the maximum number of each model that they published in their cattle dog so what did they say that our art in tech they said what are they buying this year makes them\nAnd so the mail order designs are very close copies of the popular styles from any given year oh though overall no they don't look any different at all but if you care to notice\nThings like you know where does the dorm or is it off the rich poll is it in the middle is down near the IV line if she's chair to notice how many inches a space between the eats than the top the windows for example um this and if you care to estimate the outside to mention\nYou know I'm so so I when we search let me do a physical search what we're looking for is um how's this that match catalog images and every little particular call\nBecause I mean once you get your I trained and once you have a collection of a hundred catalogs to train your eye [laughter] if you're crazy like some of us you can drive up and down streets in cities all over the country you could say oh hey that looks like a garden man tighten house there\nAnd you can write down the address and like model you think it is and um take some pictures and um [noise] and you can go back home and\nFine tune it looking at your pictures in the catalog um [noise] but but and in most cases that's about where we have to start to look for in a larger houses is with the physical street fighting search because\nOnly one of the eight major companies that sold mail order houses still has any of their sales records available\nSo we can just go to war in which doesn't exist anymore actually none of the company's exist anymore except for Sears so he can't go to the earth and say hey give up your sales list of houses they don't have it and so the good starting point is to actually speak as research that\nWe're talking about the history of mail order houses with Rebecca hunter an architectural historian she was researching and writing about mail order houses Rebecca I Want you to take us back to the heyday you sort of the Nineteen twenties suppose I'm a I don't know young factory worker\nSupport for WPRI comes from the Ashland chamber of commerce Ashland county is more than twenty five large outdoor murals painted on buildings throughout the county mural information and fall color updates are available last visit ... dot com\nRather than hiring an architect designing unique home and then hiring a contractor some carpenters to put it up for you um\nCustomers estimate that they saved one third of the cost of traditional building\nBy getting a catalog house how your savings were mostly in labor because the ... channel our cat was this the only difference between those houses and standard construction was that all you're framing board\nThat is that a rise there's the treads the joys you know all of the framing voice skeleton of the house so sports were pretty cut at the mill and so you did not have to pay a carpenter and measuring cut every pork\nSo and then you also because you didn't have to buy standard size lumber and cut it down and you didn't end up with a whole pile of scrap that you paid for and you couldn't use so that that square you save your one third of their cause or whatever it actually came out to eat\nSo I think you would\nYou know you could get some mail order catalogs you could write to Montgomery Ward and say send me your house catalog and you could write to Sears and sent me or house catalog and if she really wanted to go a distance you could write to Gordon men pine investment for Iowa\nOr a lab and company in Bay City Michigan and say hey sent me or catalog\nAnd then you could study all the catalogs and the price things games and the designs and you could pick the house of your dreams and order it\nNow my worry would be a you know sometimes even today when you order stuff by mail you may be end up with a lower quality products no word abuse how ... lower grade or women here than something you might have had constructed locally\nNo they actually were extremely spiritually built well designed top quality materials\nSo um you would not have been disappointed in the quality of your house and your house would still be standing happily today and the I'm much better made than anything is going up currently\nDue you're close to our borders here with Wisconsin do you come up to Wisconsin to do some a mail order house hunting\nOh you bet you know for years Wisconsin has been like playground [laughter] um my son and

lives get married or not and to whom have kids moved to a strange new place for a job started a new radio show change a business strategy these can all be tough choices there are a lot of variables and it's hard to predict the outcomes when we make a big change like that\n[noise] our next guest has some good news he says their strategies and ways of thinking that can help us weigh the options and make better decisions Steven Johnson is the host of the PBS series how we got to now and the podcast American innovation\nHe's the author of eleven books including his latest far cited how we make the decisions that matter the most Steven thanks for joining us today\nWell we've lost even a he was\nWay into a studio I think you can join in by the way it eight hundred six four to one two three four have you made\nA big decision in your life whether to move get married have kids or make a big change of any sort like that tell us your story at eight hundred six four to one two three four that eight hundred six four to one two three four post on the ideas network Facebook page\nUh hypothetically we'll have our guest on in just a moment ah let's see it looks like we may have in the studio now Stephen Hi welcome to the show\nHey how's it going well good so we're we're not talking about decisions here like about what to have for lunch you know the little stuff which cereal to buy you're looking at big life changing decision that are going to shape our lives for years to come what's the difference in our brains that are in the ways we think are between those kinds of decisions well\nYou know it's interesting there's been a lot written over the last ten Fifteen Years ago about are kind of instinctive brain and the kinds of decisions that we make in in you know kind of a flash judgment our guts decisions and things like that\nAnd those it's fascinating the research on that the brain science on that is fascinating um but I think if we look back on our lives and we think about the decisions we make that really ended up changing things for us like the the choices you were just talking about should I take a new job or\nIf it's a business decision should I launch a new product in a completely new market um\nThose are the decisions that really end up shaping you know the course of our of our careers of of our lives and so I wanted with this book to go\nAnd look at what we understood about those decisions in terms of the science really like what what what do we know about how to make them and and can we actually get better can we keep can we teach people to get better at them\nAnd you look at a huge range of decisions from Charles Darwin deciding whether or not to get married to the Obama administration deciding whether to go ahead with the attack that ultimately killed Osama bin Laden took lessons out of the things I Want to start that Darwin example this is something a lot of people might have done he did the traditional\nPro on one side of the list con on the other is that a good strategy for us to use\nThe book starts of that story because it's so funny is like right in the middle of Darwin you know coming up with the theory of natural selection and Eighteen thirty eight in his in his scientific notebook see\nThe votes to kind of facing pages to the pros and cons with that because it kind of not marry and Mary and he writes down all the different options is very funny I kinda reproduce the list in the in the book it's very funny to read that it's a little dated\nBut one of the reason I started with that is\nThat's the one technique that we most people do learn right the pros and cons list um and so in a way it's been you know if Darwin was doing it almost two hundred years ago we really have an advanced [laughter] a lot and in fact there are a lot of other techniques and ... and part of the problem with the pros and cons list is\nBy definition you're looking at a at one alternative\nRight as like should I Do this or not it sometimes you know we call whether or not decisions\nAnd there's a lot of research that shows that um there's a guy name Paul nut who's done a number of different studies of decisions in a in a kind of a business context\nAnd he looked at the way people made their decisions did they have a process\nAnd one of the things he found is that it was very unusual for people to have a part a stage in the decision making process where they actually took out time to try and come up with other alternatives right they were just looking at again it uh whether or not decisions that I Do this or not\nAnd in fact those decisions without that stage of exploring other alternatives ended up being a you know only twenty nine thirty percent of them were ultimately considered to be a success\nBut if people took time at the beginning this is what I call in the in first sighted on the mapping stage of a decision process if they took time to actually explore other alternatives come up with other central\nThey were more likely than not to be happy with the outcome\nSo we limit ourselves if we think of a most of these decisions as yes or no a or B if we if we don't step back and say are these really the only two alternatives\n[noise] you know in a sense that that there's a kind of macro way of describing what I'm arguing for in the book which is that whenever you face one of these truly complex choices I called them full spectrum decisions like they just involved all these different elements or you know in in one choice\nWhat we want to do is go through these exercises that challenge our assumptions that challenge our initial initial assessment of the situation\nExpand all our alternatives [noise] um because it's in the nature of these things to be so complex that we can't perceive them all and we go into them with the kind of too much confidence too much assumption that we understand the situation so you want to at least initially\nAnd if you want to be people I was talking about wanting to be decisive actually in a way what you want to do at the beginning is is hold that the ... for a while while you while you work through all their potential options on the table\nI Want to talk about this in two different settings group and then an individual out looking at a group setting you say that one way to help consider those different options and maybe punch a hole in that initial what seems like a good decision but you haven't thought it through is to have a diverse group of decision makers why is that\nYou know this is one of the recurring findings in in group psychology and behavioral economics and behavioral psychology over the last Twenty years or so that that um that diverse groups make more creative a more insightful\nUh come up with more creative and insightful solutions to problems um so and that diversity can be measured in a lot of different ways there's gender diversity there's you know ethnic diversity but there's also diversity of expertise intellectual background profession [noise]\nWhen you put a group of people together in a room who all think in similar ways and they all have the same the same background in the same kind of cognitive styles\nThey end up falling prey to all the problems of kind of groupthink and overconfidence and confirmation bias and so on and they you know they they kind of they come to an agreement too quickly and that can make for [laughter]\nYou know a a a socially comfortable atmosphere um but it it doesn't always lead to the the best decisions um you need those different perspectives to propose new alternatives or to\nSuggest you know these flaws in the in the decision you're looking at that you might not otherwise she's from the vantage point that you're taking so diversity\nDiversifying the people around you is one of the is one of the key step city you want to take and making a choice like\nThis so that's great for a group or a team decision now what if this is a decision that's just me making it I'm I I I Can't be that diverse I'm just one person how can I I take advantage of that idea of different viewpoints site in one human brain well [laughter]\nAccording again to this one company the buck finger\nThat butter finger doesn't even make the top ten list nationally number two in Wisconsin ... number three hot tamales\nNow on the ... top that isn't mentioned Skittles number one ... I can see that Snickers Reese's peanut butter cops locks in at number four now that's the number one in my household and there's always a quandary\nOr every year when we buy Halloween candy to give

Y. dentistry dot com\n[noise]\nThrough a single central time here on the ideas network I'm Rob ... coming up since Nineteen eighty two banned book week I've taken place to support the expression of ideas\nEven those considered out of the ordinary are unpopular we'll talk to the director of the American library association office for intellectual freedom now Congress has approved a bill but it's been called the biggest overhauled the music copyright law in years it's called the music modernization act and it could mean big changes for songwriters and music streaming sites\nThe bill as broad support for many in the music industry including artist like Smokey Robinson who raised the changes it makes to the payment of artist here you speaking before Congress in may\nIf we stopped paying people because suddenly music well that's that's ludicrous because of the fact that their time and effort and creativity into creating this music that people are getting pleasure from listening to and having for ever and ever\nAmy weighing as a reporter who covers the music and media industries that Rolling Stone Amy thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me well if I had one word to describe our music copyright system it would be complicated can you talk about what the state of the art is right now prior to this bill\nThat is extremely truth so\nThe way that music copyright works right now I Can't even be explained it in a sentence or a paragraph because there's so many different rules that govern different entities for instance the way the artist get paid from radio like we're listening to your right now it's completely different from the way I just get paid from a song coming through your local grocery store speaker system\nAnd the bill really does a lot to bring that together for the modern age but it still isn't you know a cure all doesn't establish one central system for artist you get paid it just helps them sorted out the kinks that had been in the system for a while\nAnd one big change the system of course in recent years is just bought a fire Pandora and are streaming radio at all these things were they kind of gray areas\nThat's exactly right they weren't necessarily gray areas for artists because artists know how much they should be paid and they're very vocal about it that for services setting up like something like ... and music streaming service\nThere is really no way to get all the music at once\nYou have to either go to every individual rights holder every label every artist and that system and say let's make a deal for your music or you can just put all of it on there and get sued so they may think one of the nation act helps with creating a central authority for that to happen so that on the spot if I side of things\nThere okay to just get all that music and on the artist side of things they can actually get paid who\nAll gets paid I mean there's obviously the performer but they're not the only one who might get a ... or ... of a of a song who always is out there mhm\nSo when you listen to a song you might think that the money just goes to the artists and sometimes you think about the record label but in fact that's only half the equation it's the artist the record label and by the way they are also producers and co writers coauthors of that song or singing maybe a chorus or hook or something\nOnly means that the federal government so that they can't come in or can be printed there are many kinds of banning and there are many kinds of governments [noise] so our contention is this\nAnybody can challenge a book on our challenge isn't just complaining about it the thing that we think that the school library or a public library book should be restricted meaning it should be harder to get to where it should be removed altogether and if it's just challenge and that happens a lot in America and that's fine it's okay for people to challenge things\nBut one book was removed a government entity\nSo we're talking about a school the republic library university is making a decision to remove that book from somebody and before we say well that's you know it's still available elsewhere [noise] many if the book so to come under challenge most frequently are kind of aimed at\nYoung people who are dealing with a sometimes difficult issues and so as I say if you're a teen ... you know and you're gay you don't know the book was there if you're somebody complained about it the school library pulled most of the libraries in America are pretty small rural areas\nThat teenager doesn't have a credit card to go to Amazon they don't have a license to drive to the bookstore that's a town over and so what that means is these decisions to remove books have real consequences for people\nNot libraries are curated they can't have obviously all the books in the world can you talk about what happens in that process than when someone in the community says I Want to challenge this book I don't think you said ... I don't think you should have it as part of your collection\nOkay and again I'm complaining about books almost as much fun as reading about them so uh so that part's okay so when someone comes in there so you know this book should be restricted or move and we say\nOkay we have a process that we follow the librarians called request for reconsideration and what that means is that instead of just a knee jerk responses so what you found a bad word on pitch Seventeen\nWe sit down and look at the material selection policy that was used to go up and what we bought in the first place then usually a committee has put together that represents various different perspectives and groups and then they sit down and read the entirety of the book that is very\nAnd then sit down and say how does that fit with our policy and do we believe that it should be retrain retain restricted or removed and won it follows like that then they say okay we make a recommendation than to the administrator could be a library director and\nIf someone disagrees with that then and there could be an appeal that goes to a governing body so a school board or library board and after that it's final\nLet's talk about that mental op you mentioned restricted did not an either or but but how would that work if somebody says okay we're fine with having the in the library we don't want it as accessible to kids under age I don't know wild\nWell my story but that one goes back to when I was a kid and I was I was fourteen years old and I had just for the first time and I went to look up some of the stuff and so I being a good library user and went to the card catalogue and looked up the word sex and there really was a headache and my public library said for sex see librarian\nAnd what I loved about that you know that's ... could have been a potentially very popular service but in fact what it meant was you go to the library and say I'm looking for this book but of course you very nervous when you do something like that and then there was a special location somewhere on the back room or under the desk or somewhere hidden\nWell what we've learned is librarian said special collections are basically hidden collections\nNobody asks for them nobody used them it's like buying the book and putting it on box it doesn't\nDoesn't serve a purpose\nThat a parent might say okay I don't want my ... my fourteen year old great my five year old they're maybe not ready I I think as a parent for some of the material how do you a display it so that maybe that fourteen year old can get to where the five year old doesn't stumbled onto it\nWell libraries have always had\nSections within the building that kind of are targeted to specific ages so if you're a you know a preschooler or somewhere between the ages of three and seven or eight you're hanging out in the juvenile picture book area and easy readers it's not on the same location within the library\nAnd I think that uh the other thing that we should remember is the first I don't think that children can read too much I really don't and I also think that if you're five years old you're not interested in things that a fourteen year old is is interested in you're not going to pick up the book and read it\nTalking to Jamie ... director of the American library association office for intellectual freedom it's a banned book wheat and Jamie let's get into some of the most commonly challenged the books of of last year I was reading your twenty Seventeen a one that's come up I I assume because of the I think of the Netflix series\nThirteen reasons why by Jay amateur and you talk about that\nYeah sure kinda when it first came out in two thousand seven and I should say the topic of the book is suicide in high school so it main character commit suicide and the rest of the book kind of goes through so why did she do that to know all the people who were involved in that decision [noise]\nSo when it came out in two thousand Seventeen a lot of school administrators and superintendents and principals pulled the book before anybody even asked for it and that's because there is a justifiable concern\nUm sometimes we have a suicides in schools and they become almost contagious and so the administrators are very worried about that but then librarians were set up and they said well the reason we bought this because there are children who are dealing with us we have people in our high school and at least this gives us a way to say that you're not alone and we can talk about it and their resources that we can make available\nTo you [noise] well when the\nNetflix series came out the book again was child is so big a surge and the challenges to it [noise] even though the book and the Netflix series of very different in the book the girl who killed herself does it by taking sleeping pills and and the\nSeries it's more graphic there's a razor blade involved and so once again we find that in those places where there was no librarian the worried\nSupport for WNPR comes from the University of Wisconsin stout offering on line undergraduate and graduate degrees and professional education as it did they get options were adult learners Yu W. W. dot edu slashed WNPR\nUm catalogue to say if you are thinking about this and these are resources and so of course librarians feel that a a weird defenders of the right to inquire and be rather than just silence people who are saying things we don't want to hear we think the more speeches better than less speech\nSilence there's nobody and sometimes speaking can save a life\nA couple of other books on the challenge west I Am jazz by Jessica hurtful and jazz a jazz Jennings I'm Sorry and George by Alex Gino both deal with gender identity can you talk about why these are constantly challenged\nYeah in fact fifty percent of the books that were challenged in two thousand Seventeen fall into elegy beauty you know one of the things I often believe is the one we roll off this list every year and go back and tell me all the challenges that have been reported to us [laughter] it's kind of a snapshot of what mainstream America is worried about this here\nAnd so algae beauty has been in the news quite a lot and so the fairly small smattering of books that have been done to be published and show up in libraries are getting some significant pushback\nAnother one anti Thomas's has gotten a lot of attention lately the heat you get a ... a different category I think I had to deal with racial issues\n[noise] yeah this is one in fact I Believe in movies is coming out about it and it's about a young black girl who sees a friend of hers get shot by the police and so she works through 'em and I think a very interesting way to say this is the experience from the police side of it\nFrom the high school side of it from the white side of it from the black side of it\nAnd it's a powerful and moving story\nAnd a couple of recurring titled don't seem to come up year after year I'll throw out a few of them not to kill a mocking bird the Kite Runner and absolutely true diary of a hard time Indian why do some books like that that come up again and again with challenges over the years\nYou know sometimes a blue for the best definition we have the classic of something that irritates one generation after another and by that I mean it says something powerful and significant to the next us uncomfortable\nAnd so like we absolutely true diary of a part time Indian talks about the real difficulties faced by Native Americans of growing up in a culture that um has almost destroyed theirs the Kite Runner talks about the very difficult issue of uh\n[noise] you know conflict between cultures and uh and sexual violence and its effect on young people\nSo it's a killer a mocking bird deals with race which is something that America continues to grapple with so I think that um it's not surprising\nFor the book would wind up being banned are also on the cult classic lifts\nOur library program sometimes challenged department or the materials themselves\n[noise] yeah we're actually starting to see quite a shift in the landscape of libraries that used to be it was just books and now it's a displays and ironically off the displays challenged are banned books week displays or someone will come in and say you know that book there that's really offensive I understand that you have to have it but just don't show it to anybody\n[noise] or we have challenges that are done to speakers not even necessarily library programs but\nSomeone in the community might say I want to do a program that has to do with um [noise] um you know the connection between autism and vaccinations and so someone will push back and say well the libraries permit that to happen [noise] so um we live in an increasingly ... times I Believe\nWe both are with a message to uh people who use their libraries around the country why banned book week is important\n[noise] let's remember that the first amendment is all about our individual right to inquire is our rights to learn as we look around the world\nReading too much isn't one of them the more kids read more parents are going to be for life and the more the kitchen at an adult to talk about those books together to better understand each other\nBut we do still have choices and those choices can make all the difference between parts of the world that will become uninhabitable including along the coastline here in the U.S\nA or places in the southwest that we'll see worsening heat waves and places that might be saved if we are to limit a temperature increases\nThese Homs will grow exponentially as temperatures rise there are also some dangerous feedback loops that start to kick in at higher temperatures we'll see run away ice sheets last which will contribute to really catastrophic sea level rise\nOr we could see a changes and ... smell thing ah ocean acidification which can really affect our of fish and ecosystems in the ocean\nSo these are the kinds of impacts that we want to do our best to avoid and we still have a chance of limiting some of these worst impacts\nTalking to Rachel you're just one of the universe a union excuse me of Concerned Scientists talk about climate change a report out from the Trump Administration are predicts a seven degree increase that's Fahrenheit by the end of the century\nOr budge says a particular policy change your economy standard increases more strict standards wouldn't make a big enough different\nAnd reach was returned to policies let's start with this one what kind of impact and fuel economy standards have on greenhouse gas emissions\nWell fuel economy standards are critical to lower\nStores all of a heat trapping a missions in the U.S so it's\nIt's a really important factor of the economy that we have to uh try to limit emissions from and diesel very sensible standards uh that had been agreed to\nThese standards that both the industry and uh environmental groups\nSupported they were ... not just going to help limit emissions from the sexual but we're also going to create a generation of cars that that would be safer or more of fuel efficient that would uh pay consumers back in their pocket both in terms of saving fuel cost\nSo there are lots of good reasons to implement these standards and the trouble is should be seen for what it is it is a cynical ploy to prop up fossil fuel and Chris this is not serving the interests of the American public\nUm do you use a vehicle efficiency standards were widely accepted appreciate it they were going into effect and now just like across the board a cross climate policy\nThis administration is turning back the clock whether it's a power plant carbon standards vehicle efficiency standards or standards to limit me saying emissions which are also a highly both and a heat trapping gas from the oil and gas industry\nYou'd mentioned power plant emissions and that's been another big change from the Obama administration to the Trump Administration can you talk about what's changed in the last couple of years\nWell what has changed unfortunately is that a false will feel interests have uh given marching orders are to the administration the administration has appointed at the very highest levels of agencies like the EPA\nFolks who really are doing the bidding of these folks will feel interest they're not looking out\nFor the mission of the agency which is to protect\nPublic health and wellbeing that\nIs what the ... mission is and climate change is posing such significant a I'm a problems to our economy not just a in dollar terms that harm to people ah that it's it's really an abdication of the agencies duty to the American public to\nSee it rolls back a standard up to standard\nOf these protective standards deliver not just a cuts in heat trapping emissions they also deliver a lot of public health benefits from producing coal pollutants like mercury I'm a ... nitrogen oxide so for all sides of particulate\nMatter all of which caused a huge public health burden to Americans so we're seeing them ruled back every national climate and clean energy policy uh we have a and that is really a very sad a very dangerous um set of actions\nA big argument from the Trump Administration and others is that some of these climate change related regulations or were hurting the economy or would hurt the economy or whether it started terms of more expensive cars more expensive energy or what do you see those concerns\nThese are completely ... tourists arguments that there there is such a you know they're they're they're the opposite of what is actually happening so if you look at the power sector for example\nWhat we're seeing in the marketplace is that Keno forms of energy like solar wind or even natural gas a winning out against a cold\nThey're winning out in the market place because they're they're cheaper um they're cleaner they're more desirable people are are really embracing utilities and consumers are embracing these new forms of energy\nSo in a desperate attempt to prop up coal ah they're now trying to float these ideas of bailouts\nUm this is just you know it's so blatantly ah against what flit ... in terms of moving towards that clean energy economy that's really important to recognize that uh that that ... the actions are taking a across the board and\nThen the rationale for them a fill in the this is not about the economy because the economy is try they even as we're moving to these K. no phones of energy\nFor talking to Rachel quit is right now policy director for the climate and energy program for the union of Concerned Scientists she's with us to talk about a recent report from the Trump Administration that acknowledges that temperatures are rising globally will rise a probably over the next eighty years about argues against particular forms of action to stop that\nYou can join in at

and entire new wardrobe of clothing delivered\nTo your home without a lot of hassle but starting back in the early Nineteen hundreds you could order entire house to be delivered in parts of visas will talk to an architectural historian about the history of mail order homes here in Wisconsin and beyond\nFirst the state legislature will meet for an extraordinary sessions starting November twelve to consider an incentive package for paper manufacturer Kimberly Clark\nIn January the company announced worldwide cutbacks ultimately that included plans to close plants in Nina and Fox crossing\nLawmakers backed by Governor Walker put together a state incentive plan to keep those jobs in Wisconsin at least some of them\nThe legislation passed the state assembly in February but still hasn't passed the Senate or all white has been following the story she's WPRI state Capitol reporter Laurel welcome back to the show thanks for having me around All right so this was announced today this extraordinary session what's supposed to happen at this\nSo the extraordinary session at has been called by Senator Scott Fitzgerald he's the leader of the state Senate and assembly speaker Robin boss who leads the assembly and basically what they're saying as lawmakers are going to come back specifically state senators for this Kimberly Clark deal\nSo it can go to your committee and then go to the Senate floor and be voted on at that point\nWe talk to you about this before but runs through the basics what is involved in this incentive package\nSo this is a they call it a Foxconn style deal that's what the governor has called ... he's the one that propose that they call it that because it's based on this saying uh\nSo it would be a Seventeen percent payroll tax credit\nAnd a Fifteen Percent a capital expenditure tax credit\nWhich would basically come in the form of a check to Kimberly Clark because the company doesn't have any tax liability right now based on the state tax code\nSo these are financial incentives to state would pay the company I'm as a motivation to I'm not close their Fox crossing facility which employs about five hundred people\nSpread that's the cost side of things that benefit the hope for benefit is that at least one of those factories then would stay open an important part of the economy and the Fox news area\nAbsolutely and we have um according to senator Fitzgerald gotten some feedback from the company or lawmakers have that the ... facility is\nGoing to close on that employs about a hundred and ten people but the Fox crossing facility which has about five hundred jobs is still up for saving by this incentive package\nWe already had a deadline from Kimberly Clark that said okay state lawmakers arrive at a deal by accident I think would be on the last month right or we're done now are they saying okay we can wait for the special\n[noise] yes so I spoke with senator Roger Ross this morning and he is the sponsor of the bill that was introduced in the Senate that has uh the governor's proposal in it and he said that they've had ongoing discussions with Kimberly Clark they reached out to the company as lawmakers and said\nI looked at pictures of these on line in to the untrained eye which means my I I couldn't look at a house and tell you if it was a mail order house or not can you generally walking in a neighborhood look and say oh yeah that's that's one of those\nWell I'll tell you what if you are able to train\nThe architectural details I um [noise] then you are able to match how has this with their image has been a catalog however this is not proof that they really are what they look like\nBecause in fact mail order companies were never interested in unique architectural design\nThey weren't interested in selling the maximum number of each model that they've published in their cattle dog so what did they say to their architects they said what are they buying this year makes them\nAnd so the mail order designs are very close copies of the popular styles from any given year oh though overall no they don't look any different at all\nBut if you care to notice things like you know where does the dorm or is it off the rich poll is it in the middle is uh down near the beach line if she chaired a notice how many inches a space between the eats than the top the wind up with for example\nUm this and if you care to estimate the outside to mention\nYou know I'm so so I when we search let me do a physical search what we're looking for is um how's this that match catalog ranges and every little particular call\nBecause I mean once you get your I trained and once you have a collection of one hundred catalogs to train your eye [laughter] as you're crazy like some of us you can drive up and down streets in cities all over the country and you could say oh hey that looks like a garden men tighten house there\nAnd you can write down the address and ... model you think it is and um take some pictures and um [noise] and you can go back home and\nFine tune it looking at your pictures and catalogs um [noise] but but and in most cases that's about where we have to start with for mental or houses is with the ... street fights and be searched because\nOnly one of the eight major companies that sold mail order houses\nStill has any of their sales records available so we can't just go to war in which doesn't exist anymore actually none of the company's exist anymore except for the years that we can't go to the earth and say hey give up your sales list of houses\nFederal habits and so that good starting point is to actually speak I researched as\nWe're talking about the history of mail order houses with Rebecca hunter an architectural historian she was researching and writing about mail order houses Rebecca I Want you to take us back to the he said it was the Nineteen twenties suppose I'm a I don't know young factory worker\nOr just moved to el ... and I found a plot of land I Want to order house what do I do\nWell you've heard from your neighbors who are very happy with her male or a tree houses that um\nThey saved a whole bunch of money by ordering a pre cut kids rather than hiring an architect designer unique home and then hiring a contractor some carpenters to put it up for you um\nCustomers estimate that they saved one third of the cost of traditional building by getting a catalog house how your savings were mostly in labor because the pre cut channel our cat was the only difference between those houses and standard construction\nWas that all year framing board\nThat is that the rise there's the treads the joy you know all of the framing voice skeleton of the house so sports were pretty cut at the mill\nTo pay a carpenter to measure and cut every fork\nSo and then you also because you didn't have to buy standard size lumber and cut it down you didn't end up with a whole pile of scrap that you paid for and you couldn't use so that that is where you saved your one third of their cause or whatever it actually came out to eat\nSo I think he would\nYou know you could get some mail order catalogs you could write to Montgomery Ward and say send me your house catalog can you could write to Sears and send me or house catalog and\nIf she really wanted to go a distance you could write to Gordon meant pine in Davenport, Iowa or a lab and company in Bay City Michigan and say hey send me or catalog and then you could study all the catalog and the pricing schemes than\nThe designs and you could take the house of your dreams and order it\nNow my worry would be a you know sometimes even today when you order stuff by mail you may be ended up with a lower quality product a word abuse how the lower grade or

lives get married or not and two of whom have kids moved to a strange new place for a job started a new radio show change a business strategy these can all be tough choices there are a lot of variables and it's hard to predict the outcomes and we make a big change like that [noise]\nOur next guest has some good news he says there are strategies and ways of thinking that can help us weigh the options and make better decisions\nSteven Johnson is the host of the PBS series how we got to now and the podcast American innovation he's the author of eleven books including his latest far cited how we make the decisions that matter the most Steven thanks for joining us today\n\nWe've lost even a he was on his way into a studio I think\nYou can join in by the way it eight hundred six four to one two three four have you made a big decision like this in your life how did you a way the different options be interested in hearing your story did you make a list of pros and cons\nDid you end up ignoring that list or did it work for you what kind of strategies do you use when you make a big decision in your life whether to move get married have kids\nOr make a big change of any sort like that tell us your story at eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four to one two three four post on the ideas network Facebook page\nUh hypothetically we'll have our guest on and just a moment ah let's see it looks like we may have in the studio now Stephen Hi welcome to the show\nHey how's it going well good so we're we're not talking about decisions here like about what to have for lunch you know the little stuff which cereal to buy you're looking at big life changing decision that are going to shape our lives for years to come what's the difference in our brains that are in a way we think of between those kinds of decisions well you know it's interesting\nTen Fifteen Years ago about are kind of instinctive brain and the kinds of decisions we make in in you know kind of a flash judgment are got decisions and things like that\nAnd those it's fascinating the research on that the brain science on that is fascinating um but I think if we look back on our lives and we think about the decisions we make that really ended up changing things for us like the the choices you were just talking about should I take a new job or\nIf it's a business decision should I launch a new product in a completely new market um [noise]\nThose are the decisions that really end up shaping the course of our of our careers of of our lives and so I wanted with this book to go\nAnd look at what we understood about those decisions in terms of the science really like what what what do we know about how to make them and and can we actually get better can we can we teach people to get better at them\nAnd you look at a huge range of decisions from Charles Darwin deciding whether or not to get married or to the Obama administration deciding whether to go ahead with the attack that ultimately killed Osama bin Laden took lessons out of those things I Want to start started that Darwin example this is something a lot of people might have done he did the traditional\nPro on one side of the list con on the other is that a good strategy for us to use\nThe book kind of starts to that story because it's so funny it's like right in the middle of Darwin you know coming up with a theory of natural selection and Eighteen thirty eight in his in his scientific notebook seats\nThe votes to kind of facing pages to the pros and cons I said because it kind of not marry and Mary and he writes down all the different options is very funny I kinda reproduce the list in the in the book it's very funny to rebounds a little dated\nBut one of the reason I started with that is\nThat's the one technique that we most people do learn right the pros and cons list um and so in a way it's been you know if Darwin was doing it almost two hundred years ago we really haven't advanced [laughter] a lot and in fact there are a lot of other techniques and ... and part of the problem with the pros and cons list is\nBy definition you're looking at a at one alternative\nRight as like should I Do this or not it's sometimes you know we call whether or not decision and there's a lot of research that shows that um there's a guy name Paul nut who's done a number of different studies of decisions in a in a kind of a business context [noise]\nAnd he looked at the way people made their decisions did they have a process\nAnd one of the things he found is that it was very unusual for people to have a part a stage in the decision making process where they actually took out time to try and come up with other alternatives right they were just looking at again it uh whether or not decisions that I Do this or not\nAnd in fact those decisions without that stage of exploring other alternatives ended up being\nA you know only twenty nine thirty percent of them were ultimately considered to be a success but if people took time at the beginning this is what I call in the in first sighted on the mapping stage of a decision process if they took time to actually explore other alternatives come up with other potential past they might take\nThey were they were more likely than not to be happy with the outcome\nSo we limit ourselves if we think of most of the decisions as yes or no a or B if we if we don't step back and say are these really the only two alternatives\n[noise] you know in a sense that that there's a kind of macro way of describing what I'm arguing for in the book which is that whenever you face one of these truly complex choices I called them full spectrum decisions like they just involved all these different elements or you know in in one choice\nWhat we want to do is go through these exercises that challenge our assumptions that challenge our initial initial assessment of the situation\nExpand all our alternatives [noise] um because it's in the nature of this\nIf too much confidence too much assumption that we understand the situation so you want to at least initially and if you want to be people I was talking about wanting to be decisive actually in a way what you want to do at the beginning is is hold that decisive innocent check for a while while you while you work through all their potential options on the table\nI Want to talk about this in two different settings group and then an individual out looking at a group setting you say that one way to help consider those different options and maybe punch a hole in that initial what seems like a good decision but you haven't thought it through is to have a diverse group of decision makers why is that\nYou know this is one of the recurring findings and in group psychology and behavioral economics and behavioral psychology over the last Twenty years or so that that um that diverse groups make more creative a more insightful\nUh come up with more creative and insightful solutions to problems um so and that diversity can be measured in a lot of different ways there's gender diversity there's you know ethnic diversity but there's also diversity of expertise intellectual background profession\nWhen you put a group of people together in a room who all\nThink in similar ways and they all have the same the same background and the same kind of cognitive styles they end up falling prey to all of the problems of kind of groupthink and overconfidence and confirmation bias and so on and they you know they they kind of they come to an agreement too quickly and that can make for [laughter]\nYou know a a a socially comfortable atmosphere um but it it doesn't always lead to the the best decisions um you need those different perspectives to propose new alternatives or to\nSuggest you know these flaws in the in the decision you're looking at that you might not otherwise see from the vantage point that you're taking so diversity\nDiversifying the people around you it's one of the is one of the key steps that you want to take and making a choice like this\nSo that's great for a group or a team decision now what if this is a decision that's just me making it I'm I I I Can't be that diverse I'm just one person how can I I take advantage of that idea of different viewpoints site in one human brain well
