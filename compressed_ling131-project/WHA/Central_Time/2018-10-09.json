familiar with the idea of gene being passed vertical\nFrom parents the children but scientists have discovered the genes can move in many more directions even between species\nWe'll find out more from the author of the new book the tangled tree first a new report from the United nations lays out the potential consequences if global temperatures rise by more than one and a half degrees Celsius\nNot good more heat waves more flooding and bigger snowfall is higher sea levels agricultural damage even the displacement of millions of people\nScientists say keeping global temps from rising that much is a daunting task in fact one of the report's authors says it would require on President of changes and we only have according to the report a dozen or so years to figure it out [noise] Christmas\nImposed he's written books on climate and science Chris welcome to central time\nTo be with you\nWell we've heard lots of warnings on over the years some national groups of science y a scientist what stands out to you Chris from this particular warning\nWell they really look this time at the near term now where we're going to be at the end of the century but what's gonna happen in the next couple of decades and what the researchers have basically said is that there's no sign we're on track\nThe world is on track to limit warming two one five degrees Celsius\nWe don't even know if we could do it because it's the kind of transition required to be quote unprecedented in in human history um but since we're not there yet it's maybe still possible uh that's kind of the the verdict\nOn the consequences side before we spend time on what could be done to hold it to that one and a half degrees Celsius or one and a half degrees Celsius is still a pretty significant change a lot could happen with that what are they worried about if we see to that level\nBullets to point seven degrees Fahrenheit and ... so that you know so it's it's one one ... that makes it sound maybe a little smaller than it is 'cause itself the U.S and we're already at one Celsius so one point eight Fahrenheit and\nThat's the rise since the since the late Nineteen century so one of the most striking and there's many many impacts that scientists are now able to discern\nOne is that you would be moving into a world where one of the fundamental ecosystems of the planet\nCoral reefs are they have been like into the rain forest to see\nIt they might basically be almost gone at one point five degrees Celsius so that's pretty striking an entire ecosystem that is just you know kind of defines the tropics that tropical belt adult planet um that's one of the most striking in fact there are many many others\nAnd the risk of the displacement of millions of people I mean we hear political stories about immigrants and refugees are causing the issue of refugees causing political turmoil and a lot of countries around the world climate change could make a lot more of that happened and it sounds like they're saying\nWell certainly um weather extremes um will be worse and so we'll heat extremes and that's something that has the temperature increases these things you do your risk of these things increases I'm In this you know we're already seeing at one point five seat would be worse than where we are now to see what the worse than that\nA group of creatures that had been taken for bacteria small single celled simple a internal structure creatures microbes um but that uh when considered under his methods of sequencing genomes very early genome sequencing\nRoute revealed themselves to be not bacteria at all and in fact more different from bacteria than they are from us than they are from the the uh the limb of the tree of life that includes all complex creatures\nAnimals plants fun guy et cetera these things are now known as archaea because there are thought to be perhaps related to the oldest forms of life on earth but there was discovered by car was a third kingdom of life and that was sort of the opening shot in this revolution I described in the book\nAnd part of that revolution is this new way this new technology that but St Charles Darwin wouldn't have had handy forum where we can read and we can do it in a more effectively and cheaply we can read DNA I dig down to the molecules talk about how that's a sad thing out of the way we do evolution\nThat's right it's this whole new field of science with the fancy name molecular file a genetics and essentially what that means is sequencing genome sequencing the DNA and in some cases are in a within living organisms and then comparing those sequences\nBetween different organisms to see who is how closely related to who else and how far back in time the or the divergence of different lineages go but in doing that scientist\nAlso started to discover that there were genes moving sideways not just vertically through the lens of the tree of life\nTalking to David Quammen about his new book tangled tree a radical new history of life you speaking of the Wisconsin book festival this Thursday at six at the discovery building in Madison\nLet's dig into that idea you're just dropped on his David my understanding of genetics is I get my genes from my parents and then they get them from their parents and so on and that's how I got most of my genes right by writers or they call them inside football the lateral and happening in the genetic world\nThere is this phenomenon that scientists call horizontal gene transfer genes moving sideways across species boundaries even across boundaries between kingdoms\nOf life or this is supposed to be impossible I'd written three or four earlier books on evolution and I thought I knew a couple of good reasons why it was impossible but it turns out it is possible it's not easy it's not frequent\nExcept among bacteria and archaea it happens very rapidly among them genes moving sideways but it happens also in higher creatures so that we humans contain some stretches of DNA that have come to us\nSideways from bacteria and sizable stretches of DNA that have come to us\nSideways from viruses in the course of viral infections that have gotten into into the germ line into the reproductive cells into the ovaries and test these if humans and been passed down eight percent of our genomes we now know consist of viral DNA acquired\nAlong the way it could have a virus pop new genes into them and they pass them down to their kids is not just in a skin cell or southern get actually has passed on to future generations\nThat's right retroviruses which\nWhich insert their DNA into the genomes of the cells they in fact\nI'm In a in the case of HIV they infect immune cells and we call that aids but if they infect reproductive cells and not just the immune cells in the blood if they infect eggs and sperm than they can patch their DNA into the DNA that is passed along to offspring and that has happened\nUm enough time so that our our genomes as I say now consist of about eight percent viral ... DNA required sideways\nNow as this affects a losing the weight Darwin presented it one way it sounds to me like it could account for more variation right 'cause all we thought of earlier was okay genes mutate and then get past the natural selection works on them this is another mechanism for a species that new genes to be subject to natural selection right\nThat's exactly right and that's important these new discoveries don't overturn Darwin but they add to Darwinian theory of evolution by a a revealing that the that a mutation is not the only source of innovation in genomes\nIt doesn't just happen by incremental changes when DNA copies itself inaccurately by one letter or a few letters innovation can also come into a genome in huge lumps in quanta in whole genes and stretches a packets of genes\nComing in sideways by horizontal gene transfer and providing new innovation new material on which Darwinian natural selection acts\nYou mentioned that bacteria are more prone to do this horizontal stop this horizontal gene transfer for bacteria that causes diseases is this something that makes them or something we worry about more\nThis is vastly important when it comes to the matter of disease causing bacteria because we now realize that this whole problem that everybody has heard about an antibiotic resistant bacteria things like MRSA\nThe killer bugs that you can't you can't kill with um with the antibiotics that we have\nWe now realize that uh was single strain of bacteria may acquire its resistance to a certain antibiotic gradually by incremental mutation\nBut once acquired it can pass the gene for that resistance\nSideways to a completely different kind of bacterium from ... to ... to ... to salmonella packets of resistance conferring genes\nMoving sideways instantly from one kind of bacteria into another and that's why antibiotic resistance has spread around the world so\nSo quickly and is now killing tens of thousands of people every year\nAll right that's disturbing I Want to bring things back to the family tree now\nI it sounds like usually if we did genetic testing of humans we'd figure out if we test and most of our genes we'd find oh our cousins the chimpanzees and orangutans are pretty close to them further from other primates and so on down the line\nBut if we pick the a particular gene I might say it might look like are closely related to I don't know must grab her a pumpkin or something if those particular genes got transferred over\nOr a bacterium yes yes it probably not pumpkin Rick Perry counterintuitive a it's a it's less likely that is a pumpkin here for a bacterium to get some DNA into our genome than it is for a pumpkin\nAll right but does this can muddy the waters as we are trying to map that family tree out if there are there this strange stuff in there\nWhat this reveals is that the shape of the history of life is not just shaped like a tree with limbs and branches diverging diverging diverging but that in some cases limbs and branches converge\nMoving sideways one imagine one branch moving sideways flowing into another branch and carrying it sapped into that other branch we now realize that that's what the the quote unquote tree of life looks like\nNow this middle molecular silo genetics you're talking about it's a made a lot of discoveries already bought in the world the science is is pretty new stuff what are you watching for on the frontiers of this now\nWell we're learning more and more about the now that we have the human genome sequence more and more about where all of the DNA three point two billion letters of DNA and our genomes where it came from we're learning more about human identity of course we're learning more about issues\nOf human health but we're also learning about our own deepest history we're learning that we humans\nAre we think of ourselves as individuals but in fact we are mosaics we contain some ancestry from bacteria some ancestry from viruses some ancestry of course from\nOther primates and so it binds us even more closely to the rest of the natural world it's humbling but I think it's also majestic an exhilarating to to get this dawning new understanding of our human identities\nIn a broader perspective of how we think of science so you mentioned earlier that you've written books that assumed this stuff could happen does this say kind of reinforce the idea that science is is a process it's not a set of facts to memorize from a textbook but it's this living thing that we're doing all the time\nAbsolutely sciences discovery science is hypothesized ... testing\nScience is empirically supported theories but it's also competition and ambition and insecurity and uh um other moments its its drinking beer and the court orders of hotels during conferences that's a very human process and\nAnd and looking at it as I tried to in this book\nReminds us that even the biggest of ideas or work in progress that's part of the ethic and the ethos of science that we make these discoveries we support them we can count on them\nAnd yet some of them continue to evolve and change\nThat enjoy your visit to Wisconsin and thanks for joining us today\nThank you Rob much enjoyed talking with you\nThat David Quammen author of more than Fifteen bucks including his latest it's called the tangled to treat a radical new history of life David will be speaking of the Wisconsin book festival on Thursday at six PM at the discovery building in Madison ...\nAnd uh the reason is is because I think you know just look at the demography and and I'm a demographer and a you know when I write I have taught charts and tables and I talk about all of that\nBut it's a very kind of slow going process uh you know this aging of the white population\nHas been occurring for quite a while a doodle lower fertility and not a lot of white immigration to the U.S and I think we can expect a lot of the white immigration to the U.S most of the the growing parts of the world or in Latin America and Asia and Africa and other and so forth as we look ahead to the extent we are going to have immigration that that's going to continue\nAnd that this younger part of the population if we're going to grow in the future and not be a country like Japan which is which is you know mega aging in terms of you know having an older population not getting a lot of immigration not having a high fertility rates were not going to be like that if we want to continue to grow we need to embrace\nA this youthful a minority population so I ended up there are people who are concerned about this and I can understand that\nI myself am am in my seventies so\nYou know lots of people my age are concerned that uh you know we're not the America we were in the Nineteen fifties or in the Nineteen sixties largely angle country not a lot of a sort of immigrant immigrants from from those countries that I talked about 'em but you know I think the demography is there to tell us\nThat uh if we invest in this younger generation they want to be mainstream they want to be real Americans they want to speak English they want to be part of the middle class\nA and if we understand that and we invest in these these folks were going to be in good shape compared to other western countries which have a hard time even a harder time than we do and they said except the immigrants\nTalking to William ... from the Brookings Institution author of diversity explosion how new racial demographics are remaking America One point you make it a is that you want to see us overcome what you call it cultural generation gap what is that what can we do about it\nA cultural generation gap is something I had written about for quite a while uh because I saw some of the attitudes of the older population sort of the older largely white population being a little bit suspicious about this change that's going on\nAnd the younger population they think that uh you know the country is kind of losing its core values or something because we have people coming in from other part of the parts of the world and it plays out or to election and then I and I say I've written about this for quite a while but it certainly came to the fore\nAnd the twenty sixteen presidential election because I think a lot of the kinds of\nAh messages that were coming out ah as a result of both parties or is that one party was sort of shaping their message to this kind of older white population wanting to make\nAgain let's move back to a demography of a different time and then the other candidate according bracing or maybe the other part of the uh the other part of the group of the other part of our population that younger more diverse part of the population and it showed up in the voting patterns to it to a sharp a degree\nIn twenty sixteen then in some of the earlier and they and some of the earlier presidential elections and we'll see how the shapes up in the midterms coming up in the next few years and so I mean it's kind of a you know it's not it has the cultural generation got so that's something I thought of as being a political thing necessarily\nBut just people's natural reactions to change people have difficulty with change sometimes and uh\nYou know the idea of of my writing and this book is to try to get them to understand that you know we need to adapt to this that's occurring slowly it's not going to hurt anybody really\nAh and ah so but that's there and those attitudes are there and and I think uh you know it would be good if people sort of looked at them in a way that we need to embrace each other these two generations and not the sort of fight with each other\nOn a weekend in a couple other smaller points that you raise in your book but significant changes one of them\nAre one of the big demographic stories of the twentieth century was that this huge migration of African Americans from the mostly rural south to the urban Midwest and north and now that's in many ways reverse thing is that right\nThat's correct I mean if you look at a sort of the broad history of the United states sometimes between Nineteen ten up until really the the mid late sixties uh there's been a you know a substantial black migration out of the south and then to the north of the the the turn of the previous century Nineteen hundred or so\nAbout Ninety percent of all the African\nAmericans in the U.S lived in the south\nAre of course that's consistent with American history a ... but you know over time um you know the agricultural ah ah ah the agricultural jobs and so forth and the south kind of drifted away or was industrial dust realization that a lot of northern cities people moved into northern cities at that point\nBut then when we got to about I'm Nineteen Seventy or so they started to be a trickle back to the south of a lot of African Americans as the south started to become economically more prosperous and a little bit more open to diversity than it had been for the earlier part of that decade but it's really now for the last twenty five years\nA big big movement of African Americans moving from those northern states that have been\nBeen big destinations for blacks\nMichigan uh Illinois New York I'm showing actually reverse migration moving back to the south and although blacks moved to all parts of the United\nStates are still much more likely to select southern destinations especially younger black college educated blacks or are people who at least with more than a high school education that's very important for them and even senior\nBlacks as they retire those folks who lived in northern cities as they're becoming a retirement age are more likely to move back to the south and into kind of new south states like Georgia and Texas and North Carolina and Florida there are some of the biggest gainers\nAh but you see a you know the city of Chicago in fact the whole metropolitan area of Chicago has seen an absolute decline in its black population recently as a result of this black migration back to the south\nIt's not going to William fries senior

build flashy buildings are stuck to New York city we call the outer boroughs of Brooklyn and queens where you work in Staten Island um and but he was always looking for a successor and his children\nAnd I'm Donald Trump was very clearly even though he was knocked the oldest son um the ones who emerged to fill that role\nAnd was very different and obviously very different from an early age he drew attention to himself and any ways that he could one of the most interesting things to us was to find articles from the seventies or Donald Trump is talking about his projects the things he's built the things he owns\nTo reporters and actually he's taking them on a tour of buildings that his father built and his father owns and Donald Trump at that time did not own at all um and he began to sort of appropriate his father's wealth for to build his public persona\nAnd all those father was very different he really seemed to admire that showmanship and Donald and that he could make things happen through that I'm being the the showman that he was\nGoing to one of our callers now eight hundred six four to one two three four Jason is with us in Milwaukee Jason Hi\nHi how are you good what did you want to bring up\nI'm just a was to make a comment that as a a a Trump supporter so when the vote for him that I'm a sort of had to send it back\nOf the art and by that I'm there would be nothing because he actually won that they were they nothing but the continued I'm a investigation\nIt turned out enough yet I'm and I'm a you know this is just a yet another thing that that kind of um has sour grapes written all over it from from the other side and ... it's really getting all um I just wanted to make that comment\nJason thanks for the call Jason not alone I similar things have been ... uh in the Republican world Ross why bother at this point uh the elections long gone why keep digging into the Trump family's finances\nHere we're not trying to change the election I mean this is a process that anyone enters public life goes through there is a way they represent themselves to the people and uh usually the campaign process a little bit longer and Donald Trump's case it was very short um and we're gonna continue to look at things that explain\nHis long life and business um and and now he's represented that before he ever came into a public life\nUsually by the time someone runs for president they've run for governor or senator or whatever else and they've been sort of that ad in that way and their life story has been looked at Donald Trump that's just not the case he was a television personality\nAnd a kind of a an interesting charisma addict\nFigure that people didn't uh take seriously on this level of so this is a usual sort of process that he's going to go through and the historians will continue to review on now for decades to come\nJason thanks for that call yeah the out all county building supply maintenance and we were talking about earlier as far as you could tell a that's the first reporting on that that was the first you had heard of it was new to a lot of people\nGet that's never been mentioned publicly before that's right and neither has the the trust or um the Trump Palace a investments thing that we mentioned in there all of this was totally new\nNow there's a lot we don't know you mentioned a couple of ah dribs and drabs of information about some more recent tax filings what what don't we have from President Trump that we might have had from most other presidential candidates in recent years\nWhile every presidential candidate for the last forty years or for the major parties has released they're all of their recent tax returns under the idea that\nPeople should be able to see what other sources of their income and that people should be able to determine for themselves\nWhether that represents any conflicts too with the actions that they might be taking a Donald Trump just chose not to do that first said that it was because he was under audits although he's never shown that there were actually audits taking place\nAnd he's rejected any notion that some of those audits from the nineties or the early to thousands must be complete by now and he could release those and he's just sort of maintain this a hard hard during pardon position on that\nGo to another caller now Jack is with us and Chippewa falls jak hello hello what did you want to bring up jak\nWell I guess what I'm thinking is the populist candidate that we put in and I guess we're all responsible or as really older wool over our eyes are multiple bankruptcy is factories Asian from from what we're hearing here today\nOr this this is a you know the guy that runs the populist apparently or as full a lot of people\nRight Jacqueline thanks for calling in let's talk a little bit about the bankruptcies Ross another angle in this story is when Donald Trump's business enterprises had to run into hard times sometimes they're helped or bailed out by again Fred Trump can you talk about how that happened\nSure I'm certainly the darkest years in Donald Trump's financial existence where a ride around Nineteen Ninety he had bought a bunch of high profile assets a prominent\nVery expensive casinos he had bought a ... from a Saudi prince and he did this with a extraordinary levels of debt that the enterprises couldn't support\nAnd my Nineteen Ninety it was all collapsing around him or some of his lenders were threatening to force them into bankruptcy and to foreclose and take all these properties and assets away\nI'm at that point in time the support from his father increased greatly his father also started paint himself much more um and we wonder if other amounts of that money went to Mr Trump that we haven't found yet but one example was I think I mentioned it early\nEarlier was investment that uh Fred Trump made and Trump Palace an apartment project that Donald Trump was building at the time\nIn Nineteen eighty seven Donald Trump voters father more than Fifteen million dollars and they converted that first Fifteen million dollars into an investment in the Trump Palace apartment building that I mentioned [noise]\nAnd then four years later I'm his father sold those shares back to his son for ten thousand dollars coincidentally a week after Donald Trump they'd received is ten thousand dollar Christmas Chuck from his father um so that\nBasically was a gift of Fifteen million dollars right at his son's darkest hour\nAnd then too complicated and to take a move that we've been told is is illegal or Fred Trump than wrote that\nThat off that Fifteen million dollars off as an investment loss on his income taxes um which saved him about five million dollars in income taxes um and we're told that those sort of they're called related party transactions are not legal\nAnd one weird story or a representative of fried Trump going into a New Jersey casino buying millions of dollars worth of chips and not wasting a bat\nThat's a great one to yes he was that was\nDonald Trump on that week was going to have to make a payment on his bonds has basically his loans I'm uh in order to keep his casinos and he didn't have the money for it\nHis father sent in a loyal aid or to buy three and a half million dollars in gambling chips and just put them back in the car and drive back to queens uh ultimately the authorities figured out that that was what had happened\nAnd that that was an illegal alone and Fred Trump years later was required to cash those chips back in\nBut it certainly uh got his son over the hump of on that given day\nSpring on one more caller Mike is with us in ... below Mike hello\nA year just had a question for your guest today\nYou know you talked about the investigation they did as far as the tax stuff did they go beyond just the Trump to that because it would be able to accomplish these activities\nThere had to be others involved as far as the person that the values you know and correctly on the buildings and you know the fact that even though these things down very blatant apparently at\nOfficials didn't bother to look at I mean with the wax\nGovernment this corruption wasn't allowed all this to happen Micah thanks Ross\nIt's a good question Mike thanks so in some cases there is no indication that the taxing authority is looked at these things we were talking about all county earlier the Trump Palace a investment last right off there is no hint that we see in the tax returns that we have the IRS was aware of anything untoward there or what the actual\nMechanics were of what was transpiring there in the case of the trust we are talking about and evaluations the IRS did look at it\nUm they did come back and say these valuations are too low and they required that Trump's to pay I Believe was about in that case five million dollars more in taxes um but that was nowhere near\nThat it appears that they missed were told by very prominent trust in his state attorneys weeks consulted on this um that that's very common that the IRS is typically very out gunned on these large complex returns that they don't hire their own appraisers generally to go out and look and see what the properties we're really worth\nThey just sort of say this seems low and if they can get five million dollars more they would call that a wind and our again are are are the trust in the state attorney and we talked to said that's a normal posture for them and most likely that Trump's happily signed that shack realizing that they had save\nUm U. W. Madison for example um has has actually seen an increasing graduation rate of ... across the board you demand has been a great job I really want to highlight that when it comes to graduating students across the board and have done a great job closing graduation disparity is not quite close yet uh between students of color but\nThey've all we've all seen them since they're bringing less students from Wisconsin come in um you know that that those rights are gonna be small so we're still seeing around Ninety to little over a hundred students that depending year to year black students graduating from U. W. Madison even though the graduation rate has gone up\nWant to highlight that first point you made there 'cause it seems like that's one of the big takeaways from this report the percentage of black high school graduates going to college here in Wisconsin yes ah was already low compared to ... to white students and it's gone down significantly yes\nSo that seems to be how big a starting point and that'll take us into some of your recommendations I were talking to Matthew brown getting round getting from the group cows looking at racial and ethnic disparities in higher education here in Wisconsin so\nLet's start with that or the ... worsening gap in terms of the number of high school students of color black students particular going into our colleges here\nWas an report what kinds of things could help turn that around yeah I'm so with with\nYou know one of the biggest things and then and actually I I was reporting report that I that I came to my mind after we published it was um getting rid of a access tests\nUm so you think of like a C te SAT which is not to you know when you look at what's we aren't indicative of a really a performance it's more so indicative of how well you take those specific tests and all sorts of things so that's something that that isn't in it that is is a big thing but when it comes to\nUh it can continue in throughout that pre college programs have have shown to work or a quite a bit across the country\nUm and it's it's definitely one of the things that we we recommend can team investment in that\nI ... I Do want to say all of our recommendations are really contingent on the state of Wisconsin ... investing in these public institutions they have to have the resources to be able to spend on recruiting and bringing in in preparing students for their universities\nYeah it's a point to you and your coauthor is made in the report these problems are at a W and to a lesser extent the technical college system there are problems that we're necessarily caused by\nThose school right right and and even then you know some of this is definitely things that is even within their hands granted you know as as we've seen a decline within our K. to twelve twelve system that's going to impact us students coming in to these schools but at the same time when they get here\nThat's on the schools um again they still have to have the resources to help the students to to hire more ... advisors and culture comes in and visors to help create a a cultural centers and to help students feel welcome on a camp off campus one of the biggest things we've seen a wide students end up\nTransferring out particularly VW Madison or leaving or even post graduation as as we see with a brain drain of students of color on campus\nIs that feeling of being welcome or not um and the creation of of dedicated spaces for students of color and cultural competence spaces and advisors and professors or that look like them that that have diverse backgrounds\nHelp create a a welcoming atmosphere um as well as at times even more of a enhanced or\nA syllabus for for classes and\nSo one point you make the report I'm paraphrasing loosely here uh you make the case that if the goal is to increase attendance rates and graduation rates for students of color are there have to be not colorblind top policies they have to reach out directly to in this case I African Americans\nAbsolutely or you can't undo years of targeted and purposeful um racialized and an ethnic oppression with colorblind policies the only way to undo these types of policies and and\nThe the legacy impact an ongoing impact and ongoing practices is through targeted a policy is an actions that on do that purposefully undo a racialized than an ethnic oppression\nAnother recommendation in the report is more on the economics of college a lot often you know of color are from lower income backgrounds can you talk about what you'd be looking for there\nYeah so it again I I Do want to give a andme ATC and and then you'd have you imagine a shot out with um you know they have the batter promising ATC has tuition promises for students\nUm this is huge uh when it comes to those tuition costs\nIn helping students come to these institutions really goes a long way and increasing access as well as graduation um college costs ... you can back in the day you know my dad could could you know go work for summer and pays tuition\nOr can't do that anymore um so that's absolutely help students that that um I'm going to be disproportionately students of color as well as coming from from low income background\nStop it tuition on one of the biggest obstacles that we've seen um is is housing security and and food security thirty six percent of students nationally or housing insecure another thirty six percent are food insecure\nWe know these things have a direct causation and correlation with um with how you perform at school and if you actually can maintain attendance throughout the impact as massive when students don't have these things\nSo the economic support for things beyond tuition like that as well as even childcare as we've seen a rise in more a single parents are going back to school or even going to school for for the first time a these kind of a holistic approach to supporting um students is is that\nWe're talking to Matthew

happen with that what are they worried about if we see to that level\nBullets to point seven degrees Fahrenheit and ... so that you know so it's it's one one ... that makes it sound maybe a little smaller than it is because itself has and we're already at one Celsius so one point eight Fahrenheit and that's the rise since\nThe since the late Nineteen century so one of the most striking there's many many impacts that scientists are now able to discern one is that you would be moving into a world where one of the fundamental ecosystems of the planet coral reefs\nUh they've been like into the rain forest to see it they might basically be almost gone at one point five degrees Celsius so that's pretty striking an entire ecosystem that is just to you know kind of defines the tropics the tropical delta the whole planet um that's one of the most striking in fact there are many many others\nAnd ah the risk of the displacement of millions of people I mean we hear political stories about immigrants and refugees are causing the issue of refugees are causing political turmoil and a lot of countries around the world climate change could make a lot more of that happened and it sounds like they're saying\nA group of creatures that had been taken for bacteria small single celled simple internal structure uh creatures microbes um but\nConsidered under his methods of sequencing genomes very early genome sequencing roof revealed themselves to be not bacteria at all and in fact\nMore different from bacteria than they are from us than they are from the the uh the limb of the tree of life that includes all complex creatures animals plants fun guy et cetera these things are now known as archaea because there are thought to be perhaps\nRelated to the oldest forms of life on earth but there was discovered by Carl was a third\nKingdom of life and that was sort of the opening shot in this revolution I describe in the book\nAnd part of that revolution is this new way this new technology that the St Charles Darwin wouldn't have had handy forum where we can read and we can do it in a more effectively and cheaply we can read DNA I dig down to the molecules talk about how that's a sad thing out of the way we do have allusion\nThat's right it's this whole new field of science with the fancy name molecular file a genetics and essentially what that means is sequencing genome sequencing the DNA and in some cases are in a within living organisms and then comparing those sequences between different organisms to see\nWho is how closely related to who else and how far back in time the or the divergence of different lineages go but in doing that scientist also started to discover that there were genes moving sideways not just vertically through the lens of the tree of life\nTalking to David Quammen about his new book tangled tree a radical new history of life you speaking of the Wisconsin book festival this Thursday at six at the discovery building in Madison\nLet's dig into that idea you're just dropped on his David my understanding of genetics is I get my genes from my parents and then they get them from their parents and so on and that's how I got most of my genes right bart riders\nAre they call them inside football the lateral and happening in the genetic world\nYes there is this phenomenon that scientists call horizontal gene transfer genes moving sideways\nAcross species boundaries even across boundaries between kingdoms of life or this is supposed to be impossible I'd written three or four earlier books on evolution and I thought I knew\nA couple of good reasons why it was impossible but it turns out it is possible it's not easy it's not frequent except among bacteria and archaea it happens very rapidly among them genes moving sideways\nBut it happens also in higher creatures so that we humans contain some stretches of DNA that have come to us sideways from bacteria and sizable stretches of DNA that have come to us sideways from viruses in the course of viral infections that have gotten into\nInto the germ line into the reproductive cells into the ovaries and test the use of humans and been passed down eight percent of our genomes we now know consist of viral DNA acquired sideways\nI Want to nail down here somebody along the way you can have a virus pop new genes into them and they pass them down to their kid does not just in a skin cell or something it actually has passed down to future generations\nThat's right retroviruses which which insert their DNA into the genomes of the cells they in fact I'm In a in the case of HIV they infect immune cells and we call that aids but if they infect reproductive cells and not just the immune cells in the blood if they infect eggs in sperm\nThan they can patch their DNA into the DNA that is passed along to offspring and that has happened um enough time so that our our genomes as I say now consists of about eight percent viral ... DNA acquired sideways\nThe weight Darwin presented it one way it sounds to me like it could account for more variation right 'cause all we thought of earlier was okay genes mutate and then get past the natural selection works on them this is another mechanism Frisbee seems to have new genes to be subject to natural selection right\nThat's exactly right and that's important these new discoveries don't overturn Darwin but they add to Darwinian theory of evolution\nBy a a revealing that ... that a mutation is not the only source of innovation in genomes it doesn't just happen by incremental changes when DNA copies itself inaccurately by one letter or a few\nLetters innovation can also come into a genome in huge lumps in quanta in whole genes and stretches of packets of genes coming in sideways by horizontal gene transfer\nAnd providing new innovation new material on which Darwinian natural selection acts\nYou mentioned that bacteria are more prone to do this horizontal stop this horizontal gene transfer for bacteria that causes diseases is this something that makes them or something we worry about more\nThis is vastly important when it comes to the matter of disease causing bacteria because we now realize that this whole problem that everybody has heard about an antibiotic resistant bacteria things like MRSA\nThe killer bugs that you can't you can't kill with um with the antibiotics that we have\nWe now realize that uh\nWas single strain of bacteria ... choir its resistance to a certain antibiotic gradually by incremental mutation but once acquired it can pass the gene for that resistance sideways two completely different kind of bacterium from ... to ... to salmonella\nPackets of resistance\nConferring genes moving sideways instantly from one kind of bacteria into another and that's why antibiotic resistance has spread around the world so so quickly and has now killing tens of thousands of people every year\nAll right that's disturbing I Want to bring things back to the family tree now\nI it sounds like usually if we did genetic testing of humans we'd figure out if we touched them most of our genes we'd find oh our cousins the chimpanzees and orangutans are pretty close to them further from other primates and so on down the line\nBut if we picked up a particular gene I might say it might look like are closely related to I don't know must grab her a pumpkin or something if those particular genes got transferred over\nOr a bacterium yes yes it probably not pump Perry Perry counterintuitive a it's a it's less likely that as a pumpkin and are you here for a bacterium to get some DNA into our genome than it is for a pumpkin\nAll right but does this can muddy the waters as we're trying to map that family tree out if there are this strange stuff in there\nIt absolutely does and that's why my book is titled the tangled tree with this reveals is that the shape of the history of life is not just shaped like a tree with limbs and branches diverging diverging diverging but that in some cases limbs and branches converge\nMoving sideways one imagine one branch moving sideways flowing into another branch and carrying it sapped into that other branch we now realize that that's what the the quote unquote tree of life looks like\nNow this mental molecular biology and addicts you're talking about it's a made a lot of discoveries already bought in the world the science is is pretty new stuff what are you watching for on the frontiers of this now\n[noise] well we're learning more and more about the now that we have the human genome sequenced more and more about where\nThree point two billion letters of DNA and our genomes where it came from we're learning more about human identity of course we're learning more about issues of human health but we're also learning about our own deepest history we're learning that we humans are\nWe think of ourselves as individuals but in fact we are mosaics we contain some ancestry from bacteria some ancestry from viruses some ancestry of course from other primates\nAnd so it binds us even more closely to the rest of the natural world it's humbling but I think it's also majestic an exhilarating to\nTo get this dawning new understanding of our human identity\nIn a broader perspective of how we think of science so you mentioned earlier that you've written books that assumed this stuff couldn't happen does this say kind of reinforce the idea that science is is a process it's not a set of facts to memorize from a textbook but it's this living thing that we're doing all the time\nAbsolutely sciences discovery science is hypothesized hope POTUS is testing science is empirically supported theories\nBut it's also competition and ambition and insecurity and uh [noise] um are there moments its its drinking beer and the court orders of hotels during conferences that's a very human process and and and looking at it as I tried to in this book reminds us that even the biggest\nOf ideas or work in progress\nThat's part of the ethic and the ethos of science that we make these discoveries we support them we can count on them and yet some of them continue to evolve and change\nDavid enjoy your visit to Wisconsin and thanks for joining us today\nThank you Rob much enjoyed talking with you\nThat David Quammen author of more than Fifteen bucks including his latest it's called the tangled to treat a radical new history of life David will be speaking of the Wisconsin book festival on Thursday at six PM at the discovery building in Madison\nA doodle lower fertility and not a lot of white immigration to the U.S I don't think we can expect a lot of the white immigration to the U.S most of the the growing parts of the world or in Latin America and Asia and Africa and other and so forth as we look ahead to the extent we are going to have immigration that that's going to continue\nAnd that this younger part of the population if we're going to grow in the future and not be a country like Japan which is which is you know mega aging in terms of you know having an older population not getting a lot of immigration not having a high fertility rates\nWere not going to be like that if we want to continue to grow we need to embrace a this useful a minority population so I you know there are people who are concerned about this and I can understand that\nI myself am them in my seventies so I Know lots of people my age are concerned that uh\nYou know we're not the America we were in the Nineteen fifties or in the Nineteen sixties largely angle country not a lot of a sort of immigrant immigrants from from those countries that I talked about\n'em but you know I think the demography is there to tell us that uh if we invest in this younger generation they want to be\nMainstream they want to be real Americans they want to speak English they want to be part of the middle class a and if we understand that and we invest in these these folks were going to be in good shape compared to other\nWestern countries which have a hard time even a harder time than we do and they said except immigrants\nTalking to William ... from the Brookings Institution author of diversity explosion how new racial demographics are remaking America One point you make it a is that you want to see us overcome what you call it cultural generation gap what is that what can we do about it\nA cultural generation gap is something I had written about for quite a while\nUh because I saw some of the attitudes of the older population sort of the older largely white population being a little bit suspicious about this change that's going on and the younger population they think that uh you know the country has kind of losing its core values or something because we have people coming in from other part of the parts of the world and it\nPlays out or to election then I and I say I've written about this for quite a while but it's certainly came to the fore\nAnd the twenty six team presidential election because I think a lot of the kinds of\nAh messages that were coming out ah as a result of both parties or is that new one party was sort of\nShaping their message to this kind of older white population wanting to make America great again meaning again let's move back to a demography of a different time and then the other candidate according bracing\nOr maybe the other part of the uh the other part of the group of the other part of our population that younger more diverse part of the population and it showed up in the voting patterns to it to a sharp a degree\nIn twenty sixteen\nThen in some of the earlier and they and some of the earlier presidential elections and we'll see how the shapes up in the midterms coming up in the next few years and so I mean it's kind of a you know it's not\nIt has the cultural generation got something I thought of as being a political thing necessarily but just people's natural reactions to change people have difficulty with change sometimes and you know the idea of of my writing in this book is to try to get them to understand that you know we need to adapt to this that's occurring slowly it's not\nUh and uh so but that's there and those attitudes are there and and I think uh you know it would be good if people sort of looked at them in a way that we need to embrace each other these two generations and not the sort of fight with each other\nOn a weekend in a couple of other smaller points that you raise in your book but significant changes one of them are one of the big demographic stories of the twentieth century was that this huge migration of African Americans from the mostly rural south to the urban Midwest and north and now that's in many ways reverse thing is that right\nThat's correct I mean if you look at the sort of the broad history of the United states sometimes between Nineteen ten up until really the the mid late sixties\nUh there's been a you know a substantial black migration out of the south and into the north of the the the turn of the previous century Nineteen hundred or so about Ninety percent of all the African Americans in the U.S lived in the south\nAre of course that's consistent with American history a ... but you know over time um you know the agricultural uh the\nUh the agricultural jobs and so forth and the south kind of drifted away or was industrial dust realization that a lot of northern cities people moved into northern cities at that point but then when we got to about I'm Nineteen Seventy or so\nThey started to be a trickle back to the south of a lot of African Americans as the south started to become economically more prosperous and a little bit more open to diversity there had been for the earlier part
