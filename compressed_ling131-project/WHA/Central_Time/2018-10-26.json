round of payments to farmers suffering from the effects of increased tariffs in December as hope Kerwin reports dairy farmers in Wisconsin and across the United states so their industry deserves a bigger piece of that funding\nThe national milk producers federation says the USDA's terrorists mitigation program hasn't done enough to help dairy farmers offset the impact of retaliatory tariffs from China and Mexico and other countries\nThe group estimates the agency has given one hundred and twenty seven million dollars to dairy farmers that the industry is expected to lose more than one billion dollars in sales this year Gary analyst mark Stevens in from the University of Wisconsin Madison says many us She's pretty serious absorb the cost Mexico's terrorists\nBut as this continues to

up in our series of Kennedy interviews we'll talk with Margaret Engebretson she's a Democrat running for the seat in Wisconsin seven congressional district and\nFirst us Commerce Department released its latest report on the country's gross domestic product today and it's got good news about the economy economic growth expectations again with the economy growing three and a half percent and the third quarter but the stock market\nDoesn't seem to be overjoyed by the news and some other indicators are mixed when it comes to the nation's economic future a county attorney covers the stock market for the wall Street Journal economy welcome back to central time\nThanks for having me\nWe've got this three percent growth in the GDP of first of all give us a little one on one what does the GDP actually measure\n[laughter] so gross domestic product for really measuring all economic uh\n... things like consumer spending I'm spending among businesses and also of course spending by the government and we see that a lot of these areas did contribute to the numbers that we saw for the third quarter um which is a fast pace of growth since twenty fourteen I'm\nIn particular consumers were another area of strength again um and we also saw business investment I'm Sorry government spending contribute to the growth rate that we saw in twenty uh twenty eight team\nAnd this is not too good back to back corridors again as I understand that the best back to back to the quarter twenty fourteen uh how good a news do economists viewed as being for the U.S economy\nTwo sided on the one hand I think a lot of people are\nI'm excited about the figures that we saw today because they do confirmed that we're still seeing momentum in the economy um which of course has been expanding for almost ten years at this point the second longest expansion in us history um but on the other hand I think a lot of folks these days especially when it comes to markets and\nOn the economy are looking forward and trying to get a sense of how much longer this kind of momentum can keep up for and I think there we had a little bit more emerging as they think a connoisseur widely expecting this growth to slow down\nA in twenty Nineteen indefinitely and twenty twenty as well so I think there's a little bit of optimism but folks are still a little nervous about what the future holds\nAre there are things that people are looking and saying okay this is a relief or maybe you even indicator that so yeah maybe there's a slowdown around the corner\nDefinitely and I think the first one that comes to mind is housing where we've seen a existing home sales slumped for four consecutive months at a point\nUm which is sort of amazing when you think about how strong the broader economy looks like and how high measures of consumer confidence had been tracking\nAnd it seems like this should be in an area where we're still seeing strength but economists keep saying that rising mortgage rates have really started to take a toll on a homeowners' ability to\nAnother big issue lately is a trade and tariffs concerns about the impact of tariffs on Wisconsin producers manufacturers farmers of the state's economy what direction do you think Congress and the nation should take on trade\nPolicy [noise] well I think it's really concerning that the Trump Administration has put in tariffs huge tariffs on certain countries and he has used uh terrorists as a\nA sledgehammer instead of a scalpel now in some cases there's gonna be a need for tariffs but the way they're being implemented now is causing a lot of\nUnintended consequences within our economy and as far as trade goes for many of our\nTrade agreements we have had business interests well represented at the table but we also need to bring in and take into account labor interests and environmental interests and be more thoughtful about the long term\nImpacts that these agreements have\nWould you like to see some of our agreements like it'd be agreements on we noticed NAFTA a renegotiated with those interest in mind labor in the environment\nI definitely think we should take a look at NAFTA and who's being helped here and make sure that everyone has a voice in this but this agreement has been in place for a very very long time so a lot of the\nDamage shall we say to labor has already occurred now it's unfortunate that we didn't do better planning ahead of time as we\nA transition into a more global economy\nBut there are definitely things that we can do an important thing here is is that we need you know all the stakeholders involved in making a plan because we're all affected and when we all do better uh we all do better\nNow immigration has been a priority for the Trump Administration and it's a long running issue in Congress we're not too much has actually been resolved what would you look for when it comes to immigration policy from the United states\nYeah this is a disappointment I Know for a lot of Americans and our Congress has gotten close several times to coming to a bipartisan solution to reform our immigration system\nBut we haven't been successful and now in the current climate with the vice of politics and\nUh you know a lot of our elected leaders and people running for office are using it as a wedge to uh run their campaigns on and it's it's really\nUm unethical and just honorable and many of these cases what is being said now that the current immigration system does need reform and we've seen how it really really matters\nWho is implementing policy\nNeed to do is address the I think it's eleven twelve million undocumented immigrants in this nation who are contributing to our communities are working they're paying taxes\nAnd we must provide a pathway to citizenship for those that are law abiding and have followed the rules\nThe um visa system has to be reformed it's creating problems especially here in Wisconsin for agriculture and\nWe have to look at our system as a whole and as a nation we need to start discussing immigration policy like who are we I mean what is\nWho do we want hear how many people are weak and I welcome into our nation or to become Americans\nSo that is that is going to be a long conversation where we you know all voices need to be heard on this but continuing to use it as a wedge issue and away too frightened people is just unconscionable\nDo you see yourself being able if elected to work across the aisle with Republicans either in the house or or with those in the Senate to try to come up with something that ah all sides can agree on\nI certainly hope so look I I'm going to Congress to try to help make it work better because I Am not going to get there and dig in my hills and not\nUm refuse to work with people because they belong to a different party now that doesn't mean that I Will um you know\nFor ... sake my values and my code of honor and what I think is ethical and write most certainly not a that would betray my ... to my constituents into this nation but I Would really love to work with\nAnyone that is truly focused on\nA progressing and getting past this point\nTalking I'm Margaret Engebretson Democrat running for Wisconsin's seventh congressional district seat representing much of northern in central Wisconsin\nMargaret's and uh let's turn now to the national debt we saw a big jump over the last year a ride and Seventeen percent from the previous year despite a growing economy how do you think Congress should tackle the annual deficit the growing national debt [noise]\nWell this is a situation where are the Republicans in Congress push through this reckless tax bill without debate without much analysis and behind closed doors and not working with\nA members of the Democratic party who are they're representing millions of Americans and they pushed it through and many outside special interests had a hand in drafting this tax bill\nAnd unsurprisingly it is geared to give this huge tax windfall to the ultra wealthy and corporations leaving in place loopholes like the carried interest loophole and this was exactly the wrong thing to do with the wrong time\nNow what we need to do is in the state of the economy as it is if we're going to deficits band we need to be doing it in ways that\nA provides growth for the entire economy so investing in infrastructure\nWe ... we have many areas of this country that is desperate for infrastructure spending much like I'm the seventh congressional district here in Wisconsin education I'm investing in a new technologies and\nUm energy economy\nYeah we had a caller wondering if you'd consider making incentives for individuals using solar power or other alternative energy sources that would be part of your goal\n[noise] yes that would be one piece of a holistic plan\nWhat we need to do is reduced carbon and you can uh address climate change\nAnd um reducing fossil fuel consumption by taxing the use of carbon regulating the use of carbon and of course subsidizing um research into a solar wind\nAnd new technologies to make this transition we've got to make this transition the stakes are very very high and we are already paying massive cost for not addressing this issue in the form of\nIncreased extreme weather events and it's even causing migration patterns around the world where people can no longer um use their land for farming and this is a global issue we must address\nAnd can you tackle you issue for us of of civility in politics for my last year shooting of Republican congressmen at a baseball practice to this a pipe bomb incident over the last week plus a lot of heated political rhetoric what are your thoughts on that\n[noise] well when I lost my campaign here back in February twelfth of this year in superior where I'm at right now\nSpoke about this at length in my um my launch speech it is a main reason why I'm running for Congress is because\nOver the years I've seen our politics degrade\nOur politics be corrupted by special interests and big money and the um increasing uh ability and willingness to use a inflammatory rhetoric and what's happened here over the years\nEspecially since around Nineteen Ninety four in the the republic Republican Newt Gingrich revolution it is a zero sum\nDefeat your enemy and looking at the other political party is not a one that just disagrees with you\nBut that must be completely um destroyed and that is has caused all kinds of issues\nIt has caused our Congress to come to a grinding halt we have had our our our Congress shut down um our government and and sit there without funding to all these things we need and the American people I don't\nSo every time a recipe can be made ahead I let you know I mean one of my favorite recipes is the um the chart tomatoes stuffed peppers and\nI Love them because they're beautiful I Love them because they're delicious nothing because you can make the peppers ahead keep them in the fridge loose than when you have time and\nYou can serve the dish either hot warm or at room temperature and I think when you can make something will happen and when you can show that at room temperature rented coalition that wouldn't temperature as it is when it comes to check out of the other\nI think that's a real boon for all of us who are busy\nTalking to Dorie Greenspan her new cookbook is every day during the way I cook she's with us for this edition of food friday you shared a few recipes with a story we have in my mind by the way a WPRI dot org slash rude friday\nThis is a nice comforting sounding food for the fall of maple syrup and mustard Brussels sprouts ... somebody said Rob put together three flavors views are not the three things I probably would come up with but this you say works\nSo well I don't know [laughter] no [laughter] yes it work\nLike around ... if you ask me but but I I Want to hear more about it\n[laughter] well actually recipe ... that's a good way of [laughter]\nI'm Still brussel sprouts or you know as we get into the colder weather will vary depending on the vegetables and vegetables like\nBrussel sprouts and looking for ways to make them more interesting so much to really add ... ... ... really first so much to kind of release them up a little bit and gives them some ... ... ...\n... um go with with um ... and the meat books are just lounge everything out\nMaybe it's just too little sweet against the garlic and the um Charlotte said er vinegar optional put ... great last minute addition to show me get dishes like lemon juice something to just\nTake it a little ... to ... that really comforting\nIt's funny you say that because we just in the last year or so I think probably inspired by somebody on food friday when I have that food is super whatever that I think others need that little extra something right at the end some kind of vinegar or or lemon pie is what really puts it over the top to you is that something you do a lot at the at the tail end\nObsolete so a little bit of lemon juice can lemon death I mean I never want to be without a lemon and never want to be without solved never want to be the mustard those are the weak thinks it will\nAnd when you put them in with the own when they're not cooked into the ditch that's when you get their full labor and that's when it all just that extra that it's going to shop and make people take notice\nAgain we have that maple syrup and mustard Brussels sprouts over WPRI dot org slash food friday if you're intrigued I went over I I think I'll give that a

Robert\nMonth there was a state wide living and storytelling editor for the USA Today network Wisconsin He is based in Warsaw Rob welcome back Hi thanks for having me well we've got this election coming up not too far off now early voting is going on people are watching for early voting numbers what kind of information do we have out there so far\nSo let me preface this by saying that these are these are these numbers are public information they're interesting\nIt's a perfectly fine topic to to talk about on the radio\nUm but the next thing I Want to say is that\nWe can talk about the number is no one has any idea what's up for what they mean for the actual actions we can get into that I'm about to answer the question um the urban Milwaukee calling this Bruce Murphy on Thursday was reporting on this and\nTotals from Madison in Milwaukee are high more than sixteen thousand people in Madison had voted\nMore than ten thousand in Milwaukee I'm basically it looks like early voting is going to increase above two thousand fourteen totals um which is the right comparison because that's the last midterm\nAnd those are big democratic strongholds or so a lot of people might look at those numbers and neither hope or fear but that means there's hired democratic turnout that doesn't mean that's what's going on necessarily though\nRight I mean uh yeah yeah exactly that ... Democrats once you look at these numbers and see signs of voter enthusiasm\nAnd of course there are lots of signs of of democratic voter enthusiasm not least of which is that in public polls when you ask people argue enthusiastic about voting Democrats in Wisconsin score higher on that then then Republicans this year at this time\nUm so the idea behind sort of looking at this as as uh\nSome part of ... of that this would show that democratic base so fired up to to vote that they can't even wait until November sex and that could be true that certainly in individual cases that it is true but the other thing about these two places these two Democratic strong laws Milwaukee in Madison is that\nThey are also the largest cities in the state and therefore the places most likely to have the longest lines on election day so for some people it might not be so much about like their own enthusiasm as it is that man last time\nIn the non group market are buying insurance on their own [noise]\nAnd\nWho do who ends up paying for this how much does it split between what the employers pay and what the employees pay\nNo it's a great question there's tremendous amount of variation some employers have entire premium other employers are asking employees to pay a tremendous amount of it made me up\nBut on average the employer and the employee or splitting the can you imagine a similar percentage or so or on average for single coverage employ a phase or Eighteen percent of the premium and twenty Seventeen which is roughly similar to what it was years ago\nAnd even ... it can present matters because the premiums that are worth a lot of money now to the average premium for single coverage now is closing seven thousand dollars for a premium for a family of four is almost twenty thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars a lot of money no matter how you got to\nHave you been tracking this as I said for a couple of decades now and so you have a before and after the Affordable CARE Act did try I mean they've been going up the whole time did anything change as far as the trends are when the Affordable CARE Act got past\n[noise] yes the final ... kind of was filling in a lot of the gaps around the employer system\nSo in some ways incredible ...\nImpacts the employers are doing you know large employers now have to offer health benefits but almost all of them already where there are some minor differences like employees now have shorter waiting carrying it or they they are required to have a waiting period lasts Ninety Days before they kinda Roland coverage and\nAt USC and editors pocket on health spending a year that's intact but you know I guess I kind of peripheral issues to system in terms of cost and employer operates and she was eligible uncover which we haven't seen a lot of changes to the last ten years there have been remarkably consistent\nAlthough you know there are long longer term trends that have\nExisted before and after the CIA employees still have to figure out ways to pay for what is an incredibly expensive medicine [noise]\nMatthew ray is with us from the Kaiser Family foundation talking about a new report on the cost of healthcare we're focusing on employer sponsored plan they don't get always as much attention but a lot of Americans get their health insurance through their employer\nOr the report finds a long term costs are going up there being a ... held by the employers and the employees\nAnd Matthew do we know what is driving ah the increase in these costs over the years [noise] yeah so they tend to get good news\nBad news story right the good news is that we're seeing a relatively low premier increase so this year family premiums increase to five percent\nSome twenty Seventeen which you know is much less than ... can you increase as we see for people buying up other out or the increase as we saw in nearly two thousand and some ways that's a good story the bad news is that five percent still adds up over time to do a lot of money in terms of why we're seeing\nCost growth that we are is it's a balance when employers get a premium increase they have to make decisions of their plans so they may change their plans to try to reduce cost riffing things like increasing deductibles\nWhich has the effect does decreasing their premium and uh that the employer has to pay for the coverage but ultimately like premiums are driven by one or two things right how many services are covered and how much does it cost so\nIncrease in premiums are because the actual ... really expensive and lots of parts of the United states\nAnd that's been a criticism of the Affordable CARE Act that it's covered a who covers health care who pays for the insurance but not didn't always tackle\nThe those underlying cost increases do we know what is making a annual cost of healthcare go up and I think go up faster than the rate of inflation [noise] yeah\nAbsolutely faster than the rate of inflation Everytime I'm well a lot of its market by market right so hospitals and providers will negotiate with insurers and set prices\nThat's the price of employer wind up paying so when those prices go up over time then employers and employees end up paying more to premiums\nAnd do we know I I mean those bigger employers in particular they as these costs go up they don't necessarily have the option of of just dropping healthcare altogether is that right well they can\nUm ended Affordable Care act that have to pay a penalty for that but\nMost employers don't off for most starts employers offered health benefits before before double cataract some Ninety percent of workers are at an out of from the office health benefits firms offer health benefits because they want to recruit and retain the best employees and that's still something employees\nThink of when they're shopping for a new job especially now when labor market the tighter we there's no reason to expect that employers are especially large employers are leaving the space um we continue expecting corps offer coverage\nNow there is a there have been attempts to repeal the Affordable CARE Act in Congress so that fell short there's a lawsuit challenging the constitutionally ... constitutionality I should say it'd be Affordable Care act\nHas given what you said earlier would at the end of the Affordable CARE Act it affected the employer provided health care market all that much\nUm yeah like it's a health care system writes a changing things anywhere will impact things everywhere else but ultimately like him or his continue to offer coverage because our employees expect 'em so\nCame just thinking of changes in health care system like policy will continue in fact what employers are doing but not not at the core of it\nAnd I've been a asking you kind of about national numbers in national trends or is it does it breakdown differently depending on where you are in the country when it comes to the rising costs of employer provided health care\nOh absolutely yeah absolutely cost vary tremendously across the U.S it and are they ... even within markets\nTo tremendous variation and what what what where workers are paying in terms of deductibles or in terms of what they're contributing towards the premium [noise]\nNow looking at the last Twenty years overall is has there been and you were touching on this earlier how much has the annual rate of increase change are we seeing eye and I'm putting this in a weird way are we seeing decreases in the annual\nIncreases [laughter] I Know exactly what you mean [laughter] um yes the rate of growth and slower over the last five years but it was over that it was Fifteen Years ago so premiums are going slower than they were that they were early early on the two thousands\nThey're still going faster than what workers' wages and inflation are\n[noise] and he is that ultimately means that premiums are continuing eating it if you think that employers substitute health benefits for wages that that done the interpretation would be that premiums continued it in order for us\nThis interesting so I I don't know if you dug into this and particularly in your part are you seeing a these are the cost of healthcare eating into a salary so a great good news my costs of health insurance didn't come up but I'm if I'm unemployed but I didn't get that raise I might have gotten otherwise\nYes employers will make that on an individual decision obviously but I'm the health insurance costs a lot of money for employers who I think they take that consideration on their uh comes in and workers [noise]\nAnd what kind of trends are you watching for it now as as we look ahead again some uncertainty in the healthcare marketplace what kind of things are you watching for now as we go from twenty Eighteen to twenty Nineteen\n[noise] so a couple of things I still think that what employees have to pay to cost sharing remains really important\nSo most workers will face that you'd have to a bowl or co pay or car insurance before they can use most health care services especially deductibles we've\nSeen those go up rapidly overtime macho pacing inflation so that puts the solitaire cost and people who use services\nSo that trend continues that meaningful impacts for people who get sick just like us workers [noise] um I think employers continue to think about how to deliver care in terms of networks ... are in their networks and how they can deliver care more efficient\nOr more cost effective ways of thinking of her that going forward will be interesting\nAnd of course continue to get interesting things that they're a wellness programs for many employers now have meaningful financial incentives to encourage you to do health examinations or participate in very small this programs\nLeave it there for now Matthew thanks a lot for joining us today great thank you now is Matthew ray of the Kaiser Family foundation he was with us to talk about the groups new research on employer sponsored health plans which shows rising costs for premiums and deductibles costs are going up for employers and employees\nComing up national politicians and celebrities are rallying support for candidates here in Wisconsin and around the country will talk about the impact these endorsements have on voters is\nMean WPRI tonight at seven thirty for an election special about the\nBig ticket item the race for Wisconsin's governor hosted by WPRI Shawn Johnson in Wisconsin Public television's Frederica ... feels it features profiles a Republican Governor Scott Walker and democratic challenger Tony Uber's\nWhat's their views on key issues like education taxes health care the economy and transportation\nAnd Republicans support for the Republican\nWhat more interesting ones actually was with Lee of the Khmer I'm as someone who doesn't live in Wisconsin and has never lived in Wisconsin if I were just going off of you know looking at who had endorsed the mayor and who had endorsed her opponent Nicolas Nicolas ... yeah\nYeah I Would have immediately thought of this race is going to go to Nicholas him because he had the support of an end of Steve Bannon who at the time was so popular more so popular and then um as well as great America pac\nClub for growth money and on the ... we're looking at ... had the n._r._a. and so if I was just looking at those as signals I would've thought you know Nicholson would win but of course the one\nIn ... in a really competitive I'm Rae but overall some of the more surprising things we saw was that I'm a\nInterest groups that traditionally has influence like NRA on in this election cycle ... weren't necessarily as if we look at their when record and it wasn't necessarily as high as you might expect they think\nOr so I'm uh fifty seven percent\nWhen record keeping that had a lot to do with the fact\nThat they didn't endorse that many candidates an indoor slug candidates and the same race but that one stood out to me is very interesting um Trump and did a lot of endorsing during the primary that's really rare for president to try and steer a race during a primary instead of waiting until the general uh and\nAll the candidates he endorsed one with the exception of two\nDozen other interesting thing we observed I'm but certainly during a primary endorsements carry a lot more weight which is why we were so interested in them and also they signal you know what direction the party is going that was kind of the genesis of the project we were interested in saying which wing of the Democratic party\nIs going to emerge and twenty Eighteen which wing of the Republican Party is going to emerge and we felt like endorsements were a good proxy for those sort of ideological variation\nI Know there's a lot of arguments about that I think among Democrats and Republicans are when you broke a do did you see lessons we can learn in an either or both parties about ah which trend or within the party was was was more powerful in this primary season\nSo\nFor the Democrats she found the party still decide that uh there's a political science book called the party decides a that was written in two thousand eight ... says the party endorsement kind of picks picks the winter and the party the people that the party is the official party indoors did do really well they one Ninety\nFive percent of the races but the question is are the party is the party endorsing candidates they're already going to win a\nSo we couldn't necessarily tease that out what I thought was more interesting was this search on the Democratic side of progressive groups like indivisible is new justice Democrats his new our revolution is new these are all new ... a\nVery liberal progressive groups and never getting involved in while their candidates you know they didn't necessarily have a wind right over fifty or sixty percent\nTheir candidates are still winning so I think that says that the Democratic party while the party official party endorsement still one there is a a storm brewing on the left um that is going to change the Democratic party going forward\nCelebrities often adores her campaign with or raise funds for candidates I don't know how much do affect those are once through the got a lot of attention this year as a swift not often directly involving herself in politics\nBeat a very specific ... with the University of Tennessee awesome people looked at sort of look voter registration jumped off then what do you make of of that particular celebrity endorsement in between the election so\nYou know your initial question about do endorsements way people this is one where I don't have that so they have any explicit evidence but you would think that the people who are most likely going to be swayed by an endorsement are people who don't necessarily have a strong affiliation with either party and that\nIs potentially the one hundred and forty or a hundred and fourteen million people who follow Taylor Swift on Instagram so I Do think that beyond\nJust those numbers we saw about this increase in registration rates at ... dot org the link that Taylor Swift shared and still has\nIn her bio ... page um you know that I think it's an immediate effect that we saw but I Do think the fact that she explicitly endorsed a candidate could potentially influence you know who with its [laughter]\nAre voting for in Tennessee however many there are um it's not something to look at necessarily right now uh I'm sure there's some creative political scientist or communication scholars out there that are going to try to observe the direct impact of Taylor Swift\nAnd and again ... but I Do think it's possible that there are individuals who had such an affinity sweat and not necessarily any in any for the Republican in that race at ... ... which is about how they all tend to ... street she gets for Republicans for example for\nTalk of America as Conrad right now she's an associate professor of political science uh California California State University San Bernardino she's with us to talk about the impact endorsements from high profile people

the ideas that were coming up in our series of Kennedy interviews we'll talk with Margaret Engebretson she's a Democrat running for the seat in Wisconsin seven congressional districts\nFirst us Commerce Department released its latest report on the country's gross domestic product today and it's got good news about the economy economic growth beat out expectations again with the economy growing three and a half percent and the third quarter but the stock market doesn't seem to be overjoyed by the news and some other indicators are mixed when it comes to the nation's economic future\nA county attorney covers the stock market for the wall Street Journal a county welcome back to central time\nThanks for having me\nWe've got this three percent growth and the GDP first of all give us a little one oh one what does the GDP actually measure\nGross domestic product for really measuring all economic activity across the U.S so it takes into account things like consumer spending and spending among says and also of course spending by the government\nAnd we see that a lot of these areas they'd contribute to the numbers that we saw for the third quarter\nOn which is a fast paced that growth is twenty fourteen\nAnd in particular consumers for another area of strength again um and we all thought that that I'm Sorry government spending um contribute to the growth rate that we saw twenty twenty Eighteen\nAnd this is not too good back to back\nBack to back or GDP quarters twenty fourteen uh how good a news do economist viewed as being for the U.S economy\nTwo sided on the one hand I think a lot of people are excited about the figures that we saw today because they do confirmed that we're still sing momentum in the economy um which of course has been expanding for\nAlmost ten years at this point the second longest expansion in us history um but on the other hand I think a lot of folks these days especially when it comes to markets and on the economy are looking forward and trying to get a sense of how much longer this kind of momentum can\nKeep up for and I think there we had a little bit more emerging as they think a connoisseur widely expecting growth to slow down a in twenty Nineteen indefinitely in twenty twenty as well so I think there's a little bit of optimism but folks are still nervous about what the future holds\nArthur ... things that people are looking and saying okay this is a ... for maybe you even indicators that so yeah maybe there was a slow down around the corner\nDefinitely and I think the first one that comes to mind is how to say where we've seen a existing home sales on for four consecutive months at a point um which is sort of amazing when you think about how strong the broader economy looks like and how\nAnother big issue lately is a trade and tariffs concerns about the impact of tariffs on Wisconsin the producers manufactures farmers\nThink about Congress and the nation should take on trade policy\n[noise] well I think it's really concerning that the Trump Administration has put in tariffs huge tariffs on certain countries and he is used uh terrorists as a\nA sledgehammer instead of a scalpel now in some cases there's going to be a need for tariffs but\nThe way they're being implemented now is causing a lot of\nUnintended consequences within our\nAnd as far as trade goes\nTrade agreements we have had business\nInterests well represented at the table but we also need to bring in and take into account labor interests and environmental interests and be more thoughtful about the long term impacts that these agreements have\nWould you like to see some of our agreements like it'd be agreement finally noted NAFTA a renegotiated with those interest in mind labor in the environment\nI definitely think we should take a look at NAFTA and who's being helped here and make sure that everyone has a a voice in this but this agreement has been in place for a very very long time so a lot of the\nDamage shall we say to labor has already occurred now it's unfortunate that we didn't do better planning ahead of time as we a\nTransition into a more global economy but there are definitely things that we can do an important thing here is is that we need you know all the stakeholders involved in making a plan because we're all affected and when we all do better uh we all do better\nNow immigration has been a priority for the Trump Administration and it's a long running issue in Congress we're not too much has actually been resolved what would you look for when it comes to immigration policies in the United states\nThis is a disappointment I Know for a lot of Americans and our Congress has gotten close several times to coming to a bipartisan solution to reform our immigration system\nBut we haven't been successful and now in the current climate with the vice of politics and\nUh you know a lot of our elected leaders and people running for office are using it as\nA wedge to run their campaigns on and it's it's really um unethical and just honorable and many of these cases what is being said now\nThat the current immigration system does need reform and we've seen how\nWho is implementing policy in this nation so what we need to do is address the\nI think it's eleven twelve million undocumented immigrants in this nation who are contributing to our communities uh they're working they're paying taxes and we must provide a pathway to citizenship for those that are\nLaw abiding and have followed the rules the um visa system has to be reformed it's creating problems especially here in Wisconsin for agriculture\nAnd we have to look at our system as a whole and as a nation we need to start discussing immigration policy\nWe I mean what is America who do we want hear how many people are weak and I welcome into our nation or to become Americans\nSo that is that is going to be a long conversation where we you know all voices need to be heard on this but continuing to use it as a wedge issue in a way too frightened people is just unconscionable\nDo you see yourself being able if elected to work across the aisle with Republicans either in the house or or with those in the Senate to try to come up with something that ah all sides can agree on\nI certainly hope so look I I'm going to Congress to try to help make it work better because I Am not going to get there and dig in my heels and not\nUm refused to work with people because they belong to a different party now that doesn't mean that I Will um you know\nFor ... sake my values and my coat of on on what I think is ethical and write most certainly not a that would betray my ... to my constituents into this nation but I Would really love to work with\nA anyone that is truly focused on\nA progressing and getting past this point\nTalking to Margaret Engebretson Democrat running for Wisconsin's seventh congressional district seat representing much of northern in central Wisconsin\nMarketing or birds and uh let's turn now to the national debt we saw a big jump over the last year a ride to Seventeen percent from the previous year despite a growing economy how do you think Congress should tackle the annual deficit the growing national debt [noise]\nWell this is a situation where are the Republicans in Congress pushed through this reckless tax bill without debate without much analysis and behind closed doors and not working with\nA members of the Democratic party who are they're representing millions of Americans and they pushed it through and many outside special interests had a hand in drafting this tax bill\nAnd unsurprisingly at is geared to give this huge tax windfall to the ultra wealthy and corporations leaving in place loopholes like the carried interest loophole and this was exactly the wrong thing to do with the wrong time\nNow what we need to do is in the state of the economy as it is if we're going to deficits bend we need to be doing it in ways that\nAre provides growth for the entire economy so investing in infrastructure we ... we have many areas of this country that\nIs desperate for infrastructure spending much like I'm the seventh congressional district here in Wisconsin education I'm investing in a new technologies and working to transition to a clean energy economy\nYeah we had a caller wondering if you'd consider making incentives for individuals using solar power or other alternative energy sources would be part of your goal\nYes that would be one piece of a holistic planned\nWhat we need to do is reduced carbon and you can uh address climate change\nAnd um reducing fossil fuel consumption by taxing the use of carbon regulating the use of carbon and of course subsidizing um research into a solar wind and new technologies too\nThe stakes are very very high and we are already paying massive cost for not addressing this issue in the form of\nIncreased extreme weather events and it's even causing migration patterns around the world where people can no longer um use their land for farming and this is a global issue we must address\nAnd can you tackle you issue for us of of civility in politics from last year's shooting of Republican congressmen at a baseball practice to this a pipe bomb incident over the last week plus a lot of heated political rhetoric what are your thoughts on that\n[noise] well when I lost my campaign here back in February twelfth of this year in superior where I'm at right now I spoke about this at length in my um my launch speech at is a main reason why I'm running for Congress is because\nOver the years I've seen our politics degrade\nOur politics be corrupted by special interests and big money and the um increasing uh ability and willingness to use 'em inflammatory rhetoric and what's happened here over the years especially since\nAround Nineteen Ninety four and a and a republic Republican Newt Gingrich revolution it is a zero sum\nDefeat your enemy and looking at the other political party is not a one that just disagrees with you but\nThat must be completely um destroyed and that is has caused all kinds of issues it has caused our Congress to come to a grinding halt\nWe have had our our our Congress shut down um our government and and sit there without funding to all these things we need and the American people I don't I don't care what party you belong to\nIs the um the chart tomatoes stuffed peppers and I love them because they're beautiful I Love them because they're delicious I'll nothing because you can make the peppers ahead\nKeep them in the fridge loose and when you have time and you can serve the dish either hot\nWarm or at room temperature and I think when you can make something of that and when you can show that at room temperature rented coalition that wouldn't temperature as it is when it comes and check out of the other hand\nI think ... a real boon for all of us who are busy\nTalking a Dorie Greenspan her new cookbook is everyday dory the way I cook she's with us for this edition of food friday you shared a few recipes with a story we have in my mind by the way a WPRI dot org slash food friday\nThis is a nice comforting sounding food for the fall of maple syrup and mustard Brussels sprouts ... somebody said Rob put together three flavors views are not the three things I probably would come up with but this you say works\nSo well I don't know [laughter] no [laughter] yes it work\nLike around ... if you ask me but but I I Want to hear more about it\n[laughter] well actually recipe ... that's a good way of [laughter]\nUm so Brussels sprouts or you know as we get into the colder weather will vary depending on loop vegetables and vegetables like brussel sprouts and looking for ways to make them more interesting to ...\nReally at the top ... really earthy so much good kind of ... them up a little bit and gives them some ...\n... additional Cory I'm go with\nWith um ... and the meat books are just lounge everything out maybe it just a little sweet against the garlic and the um Charlotte said er vinegar optional put ... great last minute addition to so many that issue like lemon juice\nSomething to just take\nA little game to dish which really comforting\nIt's funny you say that because we were just in the last year or so I think probably inspired by somebody on

first it's time for our weekly review of the news there is some big early voting numbers and parts of Wisconsin Milwaukee health department is under criminal investigation and the wake of a scandal involving a blood testing program and citizens in door county are hoping to establish a national park in their area\nRobert monsters the statewide living and storytelling editor for the USA Today network Wisconsin He is based in Warsaw Rob welcome back\nHi thanks for having me well we've got this election coming up not too far off now an early voting is going on people are watching for early voting numbers what kind of information do we have out there so far\nSo let me preface this by saying that these are these are these numbers are public information they're interesting it's a perfectly fine topic to to talk about on the radio\nUm but the next thing I Want to say is that we can talk about the number is no one has any idea whatsoever what they mean for the actual actions we can get into that um but to answer the question\nUm the urban Milwaukee calling us Bruce Murphy on Thursday was reporting on this and totals from Madison in Milwaukee are by more than sixteen thousand people in Madison had voted\nMore than ten thousand in Milwaukee I'm basically it looks like early voting is going to increase above two thousand fourteen totals um which is the right comparison because that's the last midterm\nAnd those are big democratic strongholds or so a lot of people might look at those numbers and neither hope or fear but that means there's hired democratic turnout that doesn't mean that's what's going on us early though\nRight I mean uh yeah yeah exactly the Democrats want to look at these numbers and see signs of voter enthusiasm\nAnd of course there are lots of signs of of democratic voter enthusiasm not least of which is that\nIn public polls when you ask people argue enthusiastic about voting Democrats in Wisconsin score higher on that than than Republicans this year at this time um so the idea behind sort of looking at this as as uh\nSome part of ... is that\nThis would show that democratic base is so fired up to to vote that they can't even wait until November sex and that could be true that certainly in individual cases that it is true\nBut the other thing about these two places these two Democratic strongholds Milwaukee and Madison is that they are also the largest cities in the state\nAnd therefore the places most likely to have the longest lines on election day so for some people it might not be so much about like their own enthusiasm as it is that\nAnd\nWho do who ends up paying for this how much does it split between what the employers pay and what the employees pay\nNo it's a great question there's tremendous amount of variation some employers have entire premium other employers are asking employees to pay a tremendous amount of it made me up but on average the employer and the employee or splitting the can you imagine a similar percentage or\nSo or on average for single coverage employee ... plays about Eighteen percent of the premium and twenty Seventeen which is roughly similar to what it was years ago\nAnd even but it can present matters because the premiums that's worth a lot of money now to the average premiums are single coverage now is closing seven thousand dollars and for a premium for a family of four is almost twenty thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars a lot of money no matter how you cut it\nAnd you've been tracking this as I said for a couple of decades now and so you have a before and after the Affordable CARE Act did try I mean they've been going up the whole time did anything change as far as the trends are when the Affordable CARE Act got past [noise]\nYeah it's the final ... kind of was filling in a lot of the gaps around the employer system\nSo in some ways portable ... impacts the employers are doing\nYou know large employers now have to offer health benefits but almost all of them already were there was some minor differences like employees now have shorter waiting carrying it or they they are required to have a waiting period Ninety Days before they can enroll in coverage\nAnd out of pocket maximum which most money that way you can enter this pocket on health spending a year that's intact but ... I guess I kind of peripheral issues to system in terms of cost and employer operates and she was eligible uncover which we haven't seen a lot of changes to the last ten years\nThings have been remarkably consistent\nAlthough there are long longer term trends\nThat have\nExisted before and after the SEA employer I still have to figure out ways to pay for what is an incredibly expensive benefit [noise]\nMatthew ray is with us from the Kaiser Family foundation talking about a new report on the costs of health care we're focusing on employer sponsored plan as they don't get always as much attention but a lot of Americans get their health insurance through their employer\nTerm costs are going up there being a ... held by the employers and the employees and Matthew do we know what is driving ah the increase in these costs over the years\n[noise] yeah so it's kind of good news bad news story right the good news is that we're seeing a relatively low premier increase so this year family premiums increase five percent\nSome twenty some team which you know is much less than ... can you increase as we see for people buying up other out or the\nPremium increases be selling nearly two thousand and some ways that's a good story the bad news is a five percent still adds up over time to do a lot of money in terms of why we're seeing\nCost growth that we are is it's a balance when employers get a premium increase they have to make decisions have their plans so they may change their plans to try to reduce costs riffing things like increasing deductibles\nWhich has the effect dolls decreasing their premium and some odd that the employer has to pay for the coverage but ultimately like premiums are driven by one or two things right how many services are covered and how much those services cost so\nIncrease in premiums are because to crush will often driven cares really expensive and lots of parts of the United states\nAnd that's been a criticism of the Affordable CARE Act that it's a covered a who covers health care who pays for the insurance but not didn't always tackle the those underlying cost increases do we know what is making a annual cost of healthcare go up and I think go up faster than the rate of inflation\n[noise] yeah absolutely faster than the rate of inflation Everytime I'm well a lot of its market by market right so hospitals and providers will negotiate with insurers and set prices\nAnd that's the prices that the employer wind up paying so when those prices go up over time then employers and employees end up paying more to premiums\nAnd do we know a I mean those bigger employers in particular they as these costs go up they don't necessarily have the option of of just dropping healthcare altogether is that right\nWell they can um ended Affordable Care act I'd have to pay a penalty for that but\nMost employers don't offer low starts employers offered health benefits before they sort of ... some Ninety percent of workers are at a at a store I'm the opposite benefits firms offer health benefits because they want to recruit and retain the best employees and that's still something employees\nThink of when they're shopping for a new job especially now when labor markets are tighter we there's no reason to expect that employers are especially large employers are leaving the space\nUm we continue expecting corps offer coverage\nNow there is a there have been attempts to repeal the Affordable CARE Act in Congress though that fell short there is a lawsuit challenging the constitutionally solo the constitutionality I should say it'd be Affordable Care act\nGiven what you said earlier would at the end of the Affordable CARE Act it affected the employer provided health care market all that much\n[noise] um yeah like it's a health care system writes a changing things anywhere will impact things everywhere else but ultimately like him ... continue to offer coverage because our employees expect\nUm so which came just thinking of changes in health care system like policy will continue in fact what employers are doing but not not at the core of this\nAnd I've been asking you kind of about national numbers in national trends or is it does it breakdown differently depending on where you are in the country when it comes to the rising costs of employer provided health care\nOh absolutely yeah absolutely cost vary tremendously across the U.S it and are they with even within markets there's tremendous\n... or in terms of what they're contributing towards the premium [noise]\nNow looking at the last Twenty years over all is has there been and you were touching on this earlier how much has the annual rate of increase change are we seeing I I'm putting this in a weird way are we seeing decreases in the annual\nIncreases [laughter] I Know exactly what you mean [laughter] um yes the rate of growth and slower over the last five years but it was over that it was Fifteen Years ago so premiums are grown ... slower than they were\nThat they were early early on the two thousands but they're still going faster than what workers' wages and inflation are\n[noise] and he is that the ultimately means that premiums are continuing ... if you think that\nEmployers substitute health benefits for wages than that than the interpretation would be that premiums continued it in court as much as\nWell that's interesting so I I don't know if you dug into this and particularly in your part are you seeing a these are the costs of health care eating into a salary so a great good news my costs of health insurance didn't come up but I'm if I'm unemployed but I didn't get that raise I might have gotten otherwise\nYes employers will make that an individual decision obviously but I'm the health insurance costs a lot of money for employers why didn't they take that consideration when there\nAre comes in and workers [noise]\nAnd what kind of trends are you watching for it now as as we look ahead again some uncertainty in the healthcare marketplace what kind of things are you watching for now as we go from twenty Eighteen to twenty Nineteen\nSo a couple of things I still think that what\nEmployees have to pay to cost sharing remains really important\nSo most workers will face that you'd have to a bowl or co pay or co insurance before they can use most health care services especially deductibles\nWe've seen those go up rapidly overtime macho pacing inflation so that quits difficult chair cost and people who use services\nSo that trend continues that means for impacts for people who get sick just like us workers [noise] um I think employers continue to think about how to deliver care in terms of networks ... are in their networks and how they can deliver care more efficient\nOr a more cost effective ways to thinking of her dot going forward will be interesting\nAnd of course continue your interest in terms but they're a wellness programs for many employers now have meaningful financial incentives to encourage you to go to ... to ... nations or participate in various wellness programs\nLeave it there for now Matthew thanks a lot for joining us today great thank you now is Matthew ray of the Kaiser Family foundation he was with us to talk about the groups new research on employer sponsored health plans which shows rising costs for premiums and deductibles costs are going up for employers and employees\nComing up national politicians and celebrities are rallying support for candidates here in Wisconsin and around the country will talk about the impact these endorsements have on voters if any and by the way joined WPRI tonight at seven thirty for an election special about the big ticket item the race for Wisconsin's governor\nHosted by WPRI Shawn Johnson in Wisconsin Public television's Frederica ... feels it features profiles of Republican Governor Scott Walker and democratic challenger Tony ...\nLook at their views on key issues like education taxes health care the economy and transportation\nImmediately thought of this race is going to go to Nicholas him because he had the support of an end of Steve Bannon who at the time was so popular more so popular and then um as well as great America pac\nClub for growth money and on the ... we're looking at ... had the n._r._a. and so\nIf I was just looking at those as signals I would've thought you know Nicholson would win but of course the one\nIn ... in a really competitive I'm Rae but\nOverall some of the more surprising things we saw was that I'm\nA interest groups that traditionally has influenced like NRA I'm In this election cycle ... weren't necessarily as if we look at their when record um it wasn't necessarily as high as we might expect I think about it they had a Seventy percent one record or so I'm\nUh fifty seven percent when record keeping that had a lot to do with the fact that they didn't endorse that many candidates an indoor slutty candidates and the same race\nBut that one stood out to me is very interesting\nUm Trump and did a lot of endorsing during the primary that's really rare for president to try and steer a race during a primary instead of waiting until the until the general uh and all the candidates he endorsed one with the exception of two dozen other interesting thing we observed\nI'm but certainly during a primary endorsements carry a lot more weight which is why\nWe were so interested in them and also they signal you know what direction the party is going that was kind of the genesis of the project we were interested in saying which wing of the Democratic party is going to emerge and twenty eight Tina which wing of the Republican Party is going to emerge and we felt like endorsements were good proxy for those sort of ideological variation\nKnow there's a lot of arguments about that I think among Democrats and Republicans so when you broke a do did you see lessons we can learn in an either or both\nWithin the party was was was more powerful in this primary season so\nFor the Democrats he found the party still decide that\nUh there's a political science book called the party besides a that was written in two thousand eight ... says the party endorsement kind of picks picks the winter and the party that people that the party is the official party indoors did do really well they one Ninety five percent of the races but\nThe question is are the party is the party endorsing candidates they're already going to win a so we couldn't necessarily tease that out but I thought was more interesting was this surge on the Democratic side of progressive groups like\nIndivisible is new justice Democrats as new our revolution is new these are all knew\nIt was a very liberal progressive groups and they were getting involved in while their candidates you know they didn't necessarily have the wind right over fifty or sixty percent their candidates are still winning so I think that says that the Democratic party while the\nParty official party endorsement still one there is a a storm brewing on the last um that is quite a change the Democratic party going forward\nCelebrities often adores her campaign with or raise funds for candidates I don't know how much effect of those are but once through that got a lot of attention this year as a swift\nNot often directly involving herself in politics made a very specific pitch within her state of Tennessee awesome people looked at sort of look voter registration jumped off then what do you make of of that particular celebrity endorsement and and the twenty team election so\nYou know your initial question about do indoor since sway people this is the one where I had to have any explicit evidence but you would think that the people who are most likely going to be swayed by an endorsement are people who don't necessarily have a strong affiliation with either party\nAnd that is potentially the one hundred and forty or a hundred and fourteen million people who follow Taylor Swift on Instagram so I Do think that\nBeyond just those numbers we saw about this increase in registration rates at ... dot org the link that Taylor Swift shared and still has in her bio\nOn her Instagram page um you know that I think it's an immediate effect that we saw but I Do think the fact that she explicitly endorsed a candidate\nCould potentially influence you know who\nWith its [laughter] are voting for in Tennessee however many there are um as softening can look at necessarily right now uh I'm sure there's some creative political scientist or communication scholars out there that are going to try to observe the direct impact of Taylor Swift endorsement or\nI'm ... and against Blackburn but I Do think it's possible that there's\nIndividuals who have such an affinity for Taylor Swift and not necessarily any affinity for the Republican in that race that would maybe switch your vote had they intended to straight ticket vote for Republicans for example\nTalking of murders Conrad right now she's an associate professor of political science uh California California State University San Bernardino she's with us to talk about the impact endorsements from high profile people like celebrities maybe or like President Trump or former President Obama can have on campaigns\nYou could join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four as we said earlier we had all these high profile political visits in Wisconsin did you go to one of them what was it like\nA ... if you weren't you probably do who you're voting for already but it did energize the energize you do to make you want to do more stuff maybe for the campaign what do you think of big name endorsements do you watch them do you think they make a difference\nCalled eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eaten\nTwo three four or tweet us at Central time WNPR will continue the conversation here on central time coming
