W. Milwaukee the two touched on familiar themes there including healthcare roads and education funding but they also got into some issues that have gotten as much attention like climate change and immigration Laurel white as Wisconsin Public radio\nAbsolutely thanks for having me\nLet's start with the debates aside from climate change and immigration which will get into in a moment did we learn anything new and big in this debate\n[noise] you know not really the debate primarily saw the two candidates really rehashing\nTheir policy positions in sort of some of the differences they've had throughout the campaign so for maybe some folks that haven't been paying close attention to the minutiae a it was a good primary for them to get them kind of up to date on everything um so we saw them really kind of focusing on those primary issues\nAnd Laurel I Know you were covering this debate it feels like somehow the debates this year in the various races have been more under the radar that I remember in past election even though it was a pretty big election a lot of people are paying attention 'cause that's just me or are you feeling that to\nYou know I think that there's so much going on in the news cycle right now that it's easy for the debates to be overshadowed a so you know I don't have a lot of frame of reference I'm for previous debates I this is actually the first Walker campaign that I've covered believe it or not\nBut um I think that it's arguable to say that there has been so many things going on lately and the sort of daily Rouge of news that the debates can kind of fall behind the rest of that stuff\nBut what people did overlooked this debate your here to catch them up a little recap a little bit about recap a little bit about what they had to say about health care law\nSo health care has really been I think arguably the biggest issue in this race particularly preexisting conditions and required coverage for people with preexisting conditions and both of the candidates say they support that\nBut when you get past that sort of surface level of commitment their ideas of how to provide that coverage are different so they outlined that a little bit during the ... Walker talked about how you can support coverage for pre existing conditions without defending the Affordable CARE Act and the requirement that's part of that act\nHe said there can be a state backed solution\nWhere as Tony ... says he supports the preexisting condition coverage that's in the Affordable CARE Act so that's the big\nWhereas the one in Puerto Rico I find a hyper alarming because it's in a a preserve in a cloud for us to basically\nAway from human people and yet a we have this massive decline ah up to sixty percent loss and buy a massive of these insects that we depend on for so many ecosystem services\nAnd let's talk a little bit before we trying to figure out the cause of the consequences here 'cause I I don't want to be glimpse but I think a gut reaction here in Wisconsin and we'd go to your mosquitoes that doesn't sound so bad but what do we worry about what we see massive drops an insect populations like this\nWell for a lot of people you know they only good bug is a dead Bob but that's really started ... you can't live with them you can't live without um it's more complicated conservation is always like that but\nI'm so many of our fruits and vegetables are pollinated by insects and in fact about eighty percent of the world's plants are pollinated by insects we absolutely have to have\nThese butterflies in laws and wild bees are\nProviding these ecosystem services they are really important in sort of taking the leaves and and dead wood and turning that into topsoil a enormously important they are in terms of nutrient cycling um they are absolutely the hamburger for terrestrial ecosystem so across every\nContinent whenever you have\nInsects are those are the that's the hamburger that's going to make baby birds and reptiles and amphibians and many of our mammals are absolutely dependent even grizzly bears are dependent on getting insects\nIn their diet so I'm I can tell you that spring would be very silent if we didn't have caterpillars for example uh for for nesting birds\nOr that I Would say that ... percent of the songbirds that we really like maybe sixty percent of the birds in the world are dependent on insects you may not like mosquitoes by\nOr you might like your spring to be assured in with songbirds\nRight is this some worry that as the bugs going if you'd like to go so goes the entire ecosystem whether that is a a tropical forest of some sort in Puerto Rico or ah a a more temperate zone forest or ... what have you\nIt doesn't matter so anywhere in the temperate zone or that the tropics if you take away the insects these ecosystems are guy that grind to a halt after two to three weeks or a two to three months we we have to have them if we if we want\nIf we want these birds reptiles amphibians and mammal sharing our planet we're going to absolutely have to have them and then we we absolutely car their pollination services that they're part of what feeds the world\nIs there any kind of hope that OK over a period of twenty or Thirty years these might decline and then they bounce back and they're sort of just an up and down cycle or are we seeing something new here in this decline\nIt's absolutely knew and it's really staggering it's about ten percent declined per decade and and even greater this uh there's a new study out in twenty Seventeen from\nNorthwestern Germany saying five per cent decline a per year just to put this in perspective or what they saw and in Puerto Rico in terms of the decline so if we would go back to what let's have a ah Wisconsin\nSeventy people in Nineteen Seventy seven today when we're looking at that it would have less than eight people so all the all the things that a town would have with five hundred people in a businesses and people employed and all of that would be running fine in Nineteen Seventy seven but by today\nIt only be eight people that there'd be a ghost town there'd be no jobs in town and the economy would be destroyed that's the kind of change we're talking about\nWe're talking about declined insect populations around the world or a dramatic new study in Puerto Rico highlighting the problem David Wagner is with us entomologist a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut\nThe big question David is why do we have ideas of why we're seeing these declines in in different and very different places around the globe\nUm it's it's extraordinarily alarming because it's different places in the globe as you just said it's temperate forest and its tropical forest it's places with people lots of people but it's also at least in Germany is we're sixty seven sites that were in biological preserves and have\nBeen in biological preserves its its across different groups that's pollinators and its butterflies and it's Katy did and so we ... it should be obvious and it's absolutely perplexing\nThat we don't have a single explanation and so that that ... the Puerto Rican study it's pretty clear that it's linked to climate change\nOr they have a two degree increase in temperature there two degrees centigrade temperature and that's that's driving probably more frequent droughts and that's going to be a problem for tropical animals about what's happening in New England in Germany in England\nIs is not a climate change by large decline started before our global climate started changing it may have something to do with climate change but we just don't know if it's pesticides we don't know if it's a changes in land use a intensification of agriculture\nWe're looking uh we we have to find out it absolutely urgent and I think this this paper this study that you're talking about that are triggered your interest is the clarion call for scientists to find out why we can't solve a problem until we find out why but it\nIt's extraordinary that is so widespread in scope ... where where we have to come up with some sort of planetary explanation and it's\nIt's frightening but the other op the other possibility and the most frightening one I think is if the explanation is is that it's death by a thousand cuts that um that humans have reached densities where it's really difficult in terms of their pesticide and energy use and I'm\nA exploitation of land for agriculture and all of that is having sort of a downstream or Catholic I kidding consequence\nSo if there's not a one size fits all explanation it sounds like there probably are different causes is it possible that we could have a solution some global efforts and then some really specific on the ground efforts and local areas the might might help turn things around\nWell all those efforts will will help and we have to you know get on board to do that I mean obviously we we have to have the honeybee and and wild bee so whatever is required to save those or actually increasing numbers is going going to happen you know we don't have any alternative there but just in terms of litter processing\nAnd saving individual species of vertebrates birds that we we love where we can take actions and it's just a matter of identifying what the individual causes heart this point you\nKnow there's a lot of efforts to help migratory birds of various sorts in Wisconsin a cream sandhill cranes for example rank and great and a big part of the story there I Know is\nHabitat and restoring habitat along their migration path right could we do something like that for insects and I I don't know if they migrate migrates much into the butterflies do can we have habitat restoration is going to make a difference\n[noise] well I think that there is light at the end of this\nIs that they produce so many eight so I think their\nCapacity for rebounding is is ten times greater than that uh a crane or a bird you know they they produce hundreds of offspring for female so if we can get the formula right I think we can turn things around in very short periods of time\nDo you feel like this is under the radar you don't have big majestic birds say like cranes you have insects that are are smaller or in a place that people do go that often is this a harder sell to the public and policymakers that he'd this is a really important thing\nI think they're going to start paying attention to this new study in Puerto Rico and some of the day that it's being collected now is just frightening it's it's scary as all heck and we're talking about losing\nA all Thirteen species of frogs that are in this rain forest by you know the middle of the next century\nOr this century actually we're talking about a number of birds that people really care about disappearing anything that's highly dependent on insects I could start seeing rapidly diminishing number so I I think as I said that the clarion call it out and there's going to be funding\nFrom governmental agencies and NGOs to figure out why these things are declining what we can do to turn this around\nOur we monitoring this enough or we lucky in some ways that we've had longer term monitoring and now in Puerto Rico and as you said England Germany New England but is there enough out there enough observation out there to see what's going on\nThat they kill a feeling this whole thing is that we don't you know there's just so many insects\nThat it's been hard to get historical data over long periods of time for any tax on I mean half the world's animals or insects and so\nI'm normally when people think about conservation they're looking at rare and endangered species and we pay attention to them and it's easy to monitor or something like that the sandhill crane even banned them but with insects this\nIs scary because it's not that rare endangered ones who are worried about it the abundant species that are becoming less a button and it's a totally new phenomenon for us to worry about and we don't we haven't collected monitoring data an extremely common species\nWisconsin probably have at least thirty thousand species of insects and as a matter of resources to monitor those whether you're ... you're populations are declining we have no data we have very little historical data except for maybe major crop pests\nWe've been there for now David thanks a lot for joining us today okay good talking with you thanks for the invitation find out\nThat David Wagner entomologist and professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut we talk to them about the steep decline in the global insects population and a series of studies in different parts of the world showing of the decline in the hunt for causes for that to climb\nIs Halloween weekend we're talking about horror and why we like a horror movies scary books and the white ma ts Klassen is with us from the University of ... from ... University in Denmark he's the author the book why for seduce is\nThere are some things that seem like they're pretty culturally specific or a you know prominent a certain time or place but there are some categories that are a lot of things we find scary a fit into I don't want to talk about some of those one is being hunted or preyed upon and you could see an evolutionary connections there can you talk about that as a common theme\nRight yeah it's it's true that it looks like there are variations in and the things people fear um variations across history and variations across cultures but there was also the underlying a stable structure or that the categories that you mentioned one of which is um relation um\nSo so as you say it makes good sense that we evolved if you're a agents creatures that wants to eat is um and\nIn fact that you look back over evolutionary history it looks like many of our ancestors or more precisely those if our ancestors who didn't know the comments that stirs appears\nThey were eaten by predators and in fact we see a predators reflected in ... films in as many of the other categories that are into which common here's a fit\nAnd uh I think I read that you were quoted somewhere saying if you think about it just that a kid's game of hide and seek is kind of reenacting that fear of something hunting for you in a fond Safeway\nYeah exactly hide and seek a chase play a many\nMany many many kids games are in fact a kind of early a live action or simulations that fuel will catch really like that kind of um ... um flirting with danger but you know with kids so you have access to kids when you're\nChasing them around the apartment or the house of growling like monster and\nHiding in the closet as a very uh it's kinda it's a kind of early a or a staging\nAnd another common fear of violence from fellow humans in one of the scariest movies from my youth Halloween has a new a sequel out to just over the last week or two violence from fellow humans another common theme in horror books and movies that one kind of makes sense to do that\nYeah it does and that's really the the the deep evolved\nWhole cycle of slash a film that saturated North American media in the Nineteen eighties as far as I recall more than seven hundred flash of films with the juice and released in that one decade alone course spark by corporate interests Nineteen Seventy eight classic that you mentioned for\nAnd another theme contagion and contamination and you've talked about this time the the zombie thing really brings ... brings up both of those categories fellow humans are I guess former fellow human and they they are going to kill you and contaminate you\nYeah they are I I mean disgusting stuff plays such a huge role in for\nA minute but not all horror monsters are not only dangerous not antagonistic hostile they're also disgusting I think this is on these are really good example because they're you know ... with the case of body and they're on taxes textures I mean that\nThat characteristic of zombies goes back to George Romero's\nClassic black and white so I'm just living that six it but that's a monster that combines the fear of contagion with the fear ...\nI've always been maybe I guess I take casual horror movie fan not a hardcore fancy with horror novel ... sometimes not often he's they're kind of a a numbing effect where okay you start off and if you keep watching these are reading these you need a bigger scarier thrills to keep you going down the road\nYeah you have some new data that suggests that\nThere is such and the fact that people need 'em with exposure with experience for the call off so they glow to kind of need slightly stronger stimulation to get the\nThat the desired effect it it's not a huge I mean it's not that people have really good ... and the effect that jumps here will always makes people jumped in the evening\nUm but but there is that kind of a requiring more at the same the same pleasurable sensation of soil\nThat jumped scare reminds me of a Facebook comment at the idea of network Facebook page from Joanna Joanna road as a kid it was always the jumps scares the gods me it was fun to have your heart's racing was still knowing that nothing was going to actually happen to you\nBut she goes on now the things that creepy creepy outer usually when something isn't quite right it could almost be normal then there's that twist that gives you goose bumps or an uneasy feeling and that's\nYou know I think there are a lot of moments in that David Lynch movies where it may not be something explicitly scary but it's just something that's\nNot quite right it's wrong an odd place in ... county so I talk about that different approach to ...\n... yeah that's a that's an excellent excellent example and I think many people as they grow older and more maybe\nAesthetically or artistic too we um sophisticated they come to crave exactly those kinds of the art full scare which was more about the kind of\nA subtle establishment of an atmosphere that his off um horror films that played with the with the feeling of creeping us which has been categorized characterized by psychologist as a um\nA response to situations that are characterized by ambiguity a threat so one thing is uh jumped scare and that's really easy to do it's not a very\nSmart very artful I'm a scare tactic you just you know a surprise people with with the southern loud sound um ... maybe some kind of visual stimulus as well anybody can do it I mean you can hide behind the ... but it's a pass by and jump out you'll do\nAnd you get the jumps care is total dislikes\nBut establishing an atmosphere that cost you in and and gives you a strong creeping sensation that something is not\nSkill um so I think that's a really interesting to think that just\nProtecting them and ts closet and about how being scared by films movies and video games too for that matter is a part of how we've evolved culturally and biologically he's the author of the book why or seduced says\nYou can join the and an eight hundred six four to one two three four do you enjoy horror films and or scary books\nHas what you found scary changed at different points in your life\nTalked about a couple of different types of horror the contagion or a predators what's the scariest element in a story for you\nOr do you avoid horror movies scary books as much as you possibly can call eight hundred six four to one two three four that eight hundred six four to one two three four no jumps scares when you call in or post

reason is because I understand the offer and what happened to you all for\nOver the years to governors have important to do something to fall both of them under the governor's control\nAnd that was a big mistake for two reasons we need to have\nAccountability ... which means duty should not be all located in one place remembered but governor but more importantly that do need that were removed\nWhich involved of activities corporations trademark uniform commercial code for example are located in fact it's offices all across the country\nFor food they will rule because it's been a problem ... this off of do get calls and emails every day working for those who do you know activities\nSo I think it's important for someone like me or understand if the war with the new governor and legislators to restore those important do you have for the office of the ...\nThere has been a talk over the years of eliminating the office of the secretary of state it's a completely you would take a constitutional amendment to do that or what would you say to that idea\nWhere people have spoken on that idea but they've been trying to do that and this earlier they finally got a referendum on the state treasurer\nAnd the people rejected that overwhelmingly the people are basically spoke on they want to or what the public official they don't want them to be appointed by the government are far more\nCan you talk about the remaining duties of the office of secretary of state and how you are performed at those\nBecause we have which is important is called a puff deal it's kind of an effort to bring it to the uh the international ... says under the convention that me and the ... ... and another lungs or many years ago over countries with the war got together and agree\nFirst Rob I have to take issue with regulation of history as a bunch of ... name of ... I Love it I Know I Know but I don't want our listeners to think that we are boring our students every you W Madison and so in that regard I Would like to think that my exciting engaging\nHistory that brings the past of life is actually very conventional for what my colleagues are doing and your W Madison I got to make a shot at for\nMy department and also probably for our satellite campuses as well\nSo the inspiration for the course I have to say\nCame working with students for years here and thinking you know what are ways in which I can connect history you know whether it's deep deep you know in the past or more recent history really connected to my students that they feel\nThey feel the stakes they recognize that the people who lived in the past are much like them today I mean they may have different world views and moral commitments but there were people you know shaped by larger forces\nAnd so my original idea for the course was actually do a history of their generation so history of your generation and it was going to be a more contemporary history but I I after kind of playing with that idea I realized how hard it would be for students to toggle between\nSomething really autobiographical that might be an even personal in a way that might be emotionally hard for them to then widen out and look for a larger social factors so I just did the next thing that seem logical to me go a generation earlier what is the pre history of their lives\nWhat were what were the social political economic circumstances\nThat shaped who their parents were and so that the idea was born\nAnd for a lot of the students who have the incoming freshmen they'd be their parents are being cut my demographic people born maybe in the sixties and seventies and\nAnd as far as I say I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna eat danger as they age myself ate my date myself uh I was born in Nineteen Seventy so there was a kind of um um I don't want to say unpleasant moment when I realized\nOh my word that's me you know um that that we're talking about um and so yeah the ... I mean the the demographics has never perfect um sometimes\n... some parents are considerably older but yes the course was conceived and for the most part it has paired out that the students who are you W today their parents\nWould be born in you know during the ... primarily during the sixties and perhaps in the early seventies and to be honest there's enough given the course that even if you know someone was born in fifty five or even as late as Seventy six which is conceivable you know that that were were kept the courses\nCatching them somewhere in their young childhood their\nAdolescence there early adulthood and so you know it may not be exactly the same for every student but we are definitely providing that students some snap shot 'em or extended snapshot I should say their parent at some point and they're going to become who they became\nAnd as part of the goal here for students to use this first hand eye witness to history their parents and and I hope we go and talk to somebody about their parent or someone else from the previous generation\nWell in fact that's the that's the first assignment that they have um so what they're asked to do is to interview their parents they can interview one they can interview the other\nYou know in the event that their parents are no longer living or they don't have a relationship with their parents or for whatever reason can't they're asked to interview someone in their parents' generation\nAnd I provide them a survey asking everything from like\nYour first political memory what were conversations at the child you know at the at the dinner table you know when did you recognize what religion you worried that that was something distinct as opposed to what other people happened what major world event was the first one of your memory you know what were your favorite movies you're fashion\nEt cetera et cetera et cetera and then they take that information\nI mean that alone is a treasure trove many students are\nYou know just blown away at how forthcoming their parents are telling them things they they had no idea that their parents and then they take that first the first bit of information and they think about generations and history\nAnd then what they do is so they they use some some work some sociological and historical work on what our generations how can we see conceive of generations moving throughout history and they use it to kind of interpret their own parents through that lens they put it to the side and we spent however many weeks the ... the bulk of the course doing\nReal high octane social political intellectual history of the period\nAnd then they go back at the end of the course now as historians really understanding this period and they re interview there in a much more informed way and I have to say those\n... I mean the first surveys or a blast you know it's just kind of a mishmash of what the students are learning the end the end um interviews that are then turned into paper\nUm papers are some of the most powerful things that I have read as a professor because those students are now informed they can ask very pointed questions about their parents and again it's been really impressive to me how open some of these parents have been\nAbout telling their kids sometimes hard hard things that they otherwise you wouldn't want to share with them\nTalking uh Jennifer retina Rosen hugging a history professor you W Madison teacher of a course called the history of your parent's generation or you can probably your specific details but can you tell us give us some of the kinds of stories you've gotten back from students and their parents and how they fit into history may be ways that your students didn't express\nOh boy there's I I mean\nWay I'm every one of these students yelled something um that\nFor me also well first of all it can be very moving\nYou know because I had a case of up to now taught this class many many times when I think the first or second time I taught it I'm a student who hadn't talked to his dad in ten years\nWow and didn't want to interview him initially because he he harbored a lot of upset and resentment but as the course went on and again we're not doing group therapy at all but just the history gave him some perspective and I don't even know what it was but it made him feel that he could forgive\nWhatever it is he needed to get forgive and there was a broader push 'em on any interviewed his dad for the you know for that and I'm I'm a interview and then and paper ...\nOnce I like to tell if someone found out that he had to have siblings that his parents ever [laughter] up at the parents thought this was maybe an occasion to unveil that I'm I'll give you an example of one that sticks with me and that is and this was several years ago was teaching a course\nAnd we were we got to the early eighties and the AIDS you know there are there early AIDS epidemic in a rock Hudson and the first news about aids coming out precisely at the moment you know when gay liberation is finally\nYou know really making its entrance on American stage and then you have this horrible you know I'm\nI'm an epidemic\nAnd one of my students said to me you know while we were reading this material crossed my mind them might have actually been a nurse in Boston\nKnow somewhere she went back and interviewed her mom her mom was at the front lines in Austin at one of the gay clinics that was you know in the it right at the nerve center of these Killing Fields you know where so many\nAnd so she was able to find out you know she only this vague recollection that our mom you know something about er nurse maybe something about aids but the class how crystallize boom and she went in and she was able to find out and the stories her mother had\nYou know that she otherwise she wasn't hiding them from her daughter but there was just no there was no occasion have that conversation\nI Want to ask a kind of a a conceptual third for all students come out of this because I I read a lot of history and I still I have trouble districts are there is no right there is the president and there's history and that's something different and trying to grasp the idea that\nPeople there and we're living through now and people now are living through history rambling like and then what is that something that's due to now I mean I'm just glad\nHonest it um you just said it that's one of the most profound things that they can get out of the course I mean there is this all sort of by not kill her vision if you will\nBetween they're just moving back and forth between here now their parents now as they are and that then as they imagined\nI mean one end and realizing they're part of history because their their parents offspring you know they were raised by these people and so I Do think the class has this I mean I don't know if we're not killer vision or stereo sound there's a there's a there's a dimension allergy to the class that I think it's very I'm very very powerful\nI mean I think one of the things that class tries to do is for them to see their parents in two ways one\nAs they became who they were in part not exclusively because of the context in which they lived the politics mattered you know\nThe the um the stagflation mattered um you know religious contestation mattered I mean not in everyone's case in everyone's time but you know what you would learn about the seventies and eighties those movements those circumstances those events made their parents who they were\nBut if I'm but on the flip side that their parents were also historical subjects they were shaping that history they were acting back on that history they were the ones wearing the ...\nOr listening to Bruce Springsteen and changing their major you know ... a labor studies historian or something like that briefly\nJust in our last few moments is this for those maybe more as a history of earth people is this may be a gateway drug for the students to say wow this is more interesting than I thought it was before I came\nOut I Love that use that phrase because I think about things that are a gateway drug to the intellectual life um and I think about thing for me that were those gateway drugs\nI think they're for things that we need to do differently\nUm or start doing one is I think we need to ensure that are enforced efforts\nAre targeting large scale traffickers who are sending drugs like heroin and fentanyl and math across the county lines and state lines you know it's a federal prosecutor I was in the narcotics section\nI'm part of my work was working to dismantle drug trafficking conspiracies and I think you know large scale investigations that work to dismantle conspiracies as part of what we should be doing\nA but we also need to significantly expand access to treatment so that people who fall into the trap of addiction are able to get the help that they need to get back on their feet I also think we need to ... who is finally going to be serious about holding the pharmaceutical companies accountable\nFor their role in this epidemic I and I believe we should expand Medicaid and Wisconsin if we do that\nWill be able to cover about eighty thousand additional Wisconsin nights under badger care which means that more people would have the coverage they need to pay for treatment and we'd also save the state about a hundred Ninety million dollars a year that we can put to other uses including expanding access\nShortage and reducing health care costs\nTalking a Josh call candidate for attorney general running as a Democrat here in Wisconsin\nA big issue any attorney general around the country will face is when to join in lawsuits especially at the federal level a lot of times it's uh all the Democrats the around the country on one side Republicans on the other way it is an appropriate time for a state attorney general here in Wisconsin to weigh in on a national\nIssue I think there are two things we have to look at number one is is a federal law or policy harming Wisconsin nights and if the answer to that is yes\nThen is there a strong legal challenge that can be brought to it is a law unconstitutional or otherwise illegal or legal administrative action for example I Know the answer that is yes as well then I think the state should get involved and and this is an area where my opponent and I have clear differences in terms of\nThe types of cases that we should be getting involved in a neutrality was eliminated more than twenty age ease were part of a a challenge to that they currently are part of a challenge to that action I Believe that our age you should have joined that his response was to say that the case was frivolous\nUm when protections for students were defrauded by predatory for profit colleges\nWere rolled back a number of age he spoke out but our age he didn't get involved um he has gotten a state involved in cases and challenges that I Believe it or not in the interests of Wisconsin right so one of the cases he got involved in was a challenge to rule\nThat guaranteed overtime pay for people who put in the hours and make between about twenty three and forty seven thousand dollars a year\nSo he's fought against overtime pay\nFor middle class families in Wisconsin I don't think that that meets the test of is this policy harming Wisconsin It's I think that policy helped hardworking families in Wisconsin and as you know he's one of the leaders right now of a lawsuit that seeking to invalidate the Affordable CARE Act\nWould you try to get Wisconsin off of that lawsuit\nIf elected yes I Would um ... successful\nProtections are going to be eliminated for people with preexisting conditions so health insurance companies would once again be able to deny coverage on the basis of a preexisting condition young adults will lose the guarantee that they can remain and their parents coverage until they turn twenty six\nAnd the congressional budget office estimates that more than thirty million Americans will become uninsured if the major components the Affordable CARE Act were repealed a so that suit is clearly not in the interest of Wisconsin nights and I think we should seek to withdraw from it and as a gee that's what I Would do\nAnother part of the job is defending state laws from legal challenges are there cases where you would look at a state law passed by the legislature signed by governor and say I know the attorney general's office should not be defending this particular\nLaw generally speaking I think the ... office should defend\nState statutes in state agency actions the the AG as the attorney uh for the state in litigation I'm the exception to that is if there is a\nA state statute or a state agency action that's not I'm reasonably legally defensible 'em and you know I can give you an example of of one of those actions recently when Governor Walker\nDeclined to call special elections in a state Senate district and the state assembly district\nI took a look at that statute in it was clear that the governor was required to call those elections I think ... there should have stepped up and said governor this is not a defensible position a and said you know I Can't defend us but instead he he did defend the governor and a judge\nWho was appointed by Governor Walker um ruled that those elections had to be called there I think ... sided with the governor rather than what's the state law I'm required\nWe've seen it the federal level there's at least one prominent case where the U.S attorney general has recused himself from an important investigation that you would otherwise be overseeing the Russia the Mueller probe\nWas my background with that I should step aside from this and hand it to a designated a blow me on the hierarchy\nSo I've been involved in challenges to laws that restrict access to voting I including here in Wisconsin um where I was one of the attorneys involved in a challenge to more than a dozen restrictions on voting\nThat were an accident Scott Walker's first term as well as a law that limited early voting to one location per municipality no matter how big the municipality was I met cases is still on appeal\nOr and so because I was involved in that case on one side I Would recused would screen myself off from that case I and the the deputy age would be in charge that case I'm so cases where you were involved in one side I don't the the engine shouldn't be involved in the other side of um after getting elected AJ\nWe're talking

Walker talked about how you can support coverage for pre existing conditions without defending the Affordable CARE Act and the requirement that part of that act he said there can be a state backed solution\nWhereas the one in Puerto Rico I find a hyper alarming because it's in a preserve in a cloud forests basically away from human people and yet a we have this massive decline ah up to sixty percent loss and buy a massive\nFor so many ecosystem services\nAnd let's talk a little bit before we try to figure out the cause of the consequences here 'cause I don't want to be glimpse but if he could gut reaction here in Wisconsin and we'd go to your mosquitoes that doesn't sound so bad but what do we worry about what we see massive dropped and insect populations like this well\nFor a lot of people you know they only good bug is a dead bugs but that's really started ... ... you can't live with them you can't live without um it's more complicated conservation is always like that but\nI'm so many of our fruits and vegetables are pollinated by insects and in fact about eighty percent of the world's plants are pollinated by insects we absolutely have to have these butterflies in laws and wild bees are\nProviding these ecosystem services they are really important and sort of taking the leaves and and dead wood and turning that into topsoil a enormously important there in terms of nutrient cycling\nUm they are absolutely the hamburger for terrestrial ecosystem so across every\nContinent whenever you have insects are those are the that's the hamburger that's going to make baby birds and reptiles and amphibians and many of our mammals are absolutely dependent even grizzly bears are dependent on getting insects\nIn their diet so I'm I can tell you that spring would be very silent if we didn't have caterpillars for example uh for\nFor nesting birds or that I Would say that ... eighty percent of the songbirds that we really like maybe sixty percent of the birds in the world are dependent on insects so you may not like mosquitoes by\nOr you might like your spring to be assured in with songbirds\nRight is this a worry that as the bugs going the insects go so goes the entire ecosystem whether that is a a tropical forest of some sort in Puerto Rico or ah a a more temperate zone forest or ... what have you\nHad to yeah it doesn't matter so anywhere in the temperate zone or that the tropics\nIf you take away the insects these ecosystems are guy that grind to a halt after two to three weeks or a two to three months we we have to have them if we if we want\nIf we want these birds reptiles amphibians and mammal sharing our planet we're going to absolutely have to have them and then we we absolutely require their pollination services that they're part of what feeds the world\nIs there any kind of hope that OK over a period of twenty or Thirty years these might decline and then they bounce back and they're sort of just an up and down cycle or are we seeing something new here in this decline\nIt's absolutely knew and it's really staggering it's about ten percent declined per decade and and even greater this uh there's a new study out in twenty Seventeen from northwest in Germany saying five per cent decline a per year just to put this in perspective\nUm what they saw in in Puerto Rico in terms of the decline so if we would go back to what let's have a a Wisconsin town\nWith a four hundred and Seventy people in Nineteen Seventy seven today when we're looking at that it would have less than eight people\nSo all the all the things that a town would have with five hundred people in it or businesses and people employed and all of that would be running fine in Nineteen Seventy seven but by today they'd only be eight people that there'd be a ghost town there'd be no jobs in town and the economy of it'd be destroyed that's the kind of change we're talking about\nWe're talking about declines an insect populations around the world or a dramatic new study in Puerto Rico highlighting the problem David Wagner is with us entomologist a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut\nThe big question David is why do we have ideas of why we're seeing these declines and indifferent and very different places around the globe\nUm it's it's extraordinarily alone\nThe globe as you just said it's temperate forest and its tropical forests it's places with people lots of people but it's also at least in Germany is we're sixty seven sites that were in biological preserves and have been in biological preserves its\nIts across different groups that pollinators and its butterflies and it's Katy did and so\nWe ... it should be obvious and it's absolutely perplexing that we don't have a single explanation and so that the ... the Puerto Rican study it's pretty clear that it's linked to climate change\nA they have a to a degree\nIncrease in temperature there two degrees centigrade temperature and that's that's driving probably more frequent droughts and that's going to be a problem for tropical animals but what's happening in New England in Germany in England\nIs is not a climate change by and large the decline started before our global climate started changing it may have something to do with climate change but we just don't know if it's pesticides we don't know if it's a changes in land use a intensification of agriculture\nWe're looking uh we we have to find out it absolutely urgent and I think this this paper\nThis study that you're talking about that triggered your interest is the clarion call for scientists to find out why we can't solve a problem until we find out why but it it's extraordinary that it's so widespread in scope ... where where we have to come up with some sort of planetary explanation and it's\nIt's frightening but the other op the other possibility and the most frightening one I think is if the explanation is is that it's death by a thousand cuts that um that humans have reached densities where it's really difficult\nIn terms of their pesticide and energy use and I'm a exploitation of land for agriculture and all of that is having sort of a downstream or Catholic I kidding consequence\nSo if there's not a one size fits all explanation it sounds like there probably are different causes is it possible that we could have a as solutions some global efforts and then some relief specific on the ground efforts and local areas the might might help turn things around\nWell all those efforts will will help and we have to you know get on board to do that I mean obviously we we have to have the honeybee and and wild bee so whatever is required to save those or actually increasing numbers is going to going to happen you know we don't have any alternative there but just in terms of litter processing\nAnd saving individual species of vertebrates and birds that we we love or we can take actions and it's just a matter of identifying what the individual cause it's hard at this point\nNow there's a lot of efforts to help migratory birds of various sorts in Wisconsin a creams sandhill cranes for example rank and grapes and a big part of the story there I Know is habitat\nAnd restoring habitat along their migration path if I could we do something like that for insects my I don't know if they migrate migrate so much into the butterflies do can we have habitat restoration that's going to make a difference\nWell I think that the fairies light at the end of the tunnel there I mean one of the great things about insects and into conservation is that they produce so many eggs so I think their\nCapacity for rebounding is is ten times greater than that uh a crane or a bird you know they they produce hundreds of offspring per female so if we can get the formula right I think we could turn things around in very short periods of time\nYou feel like this is under the radar you don't have big majestic birds say white cranes you have insects that aren't are smaller or in a place that people do go that often is this a harder sell to the public and policy makers that he'd this is a really important thing\nI I think they're going to start paying attention or this new study in Puerto Rico and some of the data is being collected now is just frightening it's it's scary as all heck and we're talking about losing a all thirteenth\nThis rain forest by you know the middle of the next century\nOr this century actually we're talking about a number of birds that people really care about disappearing anything that's highly dependent on insects I could start seeing rapidly diminishing number so I I think as I said that the clarion call it out and there's going to be funding\nFrom governmental agencies and NGOs to figure out why these things are declining what we can do to turn this around\nOur we monitoring this enough are we lucky in some ways that we've had longer term monitoring and now in Puerto Rico and as you said England Germany New England but is there enough out there enough observation out there to see what's going on\nThat say Kelly's hailing this whole thing is that we don't you know there's just so many insects that it's been hard to get historical data\nOver long periods of time for any tax on I mean half the world's animals or insects and so\nI'm normally when people think about conservation they're looking at rare and endangered species and way pay attention to them and it's easy to monitor or something like that the sandhill crane even banned them but with insects\nThis is scary because it's not that rare and endangered ones were worried about it the abundant species that are becoming less about it it's out totally new phenomenon for us to worry about and we don't we haven't collected monitoring data an extremely common species\nWisconsin probably have\nAt least thirty thousand species of insects and uh the metal resources to monetary though is whether you're ... you're populations are declining we have no data we have very little historical data except for maybe major crop pests\nWe'll leave it there for now David thanks a lot for joining us today okay good talking with you thanks for the invitation find out\nThat David Wagner entomologist and professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut we talk to them about the steep decline in the global insects population and a series of studies in different parts of the world showing of the decline and and the hunt for causes for that to climb\nIs Halloween weekend we're talking about a poorer and why we like a horror movies scary books and the white material costs and is with us from the University of ... from ... University in Denmark he's the author the book why for seduce is\nNow there are some scary things that seem like they're pretty culturally specific or a you know prominent a certain time or place but there are some categories that are a lot of things we find scary a fit into I don't want to talk about some of those one is being hunted or preyed upon and you could see the evolutionary connections there can you talk about that as a common theme\nRight yeah it's it's true that it looks like there are variations in in the things people fear um variations across history and variations across cultures there was also the underlying a stable\nStructure or the the categories that you mentioned one of which is um prediction um so so as you say it makes good sense that we evolved if\nYou're a agents creatures once it is um and in fact that you look back over evolutionary history it looks like many of our ancestors or more precisely those Apollo emphasis who didn't know the government's history as their peers were eaten by um predatory\nAnd in fact we see a predators reflected in horror films him as many of the other um categories that are into which common here's a fit\nAnd uh I think I read that you were quoted somewhere saying if you think about it just that a kid's game of hide and seek is kind of is reenacting that fear of something hunting for you to find a safe way\nYeah exactly hide and seek a chase play a many many many many kids comes on packed a kind of early a live action or simulations that fuel will\nCatch really like that kind of um playful um flirting with danger that you know with the kids have access to kids when you're chasing them around the apartment or the house you know growling like monster and hiding in the closet\nAs a very uh it's kinda it's a kind of early a or a staging\nAnd another common fear of violence from fellow humans in one of the scariest movies from my youth Halloween has a new a sequel out to just over the last week or two violence from fellow humans another common theme in horror books and movies that one kind of makes sense to do that\nYeah it does and that's really the the the the people here that drives whole cycle of clash of film that\nSaturated North American media and the Nineteen eighties uh as far as I recall more than seven hundred flash of films were produced and released that one decade alone course spark by corporate interests Nineteen Seventy eight classic that you mentioned\nAnd another a theme contagion and contamination and you've talked about this time the the zombie thing really brings ... brings up both of those categories Powell humans are I guess former fellow humans and that they're going to kill you and contaminate you\nYeah they are I I mean disgusting stuff plays such a huge role in or a mini but not all horror monsters are not only dangerous not antagonistic hostile\nSays on these are really good example because they're you know the thing with the case of body and and they are in fact in fact just I mean that\nThat characteristic of zombies goes back to George ... classic black and white I'm ... I'm sixty eight but that's a monster that combines the fear of contagion with the two fish\nI've always been maybe I guess I take casual horror movie fan not a hardcore fancy with horror novel ... sometimes not often his they're kind of a a numbing effect where okay you start off and if you keep watching these are reading these you need a bigger scarier thrills to keep you going down the road\nAnd I have some new data suggest that there is such an effect that\nPeople need 'em with exposure with experience ... films they include some kind of need slightly stronger in relation to get the the the desired effect if it's not a huge\nI mean there's not that people really good changes of non and the effect it jumps ... always makes people jumped in the food and um but there is that kind of a requiring more at the same the same pleasurable sensation of soil\nThat tide jumped scare reminds me of a Facebook comment at the idea of network Facebook page from Joanna Joanna road as a kid it was always the jumps scares the gods me it was fun to have your heart set raising also knowing that nothing was going to actually happen to you\nBut she goes on now the things that creepy creepy outer usually when something isn't quite right it could almost be normal then there's that twist that gives you goose bumps or an uneasy feeling and that's why\nYou know I think there are a lot of moments in that David Lynch movies where it may not be something explicitly scary but it's just something that's\nNot quite right it's wrong an odd place in on canning so I talk about that different approach to ...\nYeah that's a that's an excellent excellent example and I think many people as they grow older more maybe\nAesthetically or artistic too we um sophisticated they come to crave exactly those kinds of\nThe art full scare which was more about the kind of\nA subtle establishment of an atmosphere that it was all\nUm horror films that played with the with the feeling of creepy enough which has been categorized characterized by psychologist as a um a response to situations that are characterized by ambiguity but one thing is of jumps and that's really easy to do it's not a very\nVery artful I'm a scare tactic you just you know a surprise people with all the sudden loud sound um maybe some kind of visual stimulus is well anybody can do it I mean you can hide behind the ... but it's a pass by and jump out you'll do\nAnd you get the jumps care the subtle dyslexia but is that what you're going to have this fear that\nCost you in and and gives you a strong precinct sensation that something's not right and that's the choirs real artistic skills um so I think that's a really interesting to think that just to\nProtect them and ts costs and about how being scared by films movies and video games too for that matter is a part of how we've evolved culturally and biologically he's the author of the book why or ...\nYou can join the and an eight hundred six four to one two three four I Do enjoy horror films and or scary books has what you found scary changed at different points in your life\nTalked about a couple of different types of horror the contagion or a predators what's the scariest element in a story for you or do you avoid horror movies scary books as much as you possibly can call eight hundred six four to one two three four that eight hundred six four to one two three four no junk\nIdeas network Facebook page or pick up a conversation coming up on central time\nThis year at Wisconsin Public radio is going beyond the ... we're reading on what issues are important in this election in ... would be more affordable\nI'm an enormous worker so I see a lot of people that are making decisions about whether to buy drugs prescriptions that they need or rather than [laughter] Iran\nTo feed them stories ... around they got the PR guy mortgage slash violent\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin survey center committed to advancing science to innovate of data collection and study design providing Web mail and in person research methods you W.
