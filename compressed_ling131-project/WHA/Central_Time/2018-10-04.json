rising but what how does an employer\nHave to change that our guest says maybe more than you'd thing first the state department of justice released a new plan this week in combating the growing problem of older financial abuse that's an older adults along with other vulnerable individuals are targeted by caregivers family members or in some cases strangers\nAnd either ... or manipulated into giving their money away\nIn some cases the money is simply stolen or the person who's the target of a scam\nOur next guest is here to talk about what's included in the new plan and how it might help stop elder financial abuse Jon Hendricks is the director of the elder Law Center and elder financial empowerment project for the coalition of Wisconsin Asian groups John welcome to central time to be here a while before we can\nIt'll taskforce talked about the problem was older financial abuse how how much are we seeing this well\nIt it's increasing and it's highly under reported a based on national\nIncidents studies we estimate they're thirty five thousand cases in Wisconsin every year of the person's over sixty that are victims of financial crimes and we know that the ... the most\nProminent place to report is adult protective services are some people report to law enforcement some people report to our project but adult protective services gets the most calls and they get about a thousand so that's one out of thirty five cases thirty four out of thirty five are not report it to anyone\nTalk about some of the most common forms this kind of financial abuse might take\nWell I'm\nMost commonly the perpetrator is a family member\nA so sixty percent of the reports are a family members that are a victimizing someone in their family and uh one of the most common tools is the financial power of attorney\nMany people use a financial power of attorney for the convenience and to have someone help them with their finances but also it can be abused and uh that's twelve percent of all the reports are using a financial power of attorney\nAnd is is usually the case where if we're talking about a senior there at a point in their life where they feel like they can't manage their finances anymore I Need that little bit of extra help from maybe a relative you know it\nIt can be both a sometimes people who are are asking for help will choose the wrong person and they'll have a guardian or conservator or an agent under a power of attorney that actually victimize them of course most family members and most\nA trustees are are trustworthy people but some are not\nHard they're already laws and safeguards in place before these new recommendations\n[noise] ah there are certainly uh the things we're talking about our crimes they're specifically a crime that applies to someone who uses the power of attorney it's called theft by fiduciary\nOn this program was are covering a health benefits for about thirty thousand Montana state employees and their families and to the program was going broke and so they were losing so much money every year\nThat they really needed somebody to turn it around\nSo she comes in she wants to make changes and then she started saying okay well how much are we paying for particular kinds of hospital services hospital benefits that kind of thing\nAnd she found what\nWell so Maryland is an accountant and she also you know keeps asking questions and show until she gets answers and so what she wanted to know was how much\nIs her plan paying all the different hospitals around the state and so you know your listeners may have heard some of these stories about outrageous hospital bills and some hospitals charge a lot more than other hospitals for the exact same services\nAnd so what she did she and her team did an analysis of how much they were paying all the hospitals\nAnd there are about eleven large hospitals and the state of Montana and what they do is they compared to what they were paying the hospitals to what they pay\nMedicare and the reason they did that Medicare is the government's insurance for people who are disabled old or over eight sixty five and Medicare actually publishes its prices and so you\nKnow hospitals don't tell you what they charge for things they just charge an extremely high amount and then they give a discounted rate to insure people but you really can't know what it is until after you've paid it\nAnd so she compared the Medicare rates that they were paying to how much they paid the hospitals and what she found is that some hospitals were getting\nGetting paid about twice as much as Medicare gets paid and others were getting paid about five times what Medicare gets paid and so she decided okay I'm going to get all the hospitals in the state to take less money I'm going to set the prices and the ...\nI was going to be around twice the Medicare rate and they can take it or leave it if they want to see the patients who are part of our employee plan they need to take the lower rates and so she started this negotiation process\nTo force the hospitals to accept the deal as she was offering now before she even got that stage it sounds like it was really hard to find out what what they were paying for these individual hospitals there's this black box of ah of costs on health care well it was\nDifficult and you would think that the employer plan that this is a self funded plan which many of the larger employees employers around the country self fund their benefits which means they actually pay the bills that the insurance company\nManages the contract and administers it but does not pay the employer pays and actually technically the employees are paying out of their compensation\nAnd so she couldn't get answers though when she wanted a\nSignal her insurance company to tell her exactly how much they were paying\nAnd teach hospital they actually had to leave their contract with cigna and find a different company to help them really analyze their cars and so once she analyzed the costs and father variation then she had to press them to take\nEmployers you know they don't ask these kinds of questions they don't demand and their health care costs keep going up and so you know Maryland which say and other people um would also say other experts that employers have just been too passive and they haven't been pushing back against the industry enough\nSo she has a pretty good pool of employees hospital definitely have an interest in continuing to serve this pool of employees but what kind of pushback did she get she had had this basically take it or leave it opposite will pay you this rate twice what Medicare pays and not more\nWell you can imagine that the high price hospitals did not like this proposal right and so they went to the governor's office and tried to lobby for other proposals that would not include taking a a haircut on their\nBills um but she pushed back and so you know the lower price hospitals of course signed on to her plan for them that wasn't much of a change but there are up\nAbout a half dozen of the higher cost facilities that refused to sign on and so the first thing she did she took her findings about the price variation to the different state legislators and she showed them hey look we're paying some hospitals two times the Medicare rate we're paying others five\nTimes the Medicare rate we just want the high price hospitals to lower their prices at the lower price hospital skit when that didn't work she said I'm going to take it to the media and I'm told the media they some of you were high priced hospitals and that ...\n... she said got about five of the last six hospitals to sign on you know they really didn't want the public pressure about their high hospital costs and then the last hospital that held out\nI'm what's called benefits hospital in great falls Montana and win benefits held out what they did is they called in the union and they got the union to do a campaign to call the c._e._o. calls the board members call the executives for the hospital\nSend them postcards send them emails and basically bury them in hundreds of\nMessages saying please take the state contract you're you're not going to be getting paid any less than anyone else you're getting twice what you take for Medicare so take the deal and eventually the hospital gave in and took the deal\nTalking to Marshall Allen from pro public eye he used to hearing the story of one major employer a public or the state of Montana\nOr take some initiative negotiating down it's health care costs maybe an example for other employers state and private Marshall part too was prescription drug costs and the battle against the spread what did she find out what did she do\nSo the spread you know you wouldn't think that these type of schemes would really happen in health care or in any business but it's really quite the norm when it comes to paying for pharmacy benefits\nSo I'm employers and health plans contract with what's called pharmacy benefit managers they manage the drugs that we get through our employer benefits and I'm pharmacy benefit managers are notorious for this um scheme is all I can call it called the spread and basically what they do is\nThey tell the employer that it cost a say forty dollars to fill a prescription when actually say it cost twenty dollars to fill the prescription\nOr ... through a pharmacy and um they keep the extra twenty bucks so they basically um misrepresent how much it's costing to fill prescriptions and then they keep the balance\nAnd so what what Marilyn did she dug into our pharmacy contracts and she read the fine print and she saw the clauses in the contracts that allowed for the spread\nAnd then she said I'm going to find a pharmacy benefit management company that will give\nEd and the ... and the arrangement and by changing the spread and taking the spread out of the contracts I'm signing up with a new pharmacy benefit manager she saved millions of dollars for the health care plan\nSo how much has a state of Montana and I guess ultimately their employees deceived by these efforts\n[noise] well I mean it's it's been a dramatic turnaround so the the plan spent about two hundred million dollars a year when she took over the hospital billing changes alone saved to them about a million dollars per month\nAnd the pharmacy benefit costs ended up saving them millions more I'm In the first year they made those changes and so based\nSickly they turned that plan around in about Eighteen months um it was controversial because the hospitals didn't want to take less the pharmacies didn't the pharmacy benefit manager didn't want to take less\nAnd she had to fight against the system unfortunately to make this happen but you know she was a very strong leader very savvy woman\nShe's an accountant so she knew the numbers and also they had to improve um because the ... the plan was failing and so they really had no choice but to make the changes and the big quiet and you know the rent\nI Want to think about all the time the big question is is this someone off are you seeing other employers maybe other public employers or private employers looking at this and saying hey wait a minute maybe we should take a closer look at these numbers\nWell so Maryland is taking her show on the road she's getting calls and doing consulting in other states with other employers who want to do something similar and what she would say is an ... any employer absolutely can't push back and we should all be asking all employers\nShould be asking for an itemized breakdown of what their spending and expecting the healthcare system to justify the cost\nWe should expect that were the ones paying the bills and we have a right to know what we're paying for\nOne concern might be that the hospitals in particular might need that extra money from one source because we see reports of them having a basically a lot of unpaid bills either having provided a charitable care one way or another having a write off bad a deck is this something that could hurt hospital down the road\nWell I spent a whole year last year writing about all the wasted healthcare spending it's estimated that about a third of all the money we spend and healthcare is wasted and so I\nDid talk to the hospitals in Montana and they said that they still been able to meet their financial projections while taking less money and that you know they really had not been hurt by the reduction and I'm In the end the payments and so they were\nAble to make the the care they provided more efficient and um at least one hospital I talked to and I also talk to the hospital association said that they had not had complaints\nWhat's going on and I think one of the most effective adaptations\nOf the system of racism to the challenges of the civil rights movement was to reduce it to a really simple formula a racist as an individual NATO system or\nWho consciously does not like people based on race must be conscious and intentionally seeks to harm them and that definition exempt virtually all white people are from the system we're in and from looking any further at ourselves\nSo for the white person who reacts to a conversation about racism or with that the definition and thanks okay well let's not me there are other people were more racist or that I Am so no worries there what do you say to them about how to think about a different way\nYou know I I've been doing a lot of work lately with tech companies and the overwhelmingly uh the employees are very very young around in their thirties they've been raised in this kind of colorblind um idea and they have no skills whatsoever to think critically about racism and\nThe very few people of color that work with them and a black\nPeople in particular are in a lot of pain um because if I Can't think critically about how my race to shake my life I Am not\nGoing to be able to hold how your race shapes your life in other words if I Can't tell you what it needs to be white I'm not going to be able to validate what it means not to be white and that's going to be very unsettling to kind of challenge that very un racialized sense of self that I have\nAnd so the people of color that are around us can't really talk to us about their experience as much less any kind of unaware flights that we perpetrate you know most of the kind of racism that\nThat leads just incredible letter levels of stress for people of color day in and day out it's not really explicit stuff I mean I Would never used the N. word and it would never march in Charlottesville it's not really clear that my oblivious miss 'em and my\nRacist framework I mean you can't grow up in this culture not a absorb racist messages but they come out and very subtle ways I mean so to me um and but they're not sort of the people of color and that's the daily climate or that they're having to navigate\nAnd that comes from well intended people like me and it's one thing to be well intended and not be aware but when someone does point out something you weren't aware of\nA kind of oh my goodness I Would never want to say or do anything racist but don't you dare tell me I just that or did something racist\nTalking a Robin ... about her new book white fragility why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism and I guess a a a defensiveness is what I'm hearing you talk about their the idea that OK if someone's a white progressing says okay racism is bad\nAnd if they're called on racism that puts them in the category of a bad person and that that's hard to deal with\n... yeah you know in addition to kind of a sense of a ... great I mean individual wisdom is a very precious ideology in our in our culture it's really only granted to those of us who are white you know our stadium racial terms [noise] um and so\nWe just see ourselves as unique individuals now we expect that that's how everybody else sees us uh but you know people of color see us you know yes you are an individual\nAnd you're also white and it has me you know you can literally predict oh whether someone will survive their birth and how long they'll live based on their race and we have to be willing to grapple\nWith the collective shared um messages that we get as a result of being in this particular group and and set set an individual is on the side a little bit or\nElse you use it to figure out how what you see about yourself is unique and special and your particular story how will that setting you up into the overall structure rather than how we tend to use our stories to exact ourselves from the overall structure\nSo very common response and you've touched on this is a people saying they're they're colorblind they don't see color a not a racist bone in their body that kind of thing well how do you talk to people who respond in that way [noise]\nSometimes I share a story about I'm standing beside a black man meeting a workshop and a white woman said to him I don't even see you as black\nUm and he said well first is there anything wrong with your eyes because I Am black and I do know you know that and that you can see that [noise] um and if you refuse to acknowledge that\nHow are you going to see racism how are you going to recognize 'em that I'm having a different experience than your day you are and definitely how are you going to be able to support me around the parts of that experience that are really hurtful and problematic it's really a form of\nSaying to someone I refuse to acknowledge your reality\nIs there a strategy that you've found that overcomes that initial defense of this or is this just a a do conversation from the start well\nI mean one of the things that go on for me when I'm doing a workshop our talk is that I have some time to lay some building blocks right I mean if we're operates from two very different understandings of what it means to uh be racist or you know participate\nIn racism then right there we're going to be kind of not being able to talk to each other but I Do try to point the finger inward rather than an outward and so I might you know I also of course want to reduce defensiveness so I might relate to the person yeah\nI heard that joke before or you know I've I've also had that thought and felt that feeling\nAnd as a result of my work I've had the opportunity to talk to people of color about what um that joke is like for them or you know what the impact of of those feelings are on them and I I had the opportunity to kind of put the human space to that and I just can't\nTell that joke or or share that a ceiling without seeing a the face of you know my dear friend\nWorld on Saturday at

from well\nIt's an outgrowth of the Saturday Night broadcast celebrating world music and several years ago\nAnd the idea that perhaps there's something more important than just the music perhaps there is a pathway to better understanding a\nDiverse groups that live here in Wisconsin so I determined that it was a music that can help us better understand Wisconsin nights and the diverse communities in groups that reside right here in the badger land\nAs you've been looking into that flood heavy found how music and faith and world perspective in an elite fit together\nWell instead of using the word faith I use the word\nSpiritual and in many cases I use the word sacred because in some traditions what is sacred is not something typically associated with either faith\nOr liturgy or some setting in which people gather a like many of the major religions in the world and so I look at sacred Mrs for example when people gather together to have conversation every day and it becomes part of their ritual\nIt becomes part of celebrating that community and they tell stories and they say ... sing songs and they relate to each other and they talk about how their husbands are off fishing they've been gone far too long and they wish they were home and perhaps their kids are bad and they're washing clothes and it becomes something they ... they do every single day of that experience\nDraws them together as a community and so that in my view\nIs very sacred because it's tradition it's at a fine it celebrates that group in that community\nWhat I Love about what you just said is that often when we use the word sacred are here and we think lofty we think almost an approachable and what you just described is really the fabric of of the most common shared human experience\nWell it's the commonalities and the unique\nEmbrace of traditions and it can be both there's nothing on sacred about higher deities\nIn this case what I'm proposing and what my research is discovered Sullivan flawed but much of a very consistent and it says to me the communities that I visited throughout the world that the deepest\nHeld sentiments about groups all around the globe are found in their sacred traditions spiritual communal\nA ceremonial and of course those things that are rooted in what we term traditional liturgy Z and that is much more encompassing much more celebratory and I think it's at a fine and I think if we look at those elements of how people embrace tradition\nWill find there is a pathway to better understanding each other and I think that's what music does it allows us to hear to grow our ears and to learn more about diverse communities here in Wisconsin\nParticular uh angle of culture that we are steeped in from birth\nWhat traditions\nWhat what musical expression of the sacred have you encountered in Wisconsin or around the globe that have really touched you that that are not something that came from your own background in your own experience\nWell that's one of the challenges is that to get out of\nMy own way was it was an issue to set aside my biased interpretations from from the beginning\nTo look at how other people perceive the world live each other those who are different that's part of the challenge and I think that's what's important about understanding people who are different is to see them not as the stranger but as the friend\nThe friend who is welcomed\nLike so many traditions suggest that are followers practitioners should do in some cases their traditions that say you must welcome the stranger\nAnd do it in a way that's wholesome and at a fine and so that is the challenge for all of us to get beyond our own expressions or own traditions how we grew up whether it was in a traditional church or something that people see as the other and embrace them all in the spirit of good community\n[noise] of course it's wonderful when we can really like you said do research delve into backgrounds and different um\nConcepts and expressions than we might know ourselves personally but is there also something to be said for when you encounter something that is different and new to just kind of letting it wash over you in any kind of feeling it as as something new and exciting\nWell it's okay not to feel it it's okay not to want to endorse it what is not okay is to ignore it or to marginalize it\nSo when you listen to a piece of music you may say oh it's not my favorite style but to have some understanding of what that particular piece of music or the genre of music represents is very very important because what people tend not to understand the marginalized and what they marginalize the often hate and what they hate\nThey turn their back on and in some cases we found tragically they kill so the mission and part of the series\nIs to get beyond the exclusionary ideas that are polarizing nationalism racism gender discrimination seen a phobia trans phobia and religious intolerance to say\nThat if we want to contribute to humanity worldwide we must set aside our hatred we must work to try to better our communities and our nation's by struggling\nTo do away with a disease of hatred and to seek a binding cure and I think that you're in part can be found in secret traditions associated with music\nI tell you that Jonathan Overby he's host of WPRI the roads to higher ground world music program that airs on Saturday evening from seven to eleven PM on WPRI isn't using classical music network and he's with us right now to share information about a new project it's called the odyssey series live\nAnd what are some of the specific topics that you plan to delve into trait that series because these are huge\nGlobal concepts that we're talking about how are you bringing down as to like ... well\nThey're not huge for the community that is being celebrated it may be huge to those who've decided that this is the limit of what they're going to define as sacred\nHowever there is an opportunity when you explore\nTo find the commonalities to look at things that exist in many of the major religions and most of the religions around the world hospitality love respect for the stranger meaning the person who is different and these elements in many many more exist in most of the world's religious traditions but\nGood it must be something good rather than an expression that tears down other people that is not part of the focus of the series the series is\nGoing to look at the women in music and how the role of women\nHave helped changed landscape of music making looking you're traditions that were secular moving into a secret traditions we're also going to have some Hindu standing classical music which is very very old and ... that particular tradition in Hindu was him and other religions hope to define humanity around the globe\nAnd what do you hope people who are able to interact with the icy series live well take from this into their own lives and into their own secret traditions\nHope is an extreme extremely important thing to consider but at the root it is about embracing\nSo if you want and have a desire to learn about others then you must meet those people where where they are at in many cases and not assume that they can look different but they must act like you and I act\nThat is not inclusion that is not a celebration for for others\nAnd so part of it is to grow our ears to grow our eyes and our sense of what represents good\nIn many traditions there's such a polarizing effective if you don't believe what we believe then you're something very very bad and I think that's dangerous I think it's a dispersed disrespectful and I think we can do much better in our effort to celebrate people around the globe\nSo what are the upcoming odyssey series live topics and and how can people find out about\nThe well they can find out about them on the road to higher ground page at Wisconsin Public radio but the second in the series is about women in music women in Eastern Europe\nWho historically have created songs that were popular song secular songs\nAnd they morphed into sacred pieces from secular sacred and in some cases those songs that became sacred went back to being secular and we're going to um have a presentation about that particular area of music and particularly focusing on women who helped to create the world music\nSo people can find out about upcoming events on to higher ground page they certainly can thank you so much your walk\nIdeas our director Judas years ... sauce spoke with Jonathan over me about a new

for and some Republicans who might theoretically vote against who are you watching most closely\nI think right now I'm watching Lisa Murkowski most closely on the Democrat I'm Sorry in the Republican side and Joe Manchin on the Democratic side um\nThe the people who had been focusing on most closely on the Republican side or Susan Collins just like and Lisa Murkowski and\nI've seen statements from both to than Collins and Jeff Flake indicating that they appeared satisfied with what they thought in the record\nAnd on the Democratic side I'm Heidi Heitkamp is a\nDemocratic senator from North Dakota\nWho is in a it's a deeply red state and then Joe Manchin is every democratic senator from West Virginia and other deeply red state and Heidi Heitkamp this afternoon came out and said she was

don't want to I don't know I don't [noise]\n[noise] can you talk about the response to that rally including from our Republican senators\n[noise] the the response was the response that we've come to expect I Would say when President Trump does something that is quite out of the ordinary and viewed by many as unacceptable and so we heard\nLindsey Graham say that that was a you know not helpful I'm not sure the exact words to use those three senators that I mentioned earlier just like Lisa Murkowski on both very strongly came out and said that this was not\nAppropriate someone on the Republican side use the word appalling and so there was pretty strong reaction but again that's generally what we get from um ... Republican elected officials\nNobody your side uh well because of that we're going to change our vote there's no at least overt statement but that changes I mean it's hard to\nAnd I haven't heard anything to that effect on not just hurt you know the people condemn him or several people condemn them for what they thought with not being helpful in the past\nNecessarily being something that not that they would sign on to\nI Want to get into some of the possible political fallout from all this are these mid term elections going on a Democrats and a lot of polling had had advantages and enthusiasm and generic congressional ballots are we've seen some Senate race polling now showing Republicans doing better than they had previously\nSome Republicans are arguing he all of this a battle over Kavanaugh's gonna rally Republican voters in a way that they weren't going to get them out of any kind of a lesser gee they had what are your thoughts on how this could all affect mid term elections\nI think that people are focusing in quite closely honor very recent poll that came out that as you mentioned\nMade the case that Republican enthusiasm with now at a level that was fairly equal to democratic enthusiasm while it hadn't been at that level maybe a month ago or so and so I think that has some Democrat concern I read an interesting piece this afternoon that suggested that\nPerhaps whatever the outcome of the confirmation process is may then served to energize one party or the other so for example as it's looking um it appears that judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nAnd the thinking might be that than a reaction to that may be to re re energized the Democrats are aunt that up a little bit but you know we don't know anything the election is\nUm it it's getting close you know but a lot can happen in five weeks and so as of right now though there's been a resurgence of Republican energy I Would say\nAnd maybe a short run and a longer term issue is a woman and how they're reacting to ah the day to day what's going on with judge Kavanaugh what we're hearing from President Trump is this something that might expand an already existing gender gap between the parties\nIt it could I mean if you think back to the confirmation hearings with uh Clarence Thomas Anita Hill that was what kicked off the the first year of the woman the Nineteen Ninety to elect an animal already in a period where over the past year year and a half and somewhat data back even twenty election the\nIdea of women being energized and mobilize and I would think that\nSome of what's going on right now at the cabinet nomination and some of the reaction let's say to even the some of the the shift in tone by people now originally they were very respectful of Dr Ford and her um her\nAllegation towards Kevin ... seen that kind of shift and I think that that might have an effect on how women are proceeding certain candidates and like ... or\n... super energize them for November\nWe're getting the latest on the cabinet nomination an investigation Susan Johnson is with us associate professor of political science at the white water\nAnd you can join in an eight hundred six four to one two three four\nWhat should Wisconsin's two senators due to pretty much committed one way or the other on this but what would you like to see them do when it comes time to vote tomorrow and Saturday on this nomination what do you think of this FBI investigation happening\nOr was it more than was needed was it not enough should Brett Kavanaugh will be the next U.S Supreme court justice call eight hundred six four to one two three four that's eight hundred six four to one two three four or email ideas at WNPR dot org\nWill continue the conversation coming up on central time\nAll the awesome PBS shows ... children love are now available twenty four hours a day and Wisconsin ... little little bit about [noise] whenever and wherever the children in your life\nWisconsin Public television is there for you to watch over the air free anytime anywhere\nSupport for WPRI comes from the international grain foundation in bearable offering a cranes and culture our series workshop this Saturday October sex with paint or Ellen ... information is at saving cranes dot org\nSupport also comes from high von Monroe street a locally owned source for an active outdoor lifestyle with clothing foot where and accessories from Patagonia ... and ... more is at high above Madison dot com\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I'm Rob there that you're with us here on the ideas network coming up health care costs are still rising but what how does an employer have to change that\nOur guest says maybe more than you'd thing\nThe state department of justice released a new plan this week into combating the growing problem of elder financial abuse that's an older adults along with other vulnerable individuals are targeted by caregivers family members or in some cases strangers and either ... manipulated into giving their money away\nIn some cases the money is simply stolen or the person who's the target of a scam\nOur next guest is here to talk about what's included in the new plan and how it might help stop elder financial abuse\nJohn ... is the director of the elder Law Center and elder financial empowerment project for the coalition of Wisconsin aging groups John welcome to central time I had to be here up well before we get to these recommendations from the attorney general's taskforce talked about the problem was older financial abuse how how much are we seeing\nThis well it it's increasing and it's highly under reported um based on national\nIncidents studies we estimate they're thirty five thousand cases in Wisconsin every year of the person's over sixty that are victims of financial crimes\nAnd we know that the ... the most prominent place to report is adult protective services\nAre some people report to law enforcement some people report to our project but adult protective services gets the most calls and they get about a thousand so that's one out of thirty five cases thirty four out of thirty five are not report it to anyone\nTalk about some of the most common forms this kind of financial abuse might\nTake well I'm most commonly the perpetrator is a family member\nA so sixty percent of the reports are a family members that are a victimizing someone in their family and uh one of the most common tools is the financial power of attorney\nMany people use a financial power of attorney for the convenience and to have someone help them with their finances but also it can be abused and uh that's twelve percent of all the reports are using a financial power of attorney\nAnd is is usually the case where if we're talking about a senior there at a point in their life where they feel like they can't manage their finances anymore I Need that little bit of extra help from maybe a relative\nYou know it it can be both a sometimes people who are are asking for help will choose the wrong person and they'll have a guardian or conservator or an agent under a power of attorney that actually victimize them of course most family members and most\nA trustees are are trustworthy people but some are not\nAre they're already laws and safeguards in place that'd be for these new recommendations\nOr this program was are covering a health benefits for about thirty thousand Montana state employees and their families and the program was going broke and so they were losing so much money every year that they really needed somebody to turn it around\nSo she comes in she wants to make changes and then she started saying okay well how much are we paying for particular kinds of hospital services hospital benefits that kinda thing and she found what\nWell so Maryland is an accountant and she also you know keeps asking questions and show until she gets answers and so what she wanted to know was how much\n... as her plan paying all the different hospitals around the state and so you know your listeners may have heard some of these stories about outrageous hospital bills and some hospitals charge a lot more than other hospitals for the exact same services\nAnd so what she did um she and her team did an analysis of how much they were paying all the hospitals\nAnd there are about eleven large hospitals in the state of Montana and what they do is they compared to what they were paying the hospitals to what they\nPay Medicare and the reason they did that Medicare is the government's insurance for people who are disabled old or over eight sixty five and Medicare actually publishes its prices and so you\nKnow hospitals don't tell you what they charge for things they just charged extremely high amount and then they get a discounted rate to insure people but you really can't know what it is until after you've paid it\nAnd so she compared the Medicare rates that they were paying to how much they paid the hospitals and what she found is that some hospitals were getting getting paid about twice as much as Medicare gets paid and others were getting paid about five times what Medicare gets paid and so she decided okay I'm going to get all the hospitals in the states\nAt the prices and the ... ice is going to be around twice the Medicare rate and they can take it or leave it if they want to see the patients who are part of our employee plan they need to take the lower rates and so she started this negotiation process to force the hospitals to accept the deal as she was offering\nNow before she got that stage it sounds like it was really hard to find out what what they were paying these individual hospitals there's this black box of of costs on health care\nWhile it was difficult and you would think that the employer plan that this is a self funded plan which many of the larger employees employers around the country self fund their benefits which means they actually pay the bills that the insurance company\nManagers the contract and administers it but does not pay the employer pays and actually technically the employees are paying out of their compensation\nAnd so she couldn't get answers though when she wanted a\nSignal her insurance company to tell her exactly how much they were paying and teach hospital they actually had to leave their contract with cigna and find a different company to help them\nReally analyze their cars and so once she analyzed the costs and other variation then she had to press them to take less and so a lot of employers you know they don't ask these kinds of questions they don't demand and\nTheir health care costs keep going up and so you know Maryland would say and other people um would also say other experts that employers have just been too passive and they haven't been pushing back against the industry enough\nSo she has a pretty good pool of employees hospital definitely have an interest in continuing to serve this pool of employees for what kind of pushback did she get she had had this basically take it or leave it optioned will pay you this rate twice on Medicare pays and not more\nWell you can imagine that the high price hospitals did not like this proposal right and so they went to the governor's office and tried to lobby for other proposals that would not include taking a a haircut on their\nBills um but she pushed back and so you know the lower price hospitals of course signed on to her plan for them that wasn't much of a change but there are up\nAbout a half dozen of the higher cost facilities that refused to sign on and so the first thing she did she took her findings about the price variation to the different state legislators and she showed them hey look we're paying some hospitals two times the Medicare right we're paying others five\nTimes the Medicare rate we just want the high priced hospitals to lower their prices to what the lower price hospital\nSkit when that didn't work she said I'm going to take it to the media and I'm gonna tell the media they some of you were high priced hospitals and that act\nThe way she said got about five of the last six hospitals to sign on you know they really didn't want the public pressure about their high hospital costs\nAnd then the last hospitals that held out I'm what's called benefits hospital in great falls Montana and win benefits held out what they did is they called in the union and they got the union to do a campaign to call the c._e._o. calls the board members call the executives for the hospital\nSend them postcards send them emails and basically bury them in hundreds of\nMessages saying please take the state contract you're you're not going to be getting paid any less than anyone else you're getting twice what you take for Medicare so take the deal and eventually the hospital gave in and took the deal\nTalking a Marshall Allen from the public eye he is sharing the story of one major employer a public or the state of Montana or take some initiative negotiating down it's\nEmployers state and private Marshall part too was prescription drug costs and the battle against the spread what did she find out what did she do well\nSo the spread you know you wouldn't think that these type of schemes would really happen in health care or in any business but it's really quite the norm when it comes to paying for pharmacy benefits\nSo I'm employers and the health plans contract with what's called pharmacy benefit managers they manage the drugs that we get through our employer benefits and I'm pharmacy benefit managers are notorious for this um scheme is all I can call it called the spread and basically what they do is\nThey tell the employer that it costs a say forty dollars to fill a prescription when actually say it cost twenty dollars to fill the prescription\n... through a pharmacy and um they keep the extra twenty bucks so they basically um misrepresent how much it's costing to fill prescriptions and then they keep the balance\nAnd so what what Marilyn did she dug into a pharmacy contracts and she read the fine print and she saw the clauses in the contracts that allowed for the spread\nAnd then she said I'm going to find a pharmacy benefit management company that will give me I'm a deal that has no spread and the ... in the arrangement\nAnd by changing the spread and taking the spread out of the contracts um and signing up with a new pharmacy benefit manager she saved millions of dollars for the health care plan so how\nMuch has a state of Montana and I guess ultimately their employees deceived by these efforts\n[noise] well I mean it's it's been a dramatic turnaround so the the plan spent about two hundred million dollars a year when she took over the hospital billing changes alone saved to them about a million dollars per month\nAnd the pharmacy benefit costs ended up saving them millions more I'm In the first year they made those changes and so base\nPolitically they turned that plan around in about Eighteen months um it was controversial because the hospitals didn't want to take less the pharmacies didn't the pharmacy benefit manager didn't want to take less and she had to fight against the system unfortunately to make this happen but you know she was a very strong leader very savvy woman\nOr she's an accountant so she knew the numbers and also they had to improve um because the ... the plan was failing and so they really had no choice but to make the changes and the big quiet and you know the rent\nI Want a job because of the time the big question is is this a one off are you seeing other employers maybe other public employers or private employers looking at this and saying hey wait a minute maybe we should take a closer look at these numbers\nWhile so Maryland is taking her show on the road she's getting calls and doing consulting in other states with other employers who want to do something similar and what she would say is that at any employer absolutely can't push back and we should all be asking all employers\nShould be asking for an itemized breakdown of what their spending and expecting the healthcare system to justify the cost\nWe should expect that were the ones paying the bills and we have a right to know what we're paying for\nOne concern might be that those hospitals in particular might need that extra money from one source because we see reports of them having a basically a lot of unpaid bills either having provided a charitable care one way or another are having a write off bad debt is this something that could hurt hospital down the\nRoad [noise] well I spent a whole year last year writing about all the wasted healthcare spending it's estimated that about a third of all the money we spend in healthcare is wasted and so I did talk to the hospitals in Montana and they said that they've still been able to meet their financial projections while taking last month\nI've been hurt by the reduction and I'm In the end the payments and so they were\nAble to make the the care they provided more efficient and or at least the one hospital I talked to and I also talked to the hospital association said that they had not had complaints\nAsk what's going on and I think one of the most effective adaptations of the system of racism to the challenges of the civil rights movement was\nTo reduce it to a really simple formula a racist as an individual NATO system or who consciously does not like people based on race must be conscious and intentionally seeks to harm them and that definition exams virtually all white people\nAre from the system we're in and from looking any further at ourselves\nSo for the white person who reacts to a conversation about racism or with that the definition and thanks okay well let's not me there are other people were more races to that I Am so no worry there what do you say to them about how to think about a different way\nYou know I I've been doing a lot of work lately with tech companies and the overwhelmingly ah the employees are very very young around in their thirties they been raised in this kind of colorblind um idea and they have no skills whatsoever to think critically about racism and\nThe very few people of color that work with them and a black people in particular are in a lot of pain um because it's I Can't think critically about how ...\nGoing to be able to hold how your race shaped her life in other words if I Can't tell you what it needs to be white I'm not going to be able to validate what it means not to be white and that's\nGoing to be very unsettling to kind of challenge that very\nOn racialized sense of self that I have and so the people of color that are around us can't really talk to us about their experiences much less any kind of unaware flights that meat perpetrate you know most of the kind of racism that\nThat leads just incredible letter levels of stress for people with color day in and day out it's not really explicit stuff I mean I Would never used the N. word and it would never march in Charlottesville\nReally clear that my oblivious nest [noise] um and my\nRacist framework I mean you can't grow up in this culture not a absorb racist messages but they come out in very subtle ways I mean so to me um and but they're not sort of the people of color and that's been daily climate or that they're having to navigate\nOut of that comes from well intended people like me and it's one thing to be well intended and not be aware but when someone does point out something you weren't aware of you need to be receptive it's a kind of oh my goodness I Would never want to say or do anything racist\nBut don't you dare tell me I just that aren't did something racist\nTalking to Robin ... about her new book white fragility why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism\nAnd I guess a a a defensiveness is what I'm hearing you talk about their the idea that OK if someone's a white progressing says okay racism is bad and if they're called on racism that puts them in the category of a bad person and that's hard to deal with\n... yeah you know in addition is kind of a sense of a ... great I mean individual wisdom is a very precious ideology in our on our culture it's really only granted to those of us who are white you know a word and he's thinking in racial terms\n[noise] um [noise] and so we just see ourselves as unique individuals now we expect that that's how everybody else sees us uh\nBut you know people of color see us you know yes you are an individual\nAnd you're also white and it has me you know you can literally predict oh whether someone will survive their birth and how long they'll live based on their race and we have to be willing to grapple\nWith the collective shared um messages that we get as a result of being in this particular group and and set set of individuals on the side a little bit\nOr else use it to figure out how what you see about yourself is unique\nAnd special and your particular story how and all that setting you up into the overall structure rather than how we tend to use our stories to exact ourselves from the overall structure\nSo very common response and you've touched on this is a people saying they're they're colorblind middle to see color a not a racist bone in their body that kind of thing well how do you talk to people who respond in that way\nSometimes I share a story about I'm standing beside a black man needing a workshop and a white woman said to him I don't even see you as black um and he said well first is there anything wrong with your eyes because I Am black and I I Do know you know that\nAnd that you can see that [noise] um and if you refuse to acknowledge that\nHow are you going to see racism how are you going to recognize that I'm having a different experience than your day you are and definitely how are you going to be able to support me around the parts of that experience that\nReally a form of saying to someone I refuse to acknowledge your reality\nIs there a strategy that you've found that overcomes that initial defensiveness or is this just a a doom conversation from the start\nWell I mean one of the things that go on me when I'm doing a work shepherd that I have some time to lay some building\nBlocks right I mean if we're operating from two very different understanding of what it means to uh be racist or you know participate\nIn racism then race there we're going to be kind of not being able to talk to each other but I Do try to point the finger inward rather than an outward and so I might you know I also course want to reduce defensiveness so am I relate to the person yeah\nI heard that joke before or you know I've I've also have that\nThought and felt that feeling\nAnd as a result of mine were I had the opportunity to talk to people of color about what um that joke is like for them or you know what the impact of those feelings are on them and I I had the opportunity to kind of put a human face to that and I just can't\nTell that joke or or share that a ceiling without seeing a the face of you know\nMy dear friend Debra for example you notice that the first thing I did was was a knowledge that I can relate to that I probably had actually thought or the feeling [laughter] um but I have some new information now right I I had\nPersonalized um the impact of that thought are feeling and it doesn't necessarily share the person but it it\nTends to have them think twice about whether they want to say that again you know notice I haven't said you're races um you know I mean there's a time when that might be a line that must be drawn but mostly it's not particularly strategic\nWe're talking to Robin ... right now her new book is white fragility why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism\nYou can join in at eight hundred six four to
