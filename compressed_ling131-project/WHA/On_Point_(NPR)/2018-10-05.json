{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WHA", "content": "\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away\nFrom a vote in the United States Senate to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow senators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios\nScott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe mansion we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well and one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote\nThe Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy\nAnd it sounds like if there is for key votes this is going to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most ah let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear a in their entire already over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote it was Mitch McConnell\nWho then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes neither Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their side at but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for the\nUh matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brecht and what's the scene like this morning\nWhile Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young I'm there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away\nOr they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults actual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying we can not\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who has been accused of such crimes have been founded what what they're saying shifts at one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days\nAs well but don't talk about that a little bit more on mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well\nWas poisoning from the outset when President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh from the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest is a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rock worsened when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public discarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and the fairness\nAnd finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty and Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nKnowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf when nominees are brought to the floor leader\nMcConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago\nOr one week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats from moving forward when it comes to complaining about delaying\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction\nWith his nomination in reality again using Democrats as a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience did\nAnd our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford and her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they using Dr Ford of a smear campaign\nGauging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nAs a shameful culmination\nOf the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing to win trench an advantage on our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a ... sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the ignore many us and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nAnd for what for whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh certainly a product of an elite education\nBut also someone with hard right\nDesktop\nOnly vote later this morning\nWell qualified judge show our highest court not any more out after all this\nUnited States Senate will also be making a shape\nWhether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America everyone is innocent\nUntil proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate cash\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy an American pie\nOr will declare that our society cannot and must not well not set the bar so low\n\nSo madam president today is a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge\nBut it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long or on full display\nSo let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been traded to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kaplan always announces the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way to turn it\nCrowds of Orlando protesters\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against a\nMore recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\nYou disagreed with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen days that was incredibly enlightening\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden\nUntil of course a number of judge Kavanaugh's classmate set in ...\nSo stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity the absurdity the indignity\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation mere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was I was a bunch of like clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nNecessary it was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote\nWas called\nFor a fair wage there are France played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat there were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record there were better down by outside about Jeffers and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... awesome what went on\nHospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old trucks so I'm all by boat but here was the problem\nThey all players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination combined we read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus opinions were sworn testimony and written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character\nSo it was clear amount of president the old taxes weren't working but I'm going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive\nMost serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons one\nAllegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the judiciary\nMr actually found this way and all the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for truth the community collected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI\nInvestigation by an embarrassed I heard the facts the actual facts\nProved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence not not was producers support any\nOf the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nOr from anywhere else\nNothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nDemocrats move the goal posts yeah again\nI Believe the latest story you have to hold investigation is invalid and I'll listen to this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nThe latest story as it the whole investigation is invalid\nBecause individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third I Am\nAbout nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses never mind that they didn't actually witness anything they didn't want us any time\nIs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called and there's more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... voted to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and reduce the number of senators that there's ... very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people that are close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely wrong even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things than I Do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast for the medical ... down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of all a lifetime really of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\nMr Kimmy Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live out the vote is ... is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance about the final vote goes until they bang the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a knife edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of Delaware has yet to Delaware when checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for red cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nJeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and their\nIt's secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote NPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering the relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed\nRepublicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only will eggs senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over until it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin is in a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex component has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nIf they could be with it\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nYou know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the mid term is that the terms are barely a month away that's the big ... big delivered for our base that\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy hasn't gap is a lot of the service have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that really arrow to be in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through a political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparently gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters\nAs ... and that was the challenge for us going into the midterms not ... it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up then the people that are kind of fat and happy\nBut now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination\nRepublicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era I Need to win to to succeed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yes\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined\nTo have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee\nFrom a Republican perspective we wanted we want to have a a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely while the character assassination continues\nAnd then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor which is\nYou're listening to the ideas network of

same boats here Maine Republican Susan Collins voted yes to advance Kavanaugh's nomination\nShe says she will announce her final decision it could be I guess it could be a no later today of the four key undecided vote that we were looking at three of them voted to advance Kevin along with Collins\nArizona Republican Jeff Flake voted for Kavanaugh as the Democrat Joe Manchin which is notable because he is right now the only Democrat supporting Kavanaugh's nomination\nLisa Murkowski of Alaska was a key no vote which surprised when people she had been on the fence all along she voted no so it's a party line vote except for Murkowski voting no as a Democrat\nAnd mentioned voting yes with Republicans Scott does this mean that Mr Kevin I Will be on the Supreme Court looks more likely than not right now but again we'll have a better picture later today I think Joe mansion in particular is going to come under tremendous pressure over the next few days\nHe's up for re election in a state

media correspondent David Folkenflik we are talking with comedian and Emmy nominated actor Eli Kemper about her new memoir my squirrel days we're going to be talking to coming minutes about uh her presence and amid a crop of really strong women in comedy names come to mind among others Tina Fey in polar ... killing a\nCamper started to Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is with me in the studio thanks for being with us again thank you for having us so I just want to pick up on something that we were talking about uh uh during the break which is where's the line you guys joke about me to you guys make clear her feminine a you know\nCan be Schmitz feminist higher you know and also yet you have herpes or the comedian do fits a almost backing into being a complete sexual harasser the workplace\nUm how do you joke about something that's so serious\nI don't have the answer and I and the ... been struggling with them and sort of wondering about that every day because it does seem like so much is changing in comedy and I'm ... you would never want to trivialize over little anyone's concerned and so I don't know I don't know where is the line between making a joke\nAn observation and so um I think it's it um it's a it's an enlightening time and it's a powerful time because ladies are feeling a comfortable and secure in coming forward and and of revealing what has happened to them and there's nothing more powerful than owning a truth like that\nAnd I I don't know it you know it's it's jokes that I think you could have made\nA year ago or two years ago art are no longer funny and so trying to figure that out is a good or bad for you I I mean I like a lot of my humor does not go into like you know\nUm that that kind of material so I I'm a by that I mean like I'm not known for like my fence it bold comedy but I think that it is\nWhen writing the book I was I was very my editor and I were very concerned with how on something might come across ... again it wasn't writing a lot of like um [noise]\nUh uh subjects that were enormously sensitive but at the same time something that you might just think oh Im just rattling off a little joke it might not be\nSo for me when is it like Michael Jordan he was like look I don't get involved political stuff because the Republicans are by sneakers just like Democrats or basketball fans to or is it that you actually that's not where do you want to speak publicly you just want to be sort of apart from from\nFrom that stuff to things yes I Am the Michael Jordan comedy yes that is I think that's very your eye on them Logan\nThank you for recognizing natural and second [noise] yeah I mean it it does seem like a a cop out I mean if you you can't not be involved in politics now I mean I I don't you have to you can't not be political now it's the too crazy and\nA momentous a time so I think you can't just say well I'm not going to get involved\nBut I also think that a lot of people are talking to and with people who already agree with that and so I I don't know how much um I don't know how much to weigh in on that because there\nAre out in some ways like the last question on this I Want to ask is you know do you think that Kimmy Schmidt ultimately in the way it handled this in addition to getting less in addition to make sure the humor was pointed out can be a you know advance certain understanding of certain issues on this stuff or do you think that it's hey we're here to make people laugh even if it's in a funny circumstance and that's what we're here to do\nI think there was definitely a feminist I'm a ... an intention when when especially when writing this season for and again I'm not in the writers and so I don't want to speak for them but I\nKnow I don't think it was just about trying to make I mean that's what's so insane to me and why these guys are magicians is because they're able to make these points um both political and seven points while also keeping like jokes that are pristine and just so sharp and funny in in the show at the same time but I I Would no I I think\nIt's too crazy time to avoid that we played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids itself was\nReally funny at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... uh apparently you said you shared a questions about women in comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch way text talk and yet when he fourteen you took on the question that you said that you've been out not just by fans by reporters and the question was are women funny\nFunny yes some women are funny\nI [noise] it's it's hard to have some women are tall [noise]\nAnd you know some women are short\nIf I'd like to ride the train well others prefer to take the we are different\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer introduction where she says I'm that she gets asked a lot like what's it like being in charge of all those people and she compares it to she says oh it's like it must be like when people ask Donald Trump hey how's it feel to be in charge this was before Donald Trump was present by the way and and her point being that nobody's asking Donald Trump that although people should be asking that
