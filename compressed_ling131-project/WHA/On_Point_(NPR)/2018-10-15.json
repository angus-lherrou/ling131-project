welcome to them point thanks good to be here or at first of all let's just jump right into a how the president has sort of positioning himself and his hopes for the ... elections we heard a little bit of that are on his interview with Lesley Stahl on sixty minutes this weekend\nI'm you know he made he responded to her questions about or his mocking of Christine Blasey Ford and the president actually told stole that he didn't want to get into it because bottom line\nA fight and that it's going to help the GOP in the ... the way\nNow justice Kevin always treated has become a big factor in the midterms have you seen what's going on with the polls\nSo enough totally ... let me start with you here what do you make of the president's interview on sixty minutes and sort of how he's placing himself very much in the middle of what's at stake in the midterms\nWhile addressing interesting decision on his part to defend a an earlier speech that he gave where he sort of made fun\nOf Christine Blasey Ford and talked about how she couldn't remember any of the critical details\nAnd he took credit for that is helping really lock in judge Kavanaugh's confirmation I think a lot of people would not necessarily agree with that but we are seeing in the midterms is I think you know a month ago it seemed like the Republicans were going to hold on to the side of the Democrats were going to retake the house\nNow that seems all the more likely ah it seems like it's going to be really tough for the Democrats to retake the set it but they have a very good shot\nAt the house and part of that you would expect to see any way because\nWhile there was an enthusiasm gap more Republicans are showing excitement about the polls and that's something you expect to see is an election approaches but I think it was accelerated by the Kavanaugh fight and a real us versus them dynamic that takes place it's not unusual what we're seeing with Republican voters where\nYou know early on that we're maybe not that enthusiastic but now that they're faced with the prospect of a takeover by the opposition are getting more excited and more enthusiastic so I think some of what the president says is true in a sense of the dividing line to sharpen and I think some of it would have happened anyway\nListening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.\nAt

three talk let's go to Steve who's calling from sunspot New Mexico Steve you're on the air\nA question or comment a reader um\n[noise] we went through a rally in Richmond or ... or ...\nOr for trial and it was almost like a trip to grow all [noise] um [noise] it was just absolutely wonderful uh\nThe or ... years was Schumer's is a ... or ... or ... or a sharp roost a driver or [noise] um or\nHe's still a Steve we're just starting or before it gets you a question because I Do I Do want to hear your question but since you said you went to the Richmond, Kentucky rally or with the president\nThis weekend um and he said it was wonderful I'm just wondering when the president says things that are demonstrably untrue um you know when he basically says the Democrats want open borders to flood the country with criminals we heard that that clip earlier her ... they don't know I don't think any Democrat who they advocated open borders to flood the country with criminal\nOh yeah you know so that you're totally wrong\nTo flood the country with two to flood the country with criminals\nYeah\nThat's correct and my Thirteen out of control\nYes but well I guess what I'm Wondering a Steve is that that the president's asserting that the Democrats won commercials that come into the country no Democrat has ever said that so I'm just wondering when he says things that are that are untrue does that does that trouble you at all\nOf us out on true there is a bribe for current\nOkay uh and so then you're the question that your your\nYour your sadly wrong\nOr I don't think I've heard a single Democrat say they want to welcome criminals into the country but but you were ... the question that you that you had for for for a panel\nKind of a moot point really a question I heard was driven to think through a trail will go easy one day and somebody from him\nGo outside to grow order for uh for [noise]\nOkay well Steve thank you so much for your call a necessarily been David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a a a questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense their early ... what do we know\nWhat I was raised because during the sixty minutes interview the president said something about mad as being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to\nPraise and it probably was suggesting that I'm mad as has somewhat more you know perhaps dovish views for lack of a better term than the president doesn't certain things and that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nUh Madison is going to stay that long after the midterm some veterans are traditionally of time with a lot of cabinet members may leave and perhaps Madison's on that list\nUm I think it's a little early to know where he would go for a replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former lawmaker but there is some precedent for going to the corporate world I think it's early to say but I think it was the first time at least that I knew of that in there had been that clear of a signal from the White House\nThat the possibility that Madison might not be around for that much longer within their\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had to ask the caller about ... what he thought of\nA ... when the president says things that are are on true and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at the Israelis the the president does say things that that we can prove are have no\nNo and no evidence behind them and I ... I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have on potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response to that\nFor people at those rallies and and I've been to a few rallies I I was at a rally in Iowa at\nWeek I think our time runs together with a with a with a President Trump but\nThe people at these rallies at they were so energize they were amped up they are you know they are true believers\nSo I don't know whether they take everything that Trump says that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes but they they are his fans regardless he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people\nOutside and that that that clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they're they're not thousands of people outside but he says these things I\nBut I don't know that at this point whether it makes much of a difference to the people that support him that like ... ah that are entertained by the things that he said in that that the the poor things that he says resonates with them for a swing voters\nIf you are skeptical of President Trump then these things being point pointed out or make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kind of have to start from a place of if you're already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith the that same question to you as as Asia said it seems as if it's the the swing voters who could be a influence or or push either way of based on what the president says ... things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nAnybody can find these swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody's so dug in on both sides\nBut I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture\nTake some of the things that Trump says when he's being a little tongue and cheek we send sometimes take it too seriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea or no he doesn't literally think Elizabeth Warren is Pocahontas but there are things that are that the the\nEnormous crowds don't quite take literally like we do now that isn't it had our caller who said that everything the president said was true and yeah and push back on me several times\nAnd if he can my email is a Smith and Tampa Bay dot com if he can email me the name of a single Democrat that said he wants to open borders more criminals can come in you know I Will happily eat my reporter's notebook [laughter]\nBarbecue well maybe I mean just to jump in the eyes had enough time I mean it may be\nThat he wasn't saying that Democrats are declaring that they're in favor of criminals coming in and that that's the impact of everything that they want to do I mean that's sort of I took what he was trying to say but\nTo me the color you are really exemplified the the extent to which were in this country in a very much an us versus them situation and the people are motivated seems to me ah as much or more by hatred sometimes with the other side has belief in their own side it's one reason I think that as we approach the election\nUh there's more energy from the Republicans because the prospect of democratic takeover pointing to people like\nNot only Nancy Pelosi but even Hillary Clinton as\nA villain who could be empowered if the election goes the wrong way and it's a very resonant with a lot of people and it's I think we're seeing one reason for the energy on on both sides really this absolute a distaste and dislike an aversion to people on the other side of the political debate\nMm well let's go to David who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma you're on the air David\nHi magnet panel I I was watching the sixty minutes interview and I was absolutely astonished that Trump's projection of\nThe street and the viciousness uh putting that on the Democrats um which is something we kept the weight does is just sort of you know smoke and mirrors everything I mean if you look at the Capitol hearings as an example of a justice are supposed to be impartial he does Fox News interviews he brings Hillary Clinton up in his opening statement\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

joined today by ... she's NPR's White House correspondent Adam Smith is also with us he's political editor for the Tampa Bay times and the Taliban David joins us as well he's an editor at the wall Street Journal the Washington bureau and\nAnd we've got lots of comments coming in here's one from our website or on point radio dot org DX oath is the fact that Florida keeps being hit with storm should make them start to think twice about politicians like governor Rick Scott\nWho deny climate change and\nSince we're just talking about storms and climate change we should play this moment from President Trump's interview with Leslie stall on sixty minutes\nA lovely still open with hurricane Michael it asks the president if he still thinks climate change is a hoax now the president didn't necessarily a he said he didn't necessarily trust scientists because he believes scientists have a political agenda uh and then he said this\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions in trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nAyesha Rascoe let me just turn to you quickly on that I mean the scientific consensus is overwhelming that our current climate change that we're seeing is indeed a human driven or human exacerbated just your thoughts on hearing that clip from the president\nIt was interesting because when the when the White House and and when President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year there were a lot of questions from reporters are constantly you know asking\nUh the the White House does President Trump still believe that climate change is a hoax and they kind of refused to answer and that that time President Trump wasn't giving interviews like he's giving now uh so this is like the first time that he was really pressed on climate change since he became president\nAnd he basically repeating even though he's not he said it's not a hoax he's still repeating this idea that he doesn't really believe it or he doesn't think that it's really an issue\n... well uh I should note that the president tweeted today that he's going to Florida in Georgia with the first lady to tour hurricane damage and visit with FEMA first responders and law enforcement or so to that point let's go to a caller here best is calling from St Petersburg Florida you're on the air Beth\nHi uh I'm just curious I'd love to hear Adam perspective on the impact that politics will play on recovery of hurricane Michael because here you have\nSupport for WPRI comes from United Way of Dane County through some at credit union United Way as dedicated to fighting for the education financial stability and health of everyone in Dane County United Way dean county dot org\nKnows are hard hit communities in North Florida I'm actually should be pretty happy that this that everything is so political and we're just a few weeks away from the election because lord knows Rick Scott and Donald Trump or going to do everything they can to look like they're effectively responding to this thing\nUh that said you know you've got some candidates Andrew Gillum a is basically sort of shut down his overt campaigning so he can stay in a\n... in Tallahassee and look look he's involved you've got candidates like ... just the fellow who's running for governor who is struggling to get attention and to some extent Bill Nelson our senior senator who whom Rick Scott is running against\nIs also I think having a little bit of a hard time getting noticed so politics never disappears uh but that said I I think it's a it's a very very big motivator to respond properly\nYeah well let's switch gears here than and talk about ah the increasing tensions and questions around uh\nThe disappearance and as as the as Turkish officials are saying the murder of journalist and dissident Jamal a ...\nAnd the Taliban David or the president's tweeting today that he just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia and the king denies any knowledge whatsoever of whatever may have happened to show the a and that now the president President Donald Trump saying he immediately sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nTo meet with the Saudi king your thoughts on that well\nIt's a bit of a mixed message coming out of the White House and whether that's by design or simply because that's how they are a little bit hard to say uh it's true he did say that about Saudi Arabia reminded me a little bit of some of his comments about\nA president putting you know he says that ah they denied very strongly he said it could be some rogue actors are in the case of the Russians you may recall he said it could be some four hundred pound guy on a bad idea to have other yeah in a base and yeah I don't think a lot of other people suggesting it could be ruled killers unconnected to\nSaudi Arabia um so the one hand and the sixty minutes interview he talked about that there's going to be severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis are behind it on the other hand he's taken the idea of canceling our arms deals with the Saudis off he he he's just\nTaking that off the table a and he's talked about how much he has a good relationship with them but then he turns around and sends pump HBO and talks about getting to the bottom of it and it just I think in some ways a reflection of our fairly complex relationship\nWith Saudi Arabia where they're an authoritarian country without any question on the other hand we have a lot of commercials relate relations with them we sort of counting them to be a stabilizing force\nIn the middle east and the one last thing I just want to say is is President Trump tends to have kind of a\nPersonal relationship with leaders that's how he describes it he'll he'll say whether he means that literally are not that he and Kim fell in love with each other or he and president Xi have\nChemistry it's for him a lot about how he feels his personal relationships are with these folks and it's clear that the leader of Saudi Arabia and had been some you know NBS as people call him\nYou know had a very strong effect not only on a leaders in Washington but also let's face it on many journalists he's a charismatic guy and all these things are complicating factors in\nAs well uh necessarily since you mentioned that moment on sixty minutes interview let's hear it uh this is when the president told Leslie stall that he would be quote very upset and angry if the Saudi Government uh did indeed it assassinate ... but then as now Taliban David points out President Trump also said he didn't want to lose big arms contract\nThey order a military ... everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it\nWanted to we got it so would you cut that off what well what I don't want to do Boeing rocky Raphael and all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a\nPolitician to use a word that's a pretty harsh word but it's true\nThat the president speaking to Leslie stall on sixty minutes this weekend at let's go to Jose who's calling from Aspen, Colorado Jose you're on the air\nOh ... I'm not sure that are of course the government [noise] ah oh first of all er or if you are no longer a\nQuestion from owners your review predicament desert for for for critters over just for free and border military or ... or ... or your gross to the\n... well I Hope they we just heard that clip of the president on sixty minutes saying he doesn't want to or do anything to damage those contracts and that there are other ways of quote punishing a the Saudis iffy deems that necessary so perhaps not\nKnow wondering what your journal is okay for a\nGreat well let me turn to Ayesha Rascoe for her thought ice or what do you think\nThat so far these these military contracts with Saudi Arabia\nTo point out that a lot of these are kind of like promises or like intent like kind of letters of interests are intent\nSo ... and all of the money that he's talking about it's not fully locked in so it it's really um I ... I don't want to overstate the amount of of actual military contracts that the U.S\nHas with Saudi Arabia and he also talked about the Saudi Saudi Arabia kind of just easily going to China or Russia to buy military equipment but they've already invested and US military equipment so it would be difficult for them they can't just switch over I\nAnd go get Russian a Russian equipment or Chinese equipment so this idea that it would be a easy for them to just switch it is not necessarily true but\nTrump is is kind of making this point that he doesn't want is drawing the line in the sand that he wants to leave arms deals on the table with Saudi Arabia\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Bush still does his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nShortage is a policy of the United states\nTo seek and support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation\nAnd culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world [noise]\nTo a different people from two different parties\nThe same idea that you call this policy failure right why\nWell there's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three where we expect that everything was going to go swimmingly and the world we're in today are back in Nineteen Ninety three of the United states is on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China\nA democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nOr the Oslo peace process is underway uh so we're thinking that maybe we're going to get peace in the middle east as well as just ... ordinary optimism\nAdair now fast forward to twenty Eighteen\nUm the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believe the two state solution that the United states has actively promoted\nIs farther away than ever Iran had added a as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before ... signing the nuclear deal but they're essentially a a late nuclear power and I owe a India Pakistan in North Korea has tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat and lots of different places a Freedom House are reported last year that it was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal and tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one\nFinal point um the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the cost we've seen in a variety of different places\nAnd without a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy of ... worldwide is it that it can be the that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places ah Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in Hungary backsliding in Poland or suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transform the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed\nA you know had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS um the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi led into a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better\nBy the way for all of this is going on\nThen countries like Russia and China and Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nA one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop of Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable when in terms of its ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nOne of the questions that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U.S project to spread democracy persistent for so long because I mean we can we went through some\nA part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty that America had to the world being as guiding light for democracy ah but you said that there is an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nThat idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking\nA it's a a broad a group of set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob in Washington that's essentially who I'm Talking about\nBut we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy the defense department intelligence services State Department so they are part of this\nOf this for a whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that right and comment on foreign issues a lot I pretty much daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and often go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about\nUm and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the birth of Gemini this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals and there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three um you see that in the fact that people tend to circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotation soup and uh playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals but\nAs I Want to get to them in in a second about how you did you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but but Iraq is it the disaster of the Iraq War is isn't\nIt it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to dive into that a little bit\n'cause you know you said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but it wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security of the United states I mean that's part of what you say here that the foreign policy elite as\nFrequently are collected issues of security in order to uh to get people on board with this idea of spreading democracy I mean isn't Iraq where the perfect example of that um\nI I think it ... it shows you how easy it is to steer 'em a stir the debate and one of the points I make in the book is that\nThe foreign policy elite down especially presidents in the executive branch have all sorts of advantages in selling policies to the world\nUm and I point out that there's actually a pretty significant gap between what the American people actually say they want they want a more restrained foreign policy they don't want to engage in all these crusades around the world [noise]\nSo how do you convince them to go along oh you do the things that the Bush administration did but again it's not unique to the Bush administration you inflate threats\nYou're listening

[noise]\n\nTo some point I'm making a Chuck her body we're speaking today with Stephen Walt his new book is the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy\nA and professor Walt lots of comments coming you just read a couple of them to you on Twitter pole moves or us is saying questioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\n... says Noam Chomsky debunk this and wall should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion at the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera have been used as a stalking horse for American corporate had Gemini which is highly questionable democratizing influence uh just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all Stephen Walt I'm\nI'm sort of sympathetic to both comments I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very careful heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states is favored to you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations up all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had a particular\nDon't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually don't benefit corporations at all go back to the\nUh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton and oil services corporation to do business with Iraq or to do business with Iran\nCheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning\nBoth of them and then that very same person who has ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts there\nThat's right yeah I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things are things like that [noise]\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that has ... has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in ... and the desire to end that now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger yeah\nBut so I'm just a follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are just some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think at the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks and organizations who know not surprisingly then want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money [laughter]\nAll right well lots of colors used to live at least get a couple of them in here Mitch is calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nI think so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think are under under our current president um who was an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with a well\nI worry that are American values\nAre going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh the uh journalists a highlight that conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nThank you for your call even will do well in some respects I think uh our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and wanted to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well but there are national security or others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to win out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a Saudi journalist ... ... and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it [noise]\nPresident Trump has been waffling it seems to me on this one ah that his initial statements were were quite forgiving he seems to be you know in typical Trump being fashion kicking up a sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it um [noise] it's I think you know the the\nSupport for WPRI comes from the terrible university with the db Reinhardt Institute for ethics and leadership working to build communities of servant leaders who are dedicated to the common good more is that the turbo dot edu\nYour book saying that then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of\nHis view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just remind folks what what the president the then candidate Trump said when he critiqued the status quo of U.S foreign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the cold or a foreign policy veered badly of course\nWe failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nLogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April two thousand sixteen now Stephen Wall we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions the president has made since then I mean about the Paris climate accord about or his a disc discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton talking about expanding the American mission in Syria beyond the Syrian civil war and to\nContainment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region a so here's the national security advisor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran or at a group called a United against nuclear on summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be hell to pay\nThe John Bolton there are Stephen Walt not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is the is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour\nUm I think in the twenty sixteen campaigned a Trump food's not as sophisticated thinker on these things but he did into it or that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lot of people out of their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could town or tried to tell her foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is a ... ah since Trump became president all of his style his approach to the president and his\nUh public style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive\nWhat strikes me most about it is how he has been pulled back in a lot of these same directions\nI'm certainly uh the fact that ah having complained about nation building and we're not going to we're going to get out of the nation building business\nYou know he sent more troops to Afghanistan or as you recounted he's now it seems to be willing to commit the United states to stay in Syria a much longer even though we don't really have an idea of what we're trying to accommodate potentially indefinitely actually indefinitely I'm\nA he has bought a hook line and sinker the idea that Iran is some mortal threat to American interests throughout the middle east and out of course has led him to double down with Saudi Arabia\nA double town or with Israel as well but notice that those are all of our traditional Middle East ally so he's not doing anything different
