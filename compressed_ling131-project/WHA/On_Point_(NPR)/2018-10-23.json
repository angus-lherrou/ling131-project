L. E. Y. traveled October [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about health care and the mid term elections and how much people's attitudes in hopes for\nThe American health care system may influence their vote\nA in these midterm races were speaking today with Jonathan Cohn his national senior national correspondent at huff post covering health care social welfare and politics too man is also joined us Joe is political reporter for\nSt Louis public radio uh and I want to play a little bit of tape for both of you here in terms of how this health care issue is playing out in Arizona I'm obviously a very interesting Senate race going on out there between democratic congresswoman\nChristian cinema and Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally there a vote both are running for Senate\nIn Arizona and this is a moment from last week Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that Arizona is are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection away\n... that it's just a flat out lie again either just classic fair tactics if they turn on TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people a pre existing conditions\nSo the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congressman Martha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Mars and mix Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the blocks that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people who find themselves in how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answer is that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash her record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is that the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways you could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody\nUm but if you want to work with private health insurance and you have to regulate the plants and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good\nUh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good of forgot how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a pre existing condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people\nWho have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full range of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone\nEven if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing condition\nSo the problem and what Republicans have done when confronted with this when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they like that protection for pre existing conditions\nSo they put it in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop or insurance companies from denying coverage outright\nTo other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen\nBy Republicans whether it's the house repeal bill that mix Sally voted for whether if the plan that Josh Hawley floats in an op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will seize on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people with cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than he\n... job man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because I think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as we've been talking about\nBut health care and this this country is so complicated that even when someone you knew who says well versed in it as Jonathan Cohn\nTries to explain what goes about explaining the you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean is it is the debate on the campaign trail getting to to that level that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does\nUm how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick example I've covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly okay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb\nOf one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before Holly began speaking was telling me about their child a had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions and he collars Holly and ask them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this and Holly's giving the answer to that I told your thing and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the Affordable CARE Act this official seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues\nFast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally no these are all Republican loyalists\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave his speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about pre existing conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this and that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at\nParties and events where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWhat will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general Hawley had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him\nYes okay so So Jonathan Cohn that's this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know against because of the complications of health care um it is it possible that no matter how hard Democrat hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P\nThat when a those same GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nYou know we'll see we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um as as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confused people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say extra wide but healthcare is one of those issues where I think instinctively you asked your average voter which\nUh is going to do more to protect your house your words like cares more about healthcare instinctively people associate that with the Democrats now they\nMay they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about that I'm leaving Democrats raised taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know in a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people wanna keep and that's Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing and this is what we have a\nWe even have a Fox News poll recent Fox News full from just a within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare adept and you know and if you look at when it did you know it did to Africa for double check became ... after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\nDemocrats can draw on that reservoir of trust on the issue of health care and use that and I think that's why you see Republicans as desperate as they are and why you see\nJosh Holly and Martin makes Sally and all these other Republicans you know trying to sort of pretend they voted for something that they did in ... you know and and using a ... other ways to try to get on this because it's a big vulnerability\nBut I still wonder that when it comes to that moment of uh actually casting a vote filling in that bubble pulling the lever what have you how much health care will be on the minds of voters at that moment because you know the GOP is running on so many other issues that matter to a lot of voters we're hearing so much talk with a lot of talk about immigration and about jobs et cetera so\nLet's sort of a color simply wouldn't get an answer to some of those questions were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk let's go to Michael who's calling from Chester town Maryland Michael you're on the

much this one issue\nMaybe on voters' minds as they cast their ballots in two thousand Eighteen I'm joined today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering see a healthcare\nSocial welfare and politics and let's go to the bones here because of Lance is on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois Lance you're on the air\nOh yeah I've been self employed for ah twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety five and deal with this whole healthcare thing for many many years\nAnd I I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago for all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama came into effect\nI could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount\nSo to say that the Democrats have gotten a better job on health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford to get a share ministry yeah ministry a type of a contract or live under Obamacare\nYeah Tennessee a quick question is are you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nYou know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle there there is still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to ah pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nYeah Lance thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn ah this I think is this is absolutely the other side of the major health care or challenges that we have in the United states it and the people like labs are right that\nThat we still have the problem was spiraling cost and that it the AC didn't cover everyone who needs assistance with health care so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about preexisting conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\nYeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming of the Affordable CARE Act um you know if you go but you know the the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available only available to people in good health and it had lots of gaps in it frankly the people who have insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial there whereas in your lifetime limit on policies I I\nUm if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill said forego care comes and says we're going to change all that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover you know all the things that employer policy would cover and that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it well what happened was in a ...\nFor people who are poor or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part I'm as income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed the full cost of these plans and uh your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who is now facing just on affordable health insurance\nAnd is looking for alternative so the question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was you just take away or do you say All right we need to give those people like your caller the same kind of access to coverage that people who were lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create a you open up Medicare and Medicaid\nTo them ... you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward but it\nIs it the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation Ole here is should repeal replace or or preserve you know it'll be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternative next steps\nBut we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them it's a simple choice either keep what we have\nOr go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side\nUh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they're all talking about everything from\nMedicaid by and medic I mean this candidate up in Michigan is a list is like and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders and many other Democrats to say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this is a very active conversation that we're breaking through the noise right now but I promise you\nThat if Republicans or lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading intimate twenty twenty presidential election\nWell since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that they will CARE Act\nOr did not solve that cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott really railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act where they say\nPremiums your cost per family going to go down twenty five hundred dollars and then it was almost doubled since ... co payments are up they send you wouldn't lose your doctor now we know that was his ally of the century you wouldn't lose your plan we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said it was going to do didn't do it\nWe have got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott now in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions\nExactly the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional pre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turned quickly now if I can to Reid Epstein he's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joins us today from Washington read welcome to lump ... hot and so uh you know to Jonathan and Joe have been telling us a lot about what they're seeing and races that they've followed ... ... is a pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessed\nTo remember is that like for Democrats running in races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the\nThe most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about but ah I was just in Nevada this weekend a reading about the Senate race there in Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed health care and and the preexisting condition argument\nFront and center in her campaign uh the the democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions on health care\nAnd it's it's an issue that Democrats clearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen by the way that Republicans have handled the preexisting condition question are so many of them are now vowing to protect\nA pre existing ... ... ... previously protection preexisting condition protections that they have voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties see as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay so uh so read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... which hit on it a little earlier but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then a similar plan came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the insurance coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the Affordable CARE Act if I have this right saying that ensures quote\nNot establish rules for eligibility based on health status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but Jonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nNo and it's the same phenomenon we've seen before where it has some of the pieces of the Affordable CARE Act but it leaves out others it leaves out the essential benefits\nA requirement for example which is a requirement that you have to cover things like mental health and now you have to have full prescription coverage and again insurance companies have gotten very good at manipulating those levers in ways that can make insurance either\nUnattractive or unusable to people who have serious medical conditions and don't forget that you know a ... you know we talk about things just in conditions as if it's just these requirements on insurance companies but it's also the financial assistance that less people by the insurance it's also the expansion of Medicaid which covers millions of people many of whom

Y. travel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a truck liberty we're talking this hour with RJ young he's author of the new memoir titled\nLed bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey\nInto guns and we have a a excerpt of that book at our website on point radio\nDot org and an R. J. just just before the break you were telling us about your your first experience as much of this massive gun show in in Tulsa, Oklahoma a but there's so much detail that you write about the justice one experience we can spend the whole hour talking about it um but\nI but I Want to just kind of fast forward to the key moment here is that a is that Charles your your uh your one time father in law are uh he ended up actually buying you again at the gun chosen that right\nYeah and I think\nWhat people don't take from that is that where I'm from Oklahoma\nGuns or a way of life and not always for the reasons that we might think were the reasons that we might read about they are integral to the way that fathers get to know their son yeah\nAnd in some instances when you're much younger that father my buy you a twenty two rifles so you can\nGo on the Web it or or you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something fatherly for me which was by me my first gun\n... what kind of gun was it like twenty six color big look ... why did you choose that one\nAs much as any other part of marketing ship came later but at that moment you know we're talking about carrying we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding with lethal force is we're talking about um\nThe mechanics of self defense shooting of defensive shooting a and we're talking about why some people\nHad been gun buying firearms and a even as far back as twenty seven twenty twelve and what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I was not having conversations about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles yes yeah so what was he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms and twenty ten twenty eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people\nFeel that that is their right and and it is I mean we have laws that say this and people are very very interested in letting everyone else no if you come over here you might not walk away and that for many is a deterrent\nI mean I guess one thing I was wondering is ... ... just before a un after President Obama was first elected we saw a a surgeon gun sales did that ever enter the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks ah it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right and this is the state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have what are called uh at the time or academy sports\nAnd you can walk in there and and by any real caliber of handgun ammunition and how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's there's kind of a surplus and people can't really move firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was in office because a lot of people still harbor to fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and tried to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of salt right for this kind of handgun a and those while you know\nFictitious\nWere also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do it does not matter\nIf what you believe isn't what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word\nDon't tell them to their face that they're wrong irritates them and make them mad\nNow make you there for your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out and that's where I was trying to take this conversation or even before you know I I even thought that I might entertained becoming that good with a pistol and I would get stymied mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about\nYeah you know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir where you talk about uh the day that you got home\nOr or ... or or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had had purchased for you could you read that part of the demand more to us\n[noise] yes ma'am gotta lotta Oxford comma isn't it [noise] um [noise] the day I got back home with my new\nIt on my bed and looked at it for some time I had an open did at the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud\nWhat I felt was something more like fear like the fear I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the being who was so much trouble he drowned the planet cast out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love fear\nThe way I was taught to feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police stay out of jail and stay alive I knew that the first time I lost respect for that pissed on a larger than life\nJust it could kill me or get me killed open the box and picked up the clock I was amazed at how intuitive that was the process of removing the empty magazine putting it back and wrecking the slide wasn't really that easy\nA person with a gun tends to feel a lot like Superman with X ray vision laser site and hope smash strength which is why telling that person to use those super powers will generally result in the person looking at you like your the lunatic\nAppointed a gun at the blank white bedroom wall and my second storey apartment and squeezed feeling the hard click of the trigger the soft half of the hammer and an empty chamber\nI put the gun back in its case knowing that next week the chamber would no longer be empty and that this bit of polymer plastic in metal would no longer be inexpensive paper wait\nWhat a weapon so lethal I Wish we could invent it lets\nRJ young reading an excerpt of his new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey into guns\nAre gay I Wonder if you could explain to folks who are listening to that that X or do you do you showed this deep respect for the power of the weapon in your hands uh some\nUh definitely conflicted feelings about having it at all so how is it that you got from that to being a certified NRA shooting instructor\n[noise] I got to a point in my journey\nThat I wanted to answer one fundamental question that was present it to me over and over and over again as a truism\nThe truism was\nA good guy with a gun is better than a bad guy with a gun and I put a question mark at the end of that statement and wanted to find out for myself if that was true\nAnd us began countless rounds and trips to the gun range to get good really really good like master Yoda on day go by this is how you use the force good\nYeah [noise] and and you did it ...\nYeah yeah I did but your heart outrage and given ...\nBut you know I mean so the thing is is that you have you just you you tell in the memoir and you're describing to us now how\nYou know in order to connect with your ... your father in law and you're just on passionate really throw yourself in understanding this culture that he's so much a part of that you become as you said like you you're pursuing a jet I Dream\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the

J. just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association a I I'm just what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there's multiple there were a bunch of reasons why\nThe association was formed a protection the the desire for self protection amongst\nAfrican Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about a African Americans and gun history in America\nYeah and I got the profile dug for the book and so that was cool and heard his voice in quite some time it's been on tape but that's that's the message messages there is a responsible way to use this there are folks like myself\nWho believe that they should be armed for self defense and there is the historical aspect of\nGuns were taken from people who look like you and that is not something that you get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\nI I hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of African Americans maybe there's increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps ... especially in recent years [noise] but\nAh RJ did you ever feel like you were actually potentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around a question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was a legal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident\nSpeech more to watch the n._r._a. should have done and an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like ... and like dumped Jefferson and the people for which that organization represents but in regard to me I'm going to help me man a magnet let me\nLet let me let me break it down a I walked into studio right where I'm a member of chaos you shut up and I have on a Black Panther sure Scott ... on it because that's what the movie's really about I have on a Black Panther at\nWhat kind of stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have locks that are rated up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't going to be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm dressed and also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not um I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go around as if that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around as if a gun in a room is not bigger than any elephant you can walk in there\nYou're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say and that's not correct and that's not right but it is true it is a fear\nSo in the course of\nGetting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist and I am asking questions and I'm looking at data and I'm looking at statistics and I'm taking account of my own experience and what I come to flat out is not only am I not safer\nI'm In more danger if I have a gun on my person if I have a gun within reach\nHey I'm thinking about your former father in law Charles now did did you ever have did you ever tell them this that that the the very same\nDesire for self protection that made it made him such a firearms enthusiast or even if you shared that desire you actually felt less safe a ... because of the fact of race in America when you had the weapon then before you didn't is that something that he he he understood\nLater later as we continue to go through this and later as I had my credentials as I had a standing firm which do you have to continue this discussion like we had spoken about I hadn't fired a gun but I also was able to outline this in the book with a use of force attorney here in Oklahoma\nAnd he had a similar discussion with a friend of his uh his attorney was white his friend is black and his friend who he was\nReally respect for four of and was reading about that hey man when I get pulled over and you get pulled over it's just different and I don't need you to tell me that it's not I don't need you to tell me that people should not judge me by the color of my skin I Need you to recognize that it does happen and to support me\nIn a way you can support me is to speak up for me in the rooms\nI might not ever walk into and I thought that was where I got you with Charles I could see that toward the end yeah well\nOur Jay hang on here for just a second so many interesting people about this conversation uh or or about this issue I should say I want to bring in one more voice Tiffany where joins us now she is joining us from Cincinnati, Ohio and chief founder of the brown girls project to be a group that offers\nMakeup workshops and other activities for building self esteem in African American women and girls and she also organizes firearms training classes for African American women Tiffany where welcome to appoint\nHello hello hello thank you for me\nSo so how long have you been a gun owner and the teaching the organizing firearms classes\nI'm organizing the fire on classes side under Twenty one a couple of years I'm owning one for about a year\nOkay and so and before that and guns and your family\nI'm not really a I have a grandfather from ... Georgia though he was a hunter um so you know he had an old shot gun that he kept in the house yet five daughters and two granddaughters and we knew that what that was but that\nWas a trainee no interacting with it\nI see so what what uh what was the reason that took you to buy a gun\n[noise] um actually it it it was the new I don't want to say new but this heightened racial tense climate and the area that I live in\nUm that made me say I need to be able to protect myself and as a single mother or be able to protect my children\nUm during the Trump campaign and you know\nMy children were very very um tuned into what was happening but have a new uh politics and they were able to feel the potential to drive as well\nUm and they were very concerned and when a Trump gotten off as my son who was Fifteen at the time was very emotional about it and he he was concerned\nHow what was going to happen to us people were being um okay to be more aggressive to say things that they didn't say before who are either they invade your your personal space and he'd heard all these stories what if somebody does something to us\nAnd him being you know I have a son or daughter and then it myself you've got to go I have to protect you guys and I'm like no way could that's my job and then I thought about it like how would I really\nDo do you ... are you Hannah I'm ... I'm Sorry I didn't I didn't mean to interrupt there but do you really do you feel now that having a gun has made you and your families safer\n[noise] um [noise] I feel protected I feel that if someone crosses my threshold I have something other than my sister and iron to throw\n'em I feel that at night when my kids were coming home for extra curricular activity and the seasons change and it's gotten darker um if someone were to approach it I definitely feel like I'm I can handle myself and and make it safe\nYeah uh ... what do you what do you have to say the Tiffany 'cause I I I hear her and I hear the voice of someone who feels\nBut uh the the places that we usually look for protection in society\nGovernment law enforcement et cetera and uh our fellow citizens that there's a failure there which is why she felt she she needed to to buy a firearm a to protect her and her kids\nThat perhaps a sense of society feeling us is also a reason why a lot of white gun owners buy a gun and it just to me feels\nI understand Tiffany's desire of course every parent wants to protect\nEach other if we're turning to weapons as a means means for protection", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "23"}
