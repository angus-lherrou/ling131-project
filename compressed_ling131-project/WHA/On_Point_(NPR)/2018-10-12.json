and all weekend on NPR's broadcasts and also on line that NPR\nDot org I Do want to turn to uh\nTo the climate report done by the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental planted a panel on climate change as commissioned by the United nations uh which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage during an interview with on point on Tuesday drew ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explained that past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative\nAnd that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe've seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of extremes go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or have if anything been kind of too conservative and we're now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we went back in the eighties\n[noise] totally ... uh how is the government responding to this a panel just at this report\nI without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives that much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know try to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nA ... and has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pull out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states than agreement that basically all of the countries in the world agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact than the onset of of climate change uh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and uh as you said putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet [noise] uh\nI'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob your\nJake my call Yes sir I think that I think the biggest driver of climate change is not all people in their everyday lives turn away from it there's no bigger issue in this report anything it tells me that people who claimed to\nSay that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing force in those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a Bob uh Alexis I'm asked totally what actions have been taken a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\nWell I you know one element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and uh the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we discovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if\nThis report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas the\nThe issues at stake are quite dire indeed this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of a new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine a Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of a a a ceremonial swearing in that as he'd already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House\nUh and at that time the newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh assured Americans he would be an independent impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of\nThe Supreme Court team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nJack Beatty or you've hurt the new justice or can you uh feel assured that he'll listen to the litigants arguments with respect or an open mind\nWell he had to say that didn't they are based on his little Philip it couldn't front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except big guys the come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nUh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him a lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough the challenge this poses to the GOP or some people call it the ground oil party which is deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames hence the climate scientist and a recent paper said either we will go to negative admissions now basically or we will have to invest\nOver the next century just pulled the carbon it's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies what does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need the universal health care\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from the cost of the party the cost joined by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about uh the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization will crisis Alexis them ending\nOr is there any sense going back to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that are that the Republicans will pay a price for a for a cabin are what they it doesn't now look as though there'll be a little bit used by the the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these races very carefully there suggesting I'm taking a Mitch McConnell who's been doing some victory lap sort of interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to the polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling a hat or doing better than they thought they might in\nA state that they would normally be thought of to be winning and a Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is eager to say that that little bumpy thinks it's coming from what happened with cabin on fact\nAs you know in the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect\nEven though he said it wasn't planned that way to be so contentious right before the election I'm at and a Democrat is not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated and might themselves be very motivated about what they saw particularly women\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

analyst Jack Beatty you can join the conversation what other stories are moving you this week what's on your radar what's not getting enough coverage where one hundred forty three eight to five five ... hundred for two three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook\nAt on point radio or one of our callers are called to admonished us for spending time on Kanye West visit the White House at all but I think it's part of a piece of understanding where the president is coming from what's on his mental landscape what does he sharing with us\nHe also had some a sharp words at a rally a in Council Bluffs Iowa on Tuesday the president had harsh words for those who oppose him\nHand match during our citizens and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\nWe've heard a lot of rhetoric from Republicans about the Democrats in their opponents being object ... what does this rhetoric coming from\n[noise] well yeah and you know let's just get a job for the test was called the Democrats evil the party of crime they want to destroy our country liberals are quote very very bad people\nYou know in the ah October nineteenth to thousands sixteen debate the president was that then candidate Trump was asked will you will abide by the results of the election\nAnd he said I Will look at it at the time I Will keep you in suspense it could be rigged\nNow we have to be in suspense about two thousand and twenty is it likely that the president will turn over power should the Democrats win to a party that is what destroying our country very very evil\nYou know you have it we have reached the point where this sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is ed lose\nMy heavens writing in the Financial Times it's no leap to imagine Trump refusing to accept election defeat that that's a along\nStep from where we are but certainly the rhetoric is charged he's talking about mob rule Alexa ... you've been hearing that from a congressional figure some of them on Capitol Hill as well what are you hearing that's driving that rhetoric what did they point to and and ... you know what is it really grounded on\nWell first of all when we first started to hear this discussion about an angry mob it was a talking point it was very clear because Republicans including the president were all speaking with the same voice so it had been focus grouped with a talking point and pollsters were suggesting that Republicans would profit by doing this\nAnd part of this is because in elections\nTo draw very sharp contrast and mobilize your own base to turn out and we know that Republicans had been very concerned that their base is not as mobilized or as excited about turning out in the mid term election and the Democrats may be so I don't\nLook yeah let me just stop you there to help underscore your point a during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend ... valley resident Dorothy nickloes told our co host magnet chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protests from Democrats\nThe Democratic party out so far to the left and\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots\nVersus the socialists and ... and ... until\n... sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around with Philippe ads on their heads and science and everything that goes I mean they're just they're everywhere\nAnd that's from one point said field reporting from Pennsylvania a in that case about outing rational redistricting the redistricting is affecting states\nHotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point radio dot org but electric to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of mob than simply the people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly is a constitutional right that's hardly seems like ... to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line that of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself has very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nAre often insights a mob reaction himself\nBut I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to drop sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race in New York and defeated a Joe Crowley long term incumbent\nAnd ... is running as a socialist that there were lots of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rubbed together in the Republican Party about while we can really use is because\nThe effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being pulled to the left to the left to the left and you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are interested in perhaps running for president or in these house races\nThat fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's this tension and it's almost as though they're seen as in parallel but sense of kind of different to me about tension about whether to be pulled the left\nA among Democrats a an you've seen that play on some congressional primaries and races and also tension about how strongly teach you fight for a you know political success\nOr earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later\nThey you know we don't do anything inappropriate you don't do anything illegal\nBut we're going to be tough and we don't fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king when the young [noise] you know almost all gave to us that can be taken away\nThat they love to do\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams a ... in Georgia a lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose he uh they said you know this is wildly inappropriate for the class\nOutrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president or took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the the the little the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones in a an incite violence uh and it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on in the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president to turn out in in high numbers and the Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they are part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line tacked tactics like\nHolding open the Supreme Court seat for a year and they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat for our policies\nAnd there's a debate between that and and the idea that we need more civility in our politics we're going to beat them by going high when they go low and that internal debate is still playing out and it's been happening in different ways in different parts of the country who seemed more moderate Democrats win in some places we've seen\nDemocratic socialism progressive when and other places and uh what's gonna happen in November is going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward in twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan steeply gotcha what's on your mind\nHi I Am calling that with the question what a counter general observation and that is\nI heard

new fall collection is on view and\nCharles River apparel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point on David Folkenflik we're talking about voter rights and the challenges devoting in the United states\nYou can join the conversation have you ever been knocked off the rolls how come we're one eight hundred for two three to five five ... hundred forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio my guest this hour Wendy wise or of the Brennan Center for justice at\nNYU and Dale ... of the ACLU\nOr you know the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia Stacey Abrams has spent her her years of late as an activist registering residents devote her opponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state and I think it was a really unusual consequence of careers focused on the issue of voting rate at the ballot box right\nStacey Adams appear Abrams excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday to discuss the tens of thousands of voter registration applications currently on hold it in the state of Georgia she was accused her home in blind camp of repressing citizens right to vote\nThe challenge is this process called exact match and we've been fighting on the sets twenty fourteen what happens is if you have a hyphen in your last name if he had a difficult spelling if anyone misspelled or lose leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically as a reason\nTo not process your registration and that means that of that fifty three thousand Georgia is currently have their registrations and pending status\nTechnically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not processed and so we're deeply worried at fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election [noise]\nA deal hotel me uh what what Brian Kemp said if he were here and uh how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to\nI'm Brian Kaplan I guess when he would say is we need to make sure that the people who are registering or actually the people who they claimed to be and therefore we need to impose strict standards on whether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor typo like a missing Heisman or the transmission of two letters on a someone's entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing to underscore I think is um the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote\nIn November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that's not a perfect solution because provisional ballots are counted under different rules um been regular ballots but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged\nA I'd like to take a call now from away cross Georgia a John go ahead you're on the air\nYes I was calling I'm about the uh the um now when you file your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license information in to get your tax return process including earned income credit\nAnd other credits that the people that you are saying are being disenfranchised um how's that because they want to get those refunds so so I don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThink you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nI accurate taking my call your CERN\nWhat bothers me is and it's rarely discussed is the fact that every one of these voter ID laws is always tied to furious restrictions to access to the polls\nEither reducing the polling places polling time um when they're clerks offices are open to file absentee ballots which was the case here in ... in Wisconsin [noise]\nSo it's not just about ... it seems to me that undermines his argument it's about voter fraud it's about reducing people's rights to vote\nFor thank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state\nUh for the state of Alabama since taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters had been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcomed on point\nMay be great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYes sir tell me just from the ... what's your approach to uh to to having voters on the rules\nWell David we will each and every eligible US citizen is a resident of Alabama to be registered to vote and have a photo lab date\nAnd we have gone to extra links to make sure that people are ... whenever that occurs and we visited all six seven counties at least one time every year with our mobile units as well as\nHaving our border registrars office opened each and every day that the court houses open and all six to seven county\nAnd we visit festivals events and activities in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one now I Will also tell you\nThat in the rare instances where people say hey I Can't get to the board registrars office because of my work schedule or I Can't get to one of the mobile unit location because it's not convenient or I don't go to the events are festivals in those rare occasions where that has happened do but we're going to people's homes\nAnd we have given them photo lab they and their homes and we're very excited\nLast three years nine months and twenty three days that I've had the privilege to be Alabama sick to state\nWe've ridge one million Ninety five thousand eight hundred and sixty one new voters and we now have three million four hundred and thirty four thousand eight hundred and sixty three registered voters in Alabama those numbers are unprecedented and unparalleled in the history of the state\nWhat's the need for the for the voter id\nWell the reason that I voted for David Was because I Want to make it easy to vote and hard to ...\nIf you need in a day when you open a bank account if you need in a day when you go to the movie\nIf you need an odd day when you buy six pack of beer or if you buy a pack of cigarettes then you ought to be able to present and not be when you exercise the most precious rat that we have to participate in our Democrat Republican is a vote\nI wanted to take a briefly a general I Want to take a call from a nearby states from Louisiana New Orleans I have Sharon on the line ... ... a share your thoughts on this\nAll right thank you for taking my call Manhattan in Louisiana you've had to show and I have an id

birth certificate Social Security card and to 'em for a friend and uh to document\nUm but they don't tell you you need that you know find out about the real ID until you go and get your driver's license training so if you're not in the schedule to get your driver's license renewed before next time your vote\nAnd you realize you need a ... and uh so I think Sharon\nSharon thank you so much for that I appreciate that John Merrill you're suckers date in Alabama ... some of the specifics and interest 'cause he's maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless number to David in his service\nTo remember that they vary from state to state we have\nTen different elements that can be chained to use when you go to vote including your driver's license or a non driver or the or the free Alabama voter id that we give any other valid state issue that the federal id\nA student at the passport a military ID A tribal Eddie oh we just want to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat period that's it and we bought David look we broken every record the history of the state\nFor voter registration and voter participation in our elections and ... were double excited about that because not a single time\nHas anyone been denied access to the polls because they didn't have the proper credentials when they went to vote not one time\nLet me ask you one question that some folks who analyzed or what efforts in your state and other states particularly in the south but not only just south of said uh they say two things one which they say that some of these rules even it framed for a new truly disproportionally affect voters of color citizens of color\nOr how do you respond to that ... those repercussions are those cravings\nThat they're entitled to their own opinion but to

even ... ... ... ... we are getting their ... members and not allowing military you can use ... than all fifty eight\nAnd he for heating that you're a huge gap in allowing and and now\nAlex thank you so much for sharing that perspective I really appreciate it one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about today's voter fraud in part because there's so little evidence that really happens I think that there was one survey done something like eight hundred million\nVotes cast over a fourteen year period and there were maybe scores of of of of allegations that seem credible maybe a hundred or two hundred a ... but that concern wall talked about a lot particularly twenty sixteen raised by the president and a lot of his supporters\nThere really isn't a lot of evidence to support that nonetheless such as we've all the testing there is a desire to ensure that people legitimately have the right to vote in these things when ... when the wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill he's ... state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well\nSo I wanted to build up with the last\nCaller talked about the difficulty of at least many Americans to register to vote and um the secretary marrow was very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree\nThat it should be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls and with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... a modernized the system so it's not just relying on\nAds in papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices but we're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem I'm Thirteen states and D.C have already adopted that in the last three years alone and there's been a really bipartisan support in momentum and it really works to expand voter registration and to do so in a much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary Merrill\nAbout um whether he is I'm interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWill windy or like you know without me but I Will see any way\nThat we have the nation in the last three years and much and twenty three days\nAnd voter registration per capita nobody won more than we've done\nNobody but we we don't get when football I think you can also like it's you can do when it comes to automatic voter registration which are which are talking about there's a different definition for what automatic voter registration means to you\nKnow one of the questions that outrage whenever somebody energy concept to me that you believe that if you have automatic registration in your state but there should be an opt out provision\nAn opt out provision would mean somebody says no I Do want to be registered\nTo keep from being registered when they engage in that activity will be getting your driver's license getting social services or whether it happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I immediately tell them that's what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we've had Ninety three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very very excited about that\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's\nEver been in a system where you have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and that the yield very very different levels of participation in the abstract you might think that those things\nAren't very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of opt in system through the DMV right now\nOther states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates\nSky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that\nIs to create an opt out says so we're getting callers are suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid thank you take one call Wendy deals secretary morals consumer of ... what would you think of potentially a creating a holiday whether it be a state holiday or even a proposed that perhaps the national level to\nUm have an official day off for voting whether or not they'd be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually votes\nOr I'll take the response off the air thank you thanks very secretary\nBarry I think it's important to know that it's\nBeen my observation in my experience people vote when it's important to and if you say well if we had voting on Saturday\nOf what had voting on a day that was specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase the turnout well when we broken every record the history of the state in the last three major election we had the empirical data\nAs they all said speaks for itself which is that people come when they want to vote\nWe had secretary ... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously the rig nipping at turnout is actually Yes sir I'm Sorry state Folkenflik\nOr ... you know there's obviously really interest to win one more and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama race right after ... and people really turned up uh what would make you think that people\nAre ... wouldn't turned out more if they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that uh that takes pulled me into it\nBecause this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing to point one million Alabamians go oh Seventy two percent of people that were registered voted\nIt sound like a guy you sound like a guy to me who's very much in quest of a hundred percent participation of people can do it right where a lot like there's something like that you desire to\nBut that's what I said earlier we won't each and every eligible US citizen as a resident of Alabama to be registered to vote and to be able to participate and have a voter ID card and to be able to participate at the level they want to participate\nBut I don't know why some people vote and some people don't if I knew that I'd write a book salad and I wouldn't be sectors date anymore I'd be a multimillionaire\nAnd I promise you that when you write that book well lucky among them point we'll have you on the second hour on friday and we'll enjoy yourself very much I'd like a ... to to to weigh in here I just wanted I secretary Merrill's observation about when people", "year": "2018",
