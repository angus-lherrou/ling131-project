I'm Sorry to jump in here but but are you telling me that like you you're out trying to turn it turned out the vote for the midterms\nYou got\nOh what courage ever did care whether Republican a damning independent get\nOut and get into the neighborhoods neighborhoods where people are really suffering and and you know come on Republican dense need to get down into these neighborhoods and see what's going on for these people who can't access jobs who who are living in ... in shambles right go\nPrior Kathleen I'm going to I'm so sorry to interrupt him and take it back from you there because I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guest here\nA polar read you're hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of whom saying he's gonna he's going to vote Republican almost entirely across the ballot for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen there in Ohio things she's going to try and turn out democratic votes so I mean how much\nCan we tell how much has this fight over justice Kevin are really further energized I'm\nA voter's going into the midterms\nWell it certainly energized voters go into the midterms to question is whether or not the GOP can sustain this\nOver the next month because well I said look the cabinet confirmation process did not go how the White House had hoped but the one side for them is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm election the poll showed that it was helping them sort of closes enthusiasm gap there were having trouble closing\nOn their own modality has been confirmed now that they sort of solidified have solidified on his conservative majority on the Supreme Court the question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president I'm Kansas over the weekend I can hear him say this again him and his allies\nTrying to sort of famous as it's all Democrats trying to obstruct their agenda were then for the Trump\nUm that the Trump victory in a presidential campaign to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November now there's no question that that folks on the other side dental kinds of progress as that they are certainly mobilized and this has been a catalyst for many of them to vote aren't cart others to vote\nBut again the big challenge for the president is allies can you sustain this yet another month\nNow Dick Pullman a here in Pennsylvania we've got a brand new district map congressional district map and so there we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't a thrown out in the last cycle here so\nHow much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh affect what's going to happen here no\nWell I think [noise] you know the Kevin things really in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly than the old when this when the new districts were by court ah and um they're much more sort of a\n... they're much more of a sort of appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican voters in the old district um and the but the Kavanaugh\nThing the ... just sort of be a cap or on a lot of the energy that has driven a lot of suburban white women suburban white educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we'd be talking about a blue wave for months uh I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports now increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is it all depends how to do something\nIs going to land just proportionally indifferent players so a lot of these house districts were which were are strong suburban districts like a lot of the ones around Philadelphia\nA are um are being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of the Republican over a lot of things that are being nearly the latest\nSo you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me the Democrats won't win the house and we need a net gain of twenty three they're probably going to pick up five or so in Pennsylvania alone there's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide that are that Republicans have that Hillary Clinton won the presidential vote in in twenty sixteen\nOn Tuesday I was going to it's going to fall different different places the red state Senate the red state Senate seats the Democrats have now that's where I can see a lot more Republican enthusiasm may be making a difference in from\nThe north Dakota and Heidi Heitkamp\nWas Andrea Hsu she might she might be told McConnell Mitch McConnell may be right when he says this is going to energize Republicans to keep the Senate the house I'm not sure well\nSo he'll couple or I'm going to come to you here in a second but uh since Dick Pullman mentioned the Senate and we had that caller Kathleen from Ohio expressing her just tastes for Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her vote to confirm justice Kevin uh we have a uh some tape here from Senator college she spoke with Scott Kelly on CBS is sixty minutes last night\nAnd said she felt very comfortable with her says her decision to support cabinet despite the testimony given by professor Christine Blasey Ford\nShe was clearly terrified traumatized and I believed that a sexual assault had happened to her what\nI think she's mistaken about is who was the perpetrator flats I Do not believe her assailant was Brett Kavanaugh\nNow so he'll ... senator Collins also spoke extensively on the floor of the Senate explaining why she was going to cast that affirmative vote for Kavanaugh and then we have\nThis strange happening on Twitter where Susan Rice apparently hints that she might do proto into a race against Susan Collins wouldn't hold up for reelection in a couple of years I mean what's going on their\nVote Susan Collins was obviously one of the pivotal swing votes it's arguable that if she voted the other way than Joe Manchin the Democratic came out almost within moments of her announcing her vote or would have gone the other way and the cabinet nomination would have would have sunk\nYou're listening to

member station W H y y in Philadelphia and we are joined today by Dick Pullman he's national political reporter and writer of the national interest blog\nAt WHYY polar read is also with us She's CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs and so I have a poor joins us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg\nPolitics and so you don't want her to turn something to you here because we heard Paul uh especially talking about before the break that the president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice Kavanaugh has kind of around a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other big issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily health care is has that whole sort of been temporarily set aside or do you think that that will will come back to voters and and candidates are going to come back to focus on these persistent\nIssues or the the the the country is still grappling with\nYes health care certainly has not subsided now whatever happens in Washington you know what whatever kind of a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle is happening healthcare has remained\nIn more ... than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election it's deeply personal to them and I think the uh the efforts to the repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act inflamed that debate\nA and kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here is that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals in that as\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and the last we've seen in the president's approval is\nSomewhere hovering around forty percent uh it's historically not good usually uh the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're ... at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but Democrats have in more and more polls and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans and the Senate he is very he's in a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidate or trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered Donald Rumsfeld it breaks down differently in different places that Republicans have kind of a dream of a Senate map where you know twelve out of the Thirteen most competitive races are in states that President Trump won and about half of them by massive margins\nWell I mean as you mentioned and Dick actually mentioned before the break that mid term generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you know could make it a tough a tough challenge for Republicans a this coming November but on the other\nOver the cabinet or a confirmation and nomination we are hearing Republican leaders talking about a re energized the base I mean Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on CBS his face the nation just yesterday saying that democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation had actually reinvigorated Republican voters\nIronically the behavior of the first to Democrats all the sudden Judiciary Committee and then\nThe overreach of the protesters at the Capitol is actually energize the Republican base a particularly the red states where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to thank I Want to thank the other side for the tactics that have allowed us to kind of energize and get involved all of voters\nDick Pullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings or or the low approval ratings that we have the\nPresident while you may be on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know\nHe's doing that in part because uh I don't know much else they they really have I mean you know we just talked to a few minutes ago about you know their past tax reform but if you look at how tax reform as polling most Americans don't think it's really making much of a of a bite of not by much of a boost to their income so that really hasn't been playing very well\nOr they did promise to a ... a abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact where Democrats used to run away from Obamacare as a campaign issue\nThis year particularly on the house side they're bracing it and it's not just I Know what you see it around here in Pennsylvania but over just across the river here in South New Jersey\nA there's a long time Republican congressional seat\nThat is a very uh it may took to the Democrats this time because the Democratic candidate by the name of Andy Kim\nA is every day he's stressing healthcare\nA and they don't talk about you know they're not talking ... aren't really talking that much about having a much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of\nFundamental kitchen table stuff\nUh that um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any a protest but potentially temporary spikes\nIn Republican enthusiasm so I think when McConnell is doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they said enough and they stuck it up enough you know the hope and the belief becomes reality but I think they have a a a way to go on closing the gap\nWill polar read I'm going to go to a couple of callers here but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at this um you know she was like like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in ah Pennsylvania New seventh district or just this weekend and a lot of talk\nAbout health care and actually relatively less about Kavanaugh himself all the women across the board\nWere very energized I think that's right yeah Kavanaugh certainly something that's that's trying to fix that here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership there was interest but I don't know\nNecessarily how much oil guy feel the polls even President Trump's election edited come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammer the president a harder on their part about health care act and they're a promise that need and and not kept yet\nYeah stick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they wanted to circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point\nThat you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made some long term changes like that can that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or they're you know the sale that's trying to do with voters here do you think they should know\nWell I yeah I think they should I think they should have I think they should have a long time ago I'm a ... you know maybe there's this whole notion\nUh the courts are ah are impartial and independent people and voters don't like to think of them as being part of the ... battlegrounds\nAh but the Republicans have successfully a campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight\nWas talking about the ah the war on the euro Warren Court and how the law you know we need more law and order\nCampaign against recording sixty eight successfully a and so for years Democrats of not they have not stress the court or a and I thought that they did what happened with the\nMerrick Garland in twenty six you know I think if you flip the parties around and and a Republican ... Republican president been in office and had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee\nAnd he didn't even get ahead you can get a hearing saying from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I said I don't understand why the ... so he'll go ahead\nSorry I I just wanted to add a it's a great point that Dick makes because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and then the Berger court through the seventies things like\nMiranda rights for criminal suspects brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court bang racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built\nA very very successful and very effective movement or you know with messaging with voter mobilization with millions and millions of dollars to a vet Supreme Court candidates were were solidly conservative you know who would vote with them and were to advance their goals\nThey did that as a ... you know and and they were able to do that partly as a result of a backlash to these liberal decisions at the Supreme Court made in that time a ... a question I have now is whether the left can ...\nUh you know can do a similar thing now in an era where the Supreme Court has made decisions like Bush Gore on Citizens United which you know the the pro or anti campaign finance regulation ruling\nA that paved the way for a lot of dark money in politics to the Supreme Court decision to cut the voting rights act an addict mentioned the\nBlockade of a President Obama Supreme Court vacancy with Merrick Garland by Republican leaders in the Senate\nKent liberal use that to motivate their base to care about the Supreme Court because right now the ... the conservative a movement the conservative base has a massive advantage on this issue\nWill get a couple more calls here before we switch gears to let's go to Amanda calling from Charleston South Carolina Amanda you're on the air\nMore information at WNPR dot org slash events [noise]\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I mean why did they do that has to be configured in other words no matter how strange the shape the district has to be a single unit that has been a long standing ruin Pennsylvania says fair districts ... who's also with us\n... both emphasize that gerrymandering has been a practice but loved by both parties\nBut the huge difference now the availability of voter records and a vast amount of consumer information ... says the combination of big data and sophisticated mapping technology allows district lines to things ... from house to house making certain seats so safe the opposition simply\nFalls away just the southern point five percent\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

talking about gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is\nAdventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation here in the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm joined here today by Lindsey lives our species a multimedia journals for WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords and media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because\nUh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court ah and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino to Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and\nYou know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a movie he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen ruin a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he\nFollowed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere's nothing in Pennsylvania Constitution which says ... it'd be fair whatever fair me that he just took it upon themselves to say fairness I mean you know what we think it means and they drew in the process what was one analyst called the Democrats dream map so it was a it was just such a [noise] you just said take and unconscious\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives are ski let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when did Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out\nYes and so the timelines here was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of their right to free an equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislature said OK guys you know give us your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we solve these um these contingencies of different groups Hannigan map and just those Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now and they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes the governor was supposed to approve 'em the matter that the legislature um came up with it didn't happen it didn't have\nThe first of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders do that was never pass by the general assembly in a form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court and in all fairness to both sides of the Supreme Court did not give the legislature I think adequate time to come up with a ... from the legislature could've come up with a map when when I met and they went back to\nThere's a clause in the constitution known as free in equal yeah which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suggesting\nThat they went back into a the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find it\nThere yeah there are so let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because\nThey saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but but Terry's indicating here that but this was a a novel reading one of the nation well I think you also have\nTo look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making the decision\nThat's exactly right I mean they've ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and I'm going into the federal court it could have going on and on and on for a relatively long period of time has it worked its way up through the through the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge off of you know different theory in the federal courts that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nOkay so there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican a to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now\nOn that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats you know need to pick up some twenty something seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nNow that the reason why I wanted to come here 'cause I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics on whether you know gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduced\nModerate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend\nTo to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper polarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and and here's what some voters in the ... valley told us about what they see\nFor the church and uh there's pumpkin\nPie pastry and pulled pork on the table at the Chapman quarries United Methodist church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidate Marty no Stein a bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled walls reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the ruins a volunteer has set up a life sized cut out if President Trump\nGiving a thumbs up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign of a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals the Lehigh Valley was previously split into a wrong lobster shaped district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nIs old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight points Rogers says the newly drawn to restrict favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nI like to think of the valley is a microcosm of the United states blue dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we've excited about Rogers\nCalls no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate wanna cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics\nNo Stein also advocates for strict term limits but he falls in line with the ... on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNo Stein is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and greet\nHe's not a pie in the sky conservative there's people who are just the idea logs and he is not an ideologue he is a working\nMan so I ask Nicholas a question does she think political compromise may be possible in her new balance district\nYou will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the global is\nNicholas says there's another divide she thinks Democrats are encouraging a sense of victimization and women other women at the table not in agreement\nFor Dr Ford I think she was victimized but she came across\nFor me that would not have been our response\nNot by any means we refuse to be victims we we would have been angry and yet\nWhen he closed does not approve of the fact that millions of women and men are angry right now and they're taking action\nThey're marching in the streets and protesting on Capitol Hill but to Nicholas that kind of anger isn't becoming it's not viable she says Ryan Rogers Marty no signs campaign staffer puts it this way\nYou're listening

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call [noise] um I I'm from uh eleven district in Pennsylvania just king is running [noise]\nAnd I also helped I also did some volunteer work or George Scott in the ... district\nAnd I was\nHappy to see these two districts are now competitive especially\n[noise] but um I'd really like to see Pennsylvania move further and his direction and make it more fair mhm\nAnd I really wonder why should this be more of a mathematical\nLaw procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to topple after the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population of the counties and founder either\nRight it's a good question Jason and I mean we lose our team and following this issue for a long time what do you think yeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling on you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know a congressional districts need to be ... compact they need to be contiguous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that you know I'm\nGoing forward or the ruling does say that there are these neutral criteria that need to be considered before part is in concern but you know the quick can goes so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes too partisan so there's it's a day but there there are some guidelines that you know or the legislature can use going forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the\nPoint that the caller was making about you know are there algorithm make ways to get fairness out of out of district ... our politics always going to be part of this process\nOh I don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both tried to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better a jury during because of the nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level\nYou want to just said not the district or the ward level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nOther side wants to listen to the rules for the algorithm [laughter] when I was thinking we think computers can do a better let's take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call I live in northern Sonoma County that's Akron, Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican governor and a Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over and took over the northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressmen were were they see and it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our Democratic Congress\n... you may I made a thanks go ahead whom and\nHow to make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats or put it another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats\nBut that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has done by law\nBut when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state that has a huge difference on writing the laws of each day you know that govern\nProcess itself so the two thousand and ten election was huge not just in terms of the bringing the Tea Party to power the radiological conservatism represents\nGo head was yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the laws they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined Democrats ... ... it's being nonpartisan ... you're not ... and but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district of Maryland yeah so this is not partners in both parties will do that\nWell that's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it on the other they have done here in Pennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere people keep talking to me about Marilyn\nA California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to limit let me play for you\nI'm a a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's the GOP chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just takes he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um and he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second he poses other systems to drop future congressional map and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best position to draw a line than they are today heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation that draws part of the political map done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps of their favors and other states like Maryland so\nYou know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder fair disturbing plan they call that to take back the rational seats and they've done it here in Pennsylvania [noise]\nThat's about the Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair citizens' lives are so he he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps but there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania\nI just have to say I love that um operatic music behind fail in Columbus Day festival in Philadelphia is taking me there to shout Philly um so\nYou know a a group a in Pennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement and independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they've modeled this after California\nAnd um this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs you see them at events canvassing and you know ah they they they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interests to form this\nCommission as you pointed out it there is a such a commission in California made up of a appointed independent citizens and I think some several others a couple of other states in the west have similar similar commission so who do they have they created fair districts\nUm if you talk to the the people on the commission yes if you talk to voters yes I think a key difference between Pennsylvania in California is that in Pennsylvania\nUm there's no referendum so basically um to get that process in place at the state legislature would have to pass a constitution\nFriend and then there is no guarantee there's no guarantee that an independent commission itself would be truly independent I mean there's I mean by somebody yeah they are that that that's", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
