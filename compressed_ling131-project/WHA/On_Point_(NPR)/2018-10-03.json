U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas\nBrandon running housed joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston joining us from Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel I feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between\nCrews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOh what does the Texas race mean to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nActually Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth in the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between ah since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc ... not monolithic\nAs Brennan was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and Latinos are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who said that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group a\nLatino voters is that they haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore it costs a lot of money and Texas\nAnd progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is\nThis could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party I'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work\nThan has yet you've gotten I see\nA brand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent yeah they're they're low uh\nIt's got more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nTed Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of more continuous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump but there's a lot of friction so\nI see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here as potentially influential in this race I mean ... white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election naturally gonna what's probably drive any kind of success that Iraq fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challengers the congressional level many of whom have\nA really harness this vote and could potentially do well but I also think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks ... considerably in favor of Beto O'Rourke they don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for\nPeople who are over forty but it is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual growth of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being a out of luck poor partner places like Ford been county here outside of Harris County\nOutside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another level of success the Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in in this race in November\nWell it's always the wild card in elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always sad bakeries and that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it because it's a non voting stay\nSo if you get all these populations who don't usually vote that could change what Texas looks like if you change the electorate you can change who gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term\nI mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and\nAnd angry and you know all that they typically like Democrats aren't likely to vote during that time so if if that's a different this year like this could look different than most mid term now so I'm seeing\nFor example ... wrote to 'em a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever showing up and listen to you talking to to to voters\nOr or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so is he hoping\nTo draw out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the taxes that we've seen in other places we saw that\nIn New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nIt's betting on yeah go ahead written in ...\nOh sorry I was going to say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout is in ... in mid term years you're talking about\nProbably on the order of about thirty percent which is extremely low now I think will have a turnout probably spike a little bit in this election because you definitely have the energy that we've\nSeen 'em and so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you still have about two and a half million unregistered Texans who could otherwise register\nThe Latino population is only registered to vote at about thirty forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there's still some fundamental voting demographics and make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide\nWell I Want to listen to a little\nShould know that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and two ... and better routes campaign as well invited them or or one of the represent their representatives to join us today a Iraq's campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our class but we do our due diligence on that part\nBut let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his\nContentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president on substance and we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax cut of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations we're seeing record low unemployment\nTexans lives are better so yeah I could have chosen\nTo make it about myself to be selfish and say you know what my feelings are hurt so I'm going to take my marbles and go home but I think that would have been not doing the job I was elected to\nThat Senator Ted Cruz on September twenty second let's take a call here Dan is calling from San Antonio you're on the air Dan\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em I Want to say that\nThere's a lot of world and I know don't have all that much time but I did want to say that that will work gives me and my family's in ... that we haven't felt love generation um my parents would say like John F. Kennedy or the Kennedy family inspiring us to to have some hope\nBecause living in this so called red state lakes us cringe every time I hear that because we were starch blue family and everyone I Know just about is a at least inside their county here in San Antonio I'm however we are very diverse state and it's all good and I like the message that this war is about\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

the we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez Brandon rotting house and Abby Livingston\nAs well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to you and and watching on their televisions\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\nWe were able to\nYou know the last\nWashington actually run churches mountains\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto O'Rourke campaign and here's some sound from an ad that ripped the Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running\n\nAn ad there from Senator Ted Cruz brand of running house that that Ted Cruz add ... ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership but the idea that\nUm ah that you maybe liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah I thought you're going to say that this was something that holds the Texas hold dear because it's like country music but I think that's true as well\nThere's definitely a a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign to understand how to run in taxes they know that there's a certain like guys as you say for voting um to keep me to people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely enough\nRepublican support in a midterm election that an organic\nKind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work\nOr walk past a tangibly make up about a million votes and the just assure as God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in mid term so the difficulty of trying to make up that with a campaign like Cruz's running which primes Republicans and primes conservatives it just makes it really difficult well\nLet's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air\nAnd learning I'm just calling and I made millennial voters and twenty sixteen election I hadn't voted for Donald Trump\nA conservative household my husband is conservative my whole family is but I've been very encouraged and I and voting for that to work that election in November just because he's looking beyond party can line and I think that's so important\nTo 'em in this day and age right like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that don't work is\nGoing out there and I'm making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing\nChristine touched a few quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year\nYes I did oh so what's changed their hand\nIn that um I really I whenever he was in the twenty sixth election\nAnd how just didn't like the talk that whenever he was talking to\n'em President Trump than just how like how he stood against them and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that\nYou're a true um I think it's important that person's true colors men how he just\nWas really a good President Trump and all of a sudden he for him like that to show you something about some of these personality how I really appreciate how that will work is just um he is he is\nOf course the owners that you can ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the campaign recently right to a controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or\nReview for a Broadway musical of where he is in the review he wrote some um unkind things about the female actresses in the Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seem to be their phenomenally large body parts and you say it does that concern you\n[noise] um I I don't know um [noise]\nI Know he's apologized for it ... and um I I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for some maybe it's all a diet but to still standing up for women's rights\nYeah ... I I just want to say I don't know it was a perfectly finance a rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so so thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be the Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare\nBut on the other hand I mean she talked to the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more\nPositive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things from ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In Texas that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women has been should stand up for his wife and so it's it's a tough conundrum he was and I do think if this is John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner\nIs very very polarizing and so I think she underscored that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave 'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came\nFrom a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military and are working to end up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful\nUm and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated friendly with people like me and the fish is a public trust and power who have been unable to resolve this or bring jobs just for what has been drawing and just all from January to happen in this country and violently peacefully\nWhile they argue this country or watching these games they take on me to bring attention to this problem to ensure that we fix that is why they were doing it and I can think of nothing more Americans\nActually Lopez ah as I mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas\nWell I mean if you look at the black vote in Texas I Would say it went over really well specifically among black voters yeah something like Ninety seven percent approval according to like one latest poll on that one might be a little high but it it's not unlike most polls that have come out\nUm you know conservatives this is red meat for them this is something that Ted Cruz had been talking about um the NFL or than that the protest during the national anthem he's been talking about his rallies\n'cause it really frustrates conservative or they see this as like disrespectful to the flag into veteran so you know if you look at like democratic base voters this is something that they are so excited to hear you know a Democrat\nI'm standing up for racial injustice in their eyes and then on the on the other side you know conservative voters you know this is a polarizing issue so conservative literacy this very differently and are very frustrated by this\nWNPR is proud to celebrate books and readers in Wisconsin find out more at Wisconsin book festival dot org [noise]\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

T. smart home investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history listened on apple pod cast [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker ... we're talking this hour about maybe rethinking how we approach issues of being overweight and obesity in America\nAnd we are joined today by Michael hubs he's a staff writer at Huffington Post and he's author of an article titled everything you know about obesity is wrong or there's a link to it at our website on point radio dot org\nDoctor if a team of ... Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us\nIn our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of go you gave us the top three bullet points of the\nUh aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect synonym but we oftentimes feel as if they are a with people who are struggling with their weight what do you mean\nOh well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago my call this is how I was like we hung out together because yeah I Know it was really fun ask 'em\nAnd I think I mean ... there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic the healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage\nOf fat people with metabolic be healthy obesity in some studies find a much larger percentage and I actually you know for team up feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter that we know how\nDifficult wages to lose and we know how harmful it is the shame people for their weight\nAnd so if there are big health effects of obesity I'm not sure the\nTell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important you know I mean I I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man\nTheir health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine from my doctor to talk to me about those things\nBut he needs to talk to me about those things in a healthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices what are your drug use practices and not in this way that hello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that\nI mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino was the way that you guys had an hour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them and that's something that with primary care providers a lot of ... never gets that luxury of somebody asking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them\nA lot of patients period will never get that luxury their primary care physicians doctors never go ahead yeah so am I Want to touch on a few points number one I Want to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I can tell you that patients on the extremes meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity\nI'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has either mild moderate to severe obesity I'm so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes week vice and stigma so I Want us to to make sure that we don't do that\nNow this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity\nIs such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define clearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology\nWhat we're finding is that this term metabolic ... healthy obesity as as a little bit falling out of favor because we're we're finding is that even in patients where things appeared normal on the surface\nThey do have issues so for example\nI have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients that obviously have moderate to severe obesity um and when you look at them they may have no obesity ... more but conditions at the time of surgery\nWhat we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and what's that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease\nNow if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound that their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have liver disease but when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence that we're sending to surgery actually have\nFatty liver disease Ninety five percent or Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this so that shows you that we're not picking up on something in a way that we might in an adult patients who question about this because I think you know there's something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing out like\nBut but why should a neurologist though be talking to someone about their weight when that person's there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said Dr Stanford because how\nAnd you're all just isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway lives but let's look at what you guys just said and this is going to put it on my medical ... because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity\nHave a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs they are ... that are used to treat migraine headaches also are great for weight loss\nSo when I find that my patients and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients have a history of migraine headaches and have obesity I might concurrently be treating with the medication both disease process is I'm getting rid of their migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation so I Would say that their neurons\nThe lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all organ systems soon ... is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that\n[noise] well I think I mean the stories that I'm hearing\nFrom fat people are not that they're neurologist or saying you know we have a couple of morbidity do you mind if we run some tests the stories that I'm hearing are we won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing for people that their doctors refuse to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors refused to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight\nI think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate\nWeight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor\nAnd I think that it's it's really worthwhile to separate those two things because not every fat person goes to the doctor seeking to lose weight a lot of them feel like their life is finally feel like their habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already on a plan by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight and some other way\nAll they need is a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get in a train accident\nThey need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix that ... D located shoulder\nAnd so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that\nFat people are not getting effective medical care and a lot of people just shows up in studies to that fat people avoid going to the doctor because they're afraid that they're going to get shame for their weight or they don't get cancer screenings because they're afraid of what the interaction with the nurse is going to be like they don't want to be weighed and I think if you're thinking about effective care\nI think it's fine for a neurologist to bring up hey you know based on the research we have a couple of things that are related weight might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not the kinds of interactions that people are having\nIt's really important to think about how pervasive white stigma is and how weight does this credit patience with their doctors oftentimes in specialties\nThat are really only tangentially related to weight ducts\nNever go ahead yeah so I Do agree that we as physicians overall don't do a great job of approaching patients that struggle with their weight secondary to our own biases\nAnd an adequate education surrounding how to treat patients that have obesity on what we do know when you do cover this in your article is that um education surrounding obesity nutrition physical activity\nAnd medical schools residency programs throughout the country is minimal at best\nUm I can tell you that there are several organizations working on improving the standards um surrounding this issue because we do know that forty percent of the adult population has obesity and Nineteen percent of the pediatric patients ... which means that this is by far the most prevalent chronic disease and so I agree that we do have some work\nUm I Would say that if patients are concerned about the care they're getting and if they want and dedicated care I Would seek out on a fellowship trained obesity medicine physician like myself are one that has\nUndergone I'm training and or certification by the American board of obesity medicine\nAnd I just I've been here for that because if you're living in Boston or Seattle or Chicago or Houston maybe you can find that ... what if what if you're living in a rural county that doesn't have the time\nThat we're doing a really good job so the American board of obesity medicine has certified twelve hundred physicians and obesity and different sub specialties from neurology to OBGYN to pathology in recent years and what you can do is you can go to the American board of obesity medicine site\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I'm Sorry Michel hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr Stephanie solved\nFrom them teach wheat center was interviewed and we do have all of our patients um spend time with the psychologist delving to issues such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life\nSo I Do think that that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like Dr song working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops did do a good job by bringing those voices into the artist so\nI wanted to switch you can switch gears here for a second um and and take a step back and Michael we'll bring you in back in here for this as well\nBecause I'm Dr Stanford I just I've heard you a couple of times in this conversation you know call ... ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight but\nFifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese American anywhere where near what we have now so I mean I don't I I don't think anyone's gonna say that\nThe this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and so and so so this is such a layperson question but I just want to get your field\nIs it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it kind of happened overnight\nAbsolutely I think this is I'm really we are in an OB so genetic environment so I call it the perfect storm what we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality and duration of are asleep\nWe've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances what I mean by that is that we are rewarded with being able to talk to our colleagues in Russia\nAnd talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states to\nTell you that maternity it's terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that ... not joking me right if you're talking about sleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who you are in lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive than the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega\n[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less exercise more\nThat assumes that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids and two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people\nYou know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids\nYou're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen and process to whatever else\nAnd that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have\nWe we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and\nThe choices that we make with in those options I don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them to do\nAnd so the reason why I wanted to bring this up Dr Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um\nEven in that context to this conversation it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know ... individual responsibility or things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to weigh outside of that\nWe have to go outside the box we need to bring together persons and healthcare persons and that our policy makers\nUm physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about\nBringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a in a direction where we actually had any dead on obesity rates in both the pediatric an adult population and and I think what we've done um with regards to this epidemic his work\nEntirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and\nOh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world well\nLet's get another call in here arenas calling from Providence Rhode Island Reno you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I Am a primary care doctor in Johnston Rhode Island just outside of Providence and um\nIt's a wonderful conversation I'm outside of my office just nodding my head very enthusiastically about all the comments that people are making\n'em and I had read Michael's article and sent it actually got out the other providers and the office because I think it's such an them or in concept of how we speak to our patients about this and I just wanted to comment on the\nUm the nuances of how you speak to people about this conversation but", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "03"}
