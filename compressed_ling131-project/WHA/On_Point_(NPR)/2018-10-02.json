reporter for slate and host of the economic as podcast as well\nAnd I want to just go through a kind of a little walk through a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where\nPolitics definitely came into play a first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here's then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October\nTwo days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation knots to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a Robert Bork ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of the politics involved in his nomination\nMost serious and ... and all of this is not for me nor is it to all of those who have stood vastly supported by nomination Andrew Marr I'm deeply grateful\nRather the damage to the ... and the integrity of law at a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings this\nIs a certain sort of national disgrace [noise]\nAnd from my standpoint [noise]\nAs a black American as far as I'm concerned it was a high tech lynching for up all the blacks who in any way Jane suffering for themselves to do for themselves to have different views\nIt as a message that unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen to\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't plenty tape there because he never even got a hearing so that takes us then to where we are now in two thousand Eighteen and just last week\nPres a Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole week effort as very calculated and orchestrated political fueled would apparent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo it with WIC hoping phone lines better have you with us now yeah I'm here great ... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing\nIs what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\nI you know I think it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry ah we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nTactically a mistake was he talked really in Folsom\nClear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very\nVery strange almost the mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with very very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of\nTheir actual ... views standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no use balls and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork with the last time we had anything close to a truthful\nScrutiny of someone's record now what we have is this funny pantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote in the past has any bearing and I think that sets up\nA what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very cold here very coherent\nThat channel record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now that doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money and the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that\nBut I think at least Bork was honest and he was when the Senate exercised it's advise and consent it did so knowing yeah that's gone\nWell Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that the naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process the proceeds any justices elevation to the high court\nIn medical yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork ... a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight to zero I think or maybe it was Ninety eight to two\nOh I think was zero I'm ... I don't understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them and almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was true\nAh everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can argue it's almost impossible to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe where the Democrats did was a Bork and and what may worker blurb\nWas they smeared him in every conceivable way except to sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know that this was how they thought they could win now which Thomas was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all of all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee\nA he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Sistine admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him I have it on good it's\nEvery one of those judges or or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe a marred him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleague\nWho uh you know who was much more conservative than most and some of them in some ways but it was an excellent tone yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person we saw on TV the other day was totally out of character for a cabin or in this process I think drove them after a\nWhile and and and a done deal this week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans\nIn those hearings themselves but also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants the nuclear option or ... the nuclear option button in two thousand Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees in two thousand Seventeen that removed you know what was the most effective\nBreak in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and its role here in creating this highly politicized environment for the court\nI don't think there's any question I think that the\nFact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality of this feat rests on one or two people's\nVotes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that you know justices Ginsburg and Justice Scalia\nOften uh say are set in ... case look this used to be a Ninety eight nothing seems to be a Ninety four nothing enterprise because of the rule that everybody at here too in the Senate was\nElections matter and if the president chooses someone who's fit we don't go after them because of perceived outcomes and that's clearly just gone\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity\nAnd the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by Dahlia Lithwick Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is for the last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything in this record\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place date and no cooperation and fast enough for you God help us all as Republicans go this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm\nYou better watch out for your nominee\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the recent quote hysteria is because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American Life now\nOur political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues to introduce legislation that ends lifetime tenure for the judiciary\nBecause if they're just politicians than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat's Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break ahead to interrupt you there so that we could take a break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics and the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court and doing its actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator fast put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think you know the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception\nOf the justice is but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation that justice is own view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas never fully recovered from\nWhat he thinks we've done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten how his hearing joint\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh's elevated to the court he will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justice is\nA perception that the public and that's something that I think we really do you have to factor in conversation\nI'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks have been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just wanted to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justice his own voting are just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps uh I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we have justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived\nA preferred vote of the president that in that nominated then I put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true but it's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs a nominee for the Supreme Court politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense also say\nIf you look at the American people's attitude toward the court\nMost people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics politics is in place some sort of role in the court\nAnd people often times do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so is that the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institutions automatically its legitimacy is loss and no longer people are going to follow it dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get this is from almost be through it first of all um the the point of course is the legitimacy and integrity or public trust but a lot of\nThe perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a adjusted to report replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public side and now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propagandize uh easily manipulated a populist in modern history and so through the media and through a lot of other things they are a\nGiven a perception of what is and what is not but to the last several months Donald Trump and his\nA blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with the ... don't don't we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law\nI think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limits on terms now because this is simply a political position\nWell Aaron thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor hum at least one you know one thought there about from the from a member of the public about maybe time for term limits with justice is\nWell I think term limits as a wonderful idea I've slept that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen\nBecause it would require is maybe a constitutional right even getting it through Congress or the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be heard who's ... who's people or older you know who's terms or later\nAnd they're always be a calculation where if one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing and neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years\nUm but that's what's going on I think that's what we're going to be seen from ... for a long time well let's go to\nTroy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air dry\nOh thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported Kagan\nFor Obama and the uh keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court goal is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that what he's going through [noise] thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the air Joe\nI'm I guess what I figured that law called the ... through them if the if the Supreme Court and the question was going up or go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justices whether or not I got the right to marry I or go\nOn and now I'm kind of thing that play out of the gang where there's a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more playing down to\nUm that was the right has actually just a code word for religious\nSo it's a bunch of religious people on the right who want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard\nThey still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything to be able to give me get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there was no scientific reason you are prohibited gay people are married it's just about what religious doctrine is actually going to sway the massive\nYeah well Jill thank you for your call a deli it looks like you have a response to that [noise]\nYeah I mean I think Joe just gave us the answer to Stuart subject Gina Stewart correctly makes the point that the Supreme Court has inserted itself into all the big ticket issues of the day [noise]\nExcuse me and I think you know what you just heard was the Supreme Court was by

break a fuse me before the break a bear people tell me to talk too fast so maybe I should slow down here I'm a you were telling us you've got a couple of friends there in the studio that was a little unexpected to me because we didn't know a ... you'd have anyone else on your end in London but you know what even inspired me about\nA this is talk about the survivors mindset and getting outside your comfort zone so we're going to get outside of our little radio comfort zone here for a minute good few if we can you reintroduce as to who your friends are and he said they have an incredible ... survival story [noise]\nWell what I was saying is that survival is this is so much about the spirit you know and the rest of it as the arena that we ended up playing and whether you're stuck in the life rough to do in a plane crash or whether you're dealing with bereavement illness or whatever it is all about having not survive the spirit\nAnd you know it's it's a it's great I Love being you

a bit nervous or that or it's all in an unexpected\nBent bend house quite but asked my um\nHe he can be cost hospitalized for about four days off time I'm being unable to raise 'em\nSo he's on a regular ... medication for that but he he wants to get better on the fight sent so he's he's tried boxing but most recently um\nBest program on this new book especially ... so he loves going climbing into mountain since he's always pushing himself\nA ... every time we go um he he uses an inhaler low but he's really looking back on using the inhaler now so he's really pushing themselves getting higher up the mountains like literally and\nYou know using the inhaler last see he's he's really pushing him say option is better than no\nWell that sounds great and and and Ben let me just turn back to you really quickly so uh what is what is it about about Barron what he's done and his book that inspires you to to push yourself why why do you want to do that um it's\nVery inspirational because them all the things in that light cannot will still for everything I can remember\nFind savings shift inspirational\nOkay well so let's see how far the inspiration goes 'cause I Want to play a clip here from two thousand seven to ... from an episode of Baird real man versus wild and he was dropped into the rugged terrain of Western Australia and he ran out of water and here's what happened next\nTime they drink my I pay a song I've never done before [noise] and I'm going to be pretty horrible but I Need to keep going and [noise] may seem disgusting but your own urine is safe to drink [noise]\nFair grills a re hydrate ing in Western Australia in two thousand seven uh then I'm going to argue and I\nForget that [laughter] I'm gonna let you off the first time I go entirely that bend you're lucky what do you drink you know you're lucky if I got about a novel Jewish and bad I Will do stand\nWould you go so far as to treat your urine you had to stuck on a mountain [laughter]\nDepends [laughter] probably yeah [laughter] well Ben Simon thank you for big our surprise guest this hour or ... let me let me turn back to you or was it disgusting it sounds like it was\nA lot of things and survival of disgusting you know but I've learned you lead the prejudices behind you go to do whatever it takes and survival food is never going to taste Niceville look nice and survival\nYou know like fluid Seventy Tice nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and I'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for fun\nKnow them over the years and that kind of make a swift exit if I get Qunu by somebody tells me they do it for fun at home you know what I'm\nDoing in your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still\nThat if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia being dig a hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it\nAnd the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole actually condense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cop and you say there you see here if you're an eight and the whole before setting up the still\nMoisture New Years will condense into clean drinking water why didn't you knew that\nThat you could the thing is if you're really de hydrated drinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you just send a pure waste product\nSo if you can make a cell is still like this you have the you have the resources to do that\nPaying into the bit around that you're gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're gonna get fluids out of that but if you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in survival situation for example your car breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrated you don't want to be paying out those fluids because she if you'll pay is clear\nThat that can actually help high drag you so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways may be paying onto your clothes and wrapped around her head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know and he he's a little things about the bunch of times I mean it was right if you love looking back into it because what if it was a crew to guide ... thing than a hundred days we'll move ... wrapped around my neck you know on the head scarf the pay and [noise] you know but he said let's see if it's about what ever tell you who's in it since you mentioned your crew I've\nAlways wondered I mean how ... your crew was there with you with their equipment having to go through the same terrain and as you are I mean how how how much do you ask of them in terms of uh of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing\nI'll tell you while they are they're incredible they really are they're being with me from day one is a small team\nYou know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thing can hype about them is true you know they always say hey ... you have the easy job we're going to do everything you do the backwoods carrying a camera you know and it's a bit you know\nBe under no illusion they are incredible and they work the hardest and the the real unsung heroes and the whole story\nAll right well we're speaking with their grills he is host of running wild with their grills and of course man versus wild he's got a new book out called\nHow to

bar the we're talking this hour with Baird grills you've got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation and beer before the break we heard from college Steve who was former a navy special forces are here in the U.S and he had gone through the the Navy's really rigorous ear training\nA and he was talking about how um as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've\nEver experienced a similar challenge or had gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and uh I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now [noise] yeah\nNo festivals the respect fuel service in a ... to be\nA guy Iranian before you're ... you're so right the the the battle for survival is won or lost in the mind\nUm the sea of training is something I went through likewise with part of the British special forces or it is long it is oh you should it's tough and the time on the road I I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's\nOh ... okay we're in today is you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks and I she found ... you get so busy surviving uses job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy days as a lone survivor to look out for yourself and again you know women now as a crew you know when were filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands if you need it you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed to put a first on that well you do you know the ...\nThe everything on your own to send my child that but it's all so busy you know I just remember that save training I went through to the days on our own and it was just doing to the doctor and if you collected firewood repairing the settings as doing that\nAnd by the end in sight yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beef you gotta keep thinking like you know\nI always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind go into neutral is always something they're doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on your own I I think it's three times higher than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere just one of the thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from your cars and actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was ... he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I'm just wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on TV or on the survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly may ... spending three hours trying to lie to five ... often the reality of a sudden in the old days on the ... wild shows\nYou know I've spent hours an hour is doing this so you know hours and hours studying ... and all of a say that she was going to make a really boring program you know I guess edited down and before you know it's a bit of music and ... book has got a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said right at the start of the show survivor of summed up three was never give up or what about that to nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why\nThe rules where we've got to that don't get that determine you know nest Saturday to the Berlin the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick right here for by the way to wrap it for a few people\nThat's got to be no one do you love food team found in the ... yeah I I'm not saying that Seventy says we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave them nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFill my bringing themselves that you know we come back a month later in his ... showing that they like string white law said and that is the reality of survival is yet you're starving you ... your frighten you wet your cold and ... and\nYou know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous as very on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell speaking of the the glamorous part of survival and do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answer so they can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation survival situation how miserable is bears intestinal tract\nCould not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat your\nMind tests attract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] I mean there's definitely a talk about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff you know side um but on the whole is that you're not getting the land ... by the failures than you next time I go to ... to ... that want to get\nIt right so get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous planter animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super caffeine in the ... made big mistakes once and when it comes to you know poison things I've funky mushrooms and ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt don't eat it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like some neat things okay and then you know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one side great film you know the other end of the wiring the Alaska decided in the ... and I had a baby come on you I got her own rent and get it wrong one side of the\nYeah by the way if you have from folks haven't read it Jon Krakauer original book is amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\n[noise] well hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survive as enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress severely thinks she's going to snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survive is all about that in the spirit and all the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know such an inspirational survivalists so they all living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity [noise]\nUm and actually some of them have the guns the guy with the you know [laughter] or that if it was impressive to see as well\nAll right one more a lightning round here question Sam Winston on Twitter or sorry on our website says beer can you do your classic ... like when you accomplish a big Clyde\nThanks that's from Sam ...\nCome on give out team were on it we're moving on a ski guys stay positive protein in we can do this\nFair grills and his classic hell let's go to Mars Selena who's calling from Dayton, Ohio you're on the ...\nIt's MORNING thank you for taking my call my question for Barry is I I read somewhere if you live in the woods or is any part of a pine tree\nPine cone does drink the water from the early part but I Can't find the information to know what that is true or not\nIs true that the the pine tree is one of the unsung heroes of the wild and there's so much you can do everything you mentioned but also more you know the old days they used to use the reds and mix it with a charcoal from afar make glue outta that\nUh you know ... ... to ... uh there's so much to do I spend a lot of time is moving through forests just cheering on the\nChewing on the needles good victim and see you know I mean you think of all of the\nClassic old Raul navy and the old days sending around the world\nAnd ... things ... and everyone was dying lack of intimacy and yet they were harvesting pine trees whether we're going to replace them most in the ships but will they didn't realize that the ... the pine trees could give them a lot more than just good new mom so my ship it could give them a little bit of insane it wasn't a hundred years later they figure these things outside\nThe pine tree is one of the many heroes of the outdoors and also super easy to make fun with you get that ... ...\nCome to that and that's why you got to be so capital of sea with forest fires are highly flammable but uh uh one of the unsung heroes of the wild", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "02"}
