I really appreciate markets all do you draw the connection between the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nWell I'm feels gross to talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking and discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what\nJake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give 'em\nA really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and and and what is it are really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states a with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is the U.S getting played President Trump\nJared Kushner have put all of really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi basking in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran or who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nUh and uh it is this the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm\nTrying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the u._s. got involved in other people's business wealth or because to promote democratic ideals and to um\nTo try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also saved to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have order around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some\nSense of appropriate global behavior okay so uh why should every American care about that more than the economy or a more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that it will will impact them negatively\nMean ... how important we think this is geopolitical spaces journalistic basis a moral basis very few people are going to vote on a hundred percent ... but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted ... American reporter for the guardian\nAnd pleaded guilty to that I Believe misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that\nAre and what he's counting singer was seemingly kind of\nThe hands of a a an ally it from Saudi Arabia I'm not going to uh [noise]\nI'm just not in the position to make predictions about what the president's rhetoric the president's rhetoric in the United states\nOr it has caused this in any way our fuel in any way but I Will say that um when when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay American journalists are concerned uniformly not just about the implications that has in the United states but about the implications that has another country's\nUm I've won a plate in we should turn to the midterms is coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here that the the tenor of what he has said in trying to rally the Republican faithful and the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia and Mississippi just in the past few weeks\nI'm not on the [noise] but I Am I\nVote for me I Want you to send them on the balance it out\nIn twenty Eighteen because you are voting for me in twenty eight [noise]\nYou're voting for me but then again President Trump told the Associated Press and an extensive interview\nThis week he will uh be to blame if the Republicans were to lose the house in November Jack Beatty is Donald Trump on the ballot even if his name isn't there or is he not\nHe certainly is and he was right the first time I'm you know when you look at the election step back there really tool elections going on one is in red states the senators and one swing districts the house members in the Senate it looks like the chancellor Republican chances according to\nA five thirty eight are four and five of holding the Senate and maybe even gaining some seats are the Democrats only one in five on the other hand you look at the house five and six chance that the Democrats will take the house one in six for the for for the ... the Republicans holding on so\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio a couple of listeners weighing in on line\nI'm Roger hunter at least a but listen posting on the named Roger ... post ah\nAh that civility and the Democrats and the GOP is long gone the opposition is now the enemy hard to see during these a midterm election season what could bring us together or another one speaking about the question of what we are expecting President Trump to do a notes\nSays it's worth noting the President Carter's disastrous legacy including a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow the shot in Iran and its evolution to fifteenth century theocracy a as described\nThere a couple of listeners weighing and I wanted to turn to another element of the midterm elections which is the question of turn out in ... turned out to Latino voters Democrats talk about this a lot I think are in Texas they'd been staking that the idea that bait or a rock would somehow benefit from that his\nHe's fluent in Spanish appealing to Latino voters are are said to be even though a\nHis opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent ah Fernando ... how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that\nLatino turnout was very very lowest twenty seven percent and twenty sixteen went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nFew um has a pure research Hispanic trends came out this week with their with numbers on to you know a vote this year they they are saying that there's a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered\nUm it's it's been low a in talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas a back door probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if\nCrew says uh appeal to two Latino Republicans in Texas is is is strong enough um interesting play for instance Univision just a interviewed last week both candidates and\nAnd and ... did it as as oh she always does with Spanish language media didn't in Spanish or Ted Cruz didn't um\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout was going to be that traditionally it turns to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week would there a year I'm I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection and they'll let you know vote we might get a clearer picture than but but this again and we'll we'll dependable hinge on on the turnout\nAh Fernando are there a couple of other races that you would point to his ... in which you think that's going to be politically important\nWhile we have Florida ah and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um the influx of Puerto Ricans in Florida and we tend to think about it I think the conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nA temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly in the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nOr the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these\nPuerto Ricans are moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case there's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis on the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor I'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic\nYou know the the Latino bases well entrenched there there are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic than\nThan the than the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican have wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but\nBut it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor Julian Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the midterms because numbers have shown that the rate is ... ... what he said is not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take the change that his campaign done six months before an election or by any one or two candidates it's gonna take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort to get wealthy in those registered and then turn out to evolve a\nAnd until that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move a lot of\nMargaret ... seems to be that almost every cycle we hear the importance of Latino voters in the idea there's going to be a surge but that there is a even if there's greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this\nWas really struck by one of your callers earlier actually left in the middle of this question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the company of different narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know not everybody is asking\nThe right questions which is it's a midterm year are the Republicans who voted for Trump still as enthusiastic are they going to go out and vote for their congressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be one about young voters typically\nIn the past is very low for young voters are they energize they say they're energized is actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I think\nYou know I the the polling attempts to measure a snapshot\nIn time but you could say something three weeks before an election and then just wake up that Tuesday Morning and say you know and that's what the term\nThese questions are really important the president and many Republicans\nHave a I have at least been probably talking again about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and and I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans\nWho have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a ... kind of a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all said and done come down to what individual people do um either for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day\nI Want to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... mayor and I'm Andrea I lame on they spoke to CNN this week about why they're making that track from Honduras towards the United states\nThere's much corruption here in Honduras we want to work there is not we want land to plant bananas teams being there isn't any brother we need to migrate to another country brother and the hospitals there is no security there's nothing or patients die brother\nWere heading to the United states we're going to arrive with Donald Trump he has to receive us\nA you heard there the voices of those migrants speaking through an interpreter is on on on CNN for none of these are owed a vis a caravan it's obviously intended to create a tension or what are the repercussions of it well the repercussions\nCan be many obviously we could have a second family separation policy as it was suggested by the administration or and reported last week that they are considering a new policy in which in a way that they would give somewhat of a\nVoluntary separation option to these families once they were detained but this is mostly right now in the works we we still do not know\nThe details of this but if I may give some some context to this care of and I think there are some politics involved I mean you interview I've seen many of the interviews with people that are coming up and there is a true need\nTheir people escaping their people looking for better jobs are people looking for safety people have been threatened um there's violence in the in the countries of the northern triangle

economic justice tab welcome Don point Hi David thank you for\nUh uh George ... is from Milwaukee himself but what struck you about ah our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest thing that struck me was talking about star code switching and I find that often for me because I Do I Do live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by go to a like a burden go how out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about code switching is basically it's a it's like as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I always listen to NPR or not in the ... school and lucky because that's where I live when I started a as a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame than the going from\nBeing around people all day who look and talk just like me now coming here to people who look completely different than me and had different lingo and different things than I have\nSo I remember my freshman year I Would still talk like normal or I was ill you started playing and people would not understand what I meant by thinker than words or I Would feel different for talking less property and they did so I kind of get\nStarted teach myself that when I met or I talk proper proper English and when I go home I'm able to talk how I feel comfortable talking and you dislike that my family and friends I used to\nYou know there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a start Carter is played by the actor amend the stern ... she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights are poor and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is an affluent mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nA in this scene as I start enters Williamson she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is\nGuiding high to one world\nAnd I got to keep it separate so when I'm here I'm Sorry version to that means slipping a switch in my brain William since died doesn't use slang if a rapper would say she doesn't even for ... says\nHey hey how are you a\nSlang makes them cool thing to me but you know those kids who\nFaced and Kay is that what you're talking about\nYet but it could actually what I'm afraid\nI Wonder ... you know or do you read uh uh uh the book as well if I'm not mistaken or these themes that kind of play out in your own life where you you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburban I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks them how you had the actors like completely different and so because of the areas where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because um\nIt's like you because you are\nBlack saying these words and acting like this makes you appear as hotel makes you appear as less educated than somebody else so when you're around these people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both of my\nMostly white communities and mostly populated with watching it in the way I spoke the way I talked we address the way I act it was completely different side that's when we can relate to the idea of code switching\n... how much like how much of an extra burden that walking around having to St consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway um I think\nWe have because for black people it's this idea of a double identity there'll be always have to face\nThis now\nDimitrius you want to go in there for ... no I'm Sorry okay go ahead for you know he's trying to write a\nStory a library and nice [laughter] I um I definitely think that\nIt's way more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always faced with having to fight so many negative stereotypes it's already approaching this is the first place so I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and\nLearn about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in the world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing by people aren't educated they missed or that their head they will everywhere and blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like so what do I have to perform I substitute it seemed like I can make it so I think\nColored switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people because it's especially a lot of young black people because we're not fully aware of ourselves yet and civil or face on trying to be ourselves but then also face on trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already\nThe idea of perfection other people's eyes what we are\nDumb interested you have a different take on that\nUm I agree on that one Minnesota situations like when I have like a job interview or something I'll put on a voice like not to be like a pill like a white voice that's great but um\nYou get back on ... back to me there are no\nYou sure of course I actually ... what I did want to ask you about a little bit was you know we heard from a maverick who's the father\nOf a stark harder in the opening scene about how important must be proud of being black and at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black kids are boys and girls need to to handle themselves when they were dealing with law enforcement officials\nTo meet you did you ever receive a version of the talk like that\nUm yes a pseudo talk like that when I was younger so how does lay out what was that like um it was just one night when me and my father\nWas like in the kitchen spoken ever just talking about driving and stuff and we got to the topic about police when we get pulled over\nAnd a resort of all I Want to cause pull over like he always put his hands on the steering wheel Antonio I get older and like get a license to do that and like a few months back that happen like the cuts for those over and\nMy father to his hands on his third wheel so I've had my hands on dash or two it was kind of nervous 'cause like the videos administering seeing lately on social media about like the police brutality and like how graphic it can get\nA ... you know uh in Chicago obviously a there's a trial of the uh the police officer who shot ... McDonald\nOr he was found guilty that doesn't always happen or a police officer goes on trial for the shooting of want to start Carter's friends in in the movie the hatred given I'm not going to give away a plot point by saying how that plays out\nA but at the same time you know that was a big deal for what happened in Chicago how has received a you know in among your family and friends\nUm it was received very positively um everything ... the entire thing happened with the Koran so many Chicago activists and organizations had been doing so much work for the ... family for those who are affected by police fatality and\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

movement for justice\nI first want to do to take a call from Tampa, Florida a Michael you're on the air\n[noise] yes um first of all hello and thanks for taking my call Yes sir I'm I'll get I'll give credit and and praised to let you for doing what they're doing but I'm a fifty year old black man and one in North America and I don't think I Would say bad effect that seemed like it got worse\nWhat's gotten worse and Michael\n... the the racial profiling and the tension between races I mean look we got we got Donald Trump ... that's the the attitude and the mentality of\nWhere the state of mind you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws in check and everything and that mentality and psychological profile is still on the leaf off today\nThank you so much for your prospect Michael I appreciate it very much\nDimitrius downward you focus a lot in your group is I understand it and thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's there's a line in in the movie where star Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically\nIf he's in her corner but a certain point he says door you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that how do you approach thinking about uh how\nHow you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face\nUm I think there's respect we need to respect for both both sides um when I was Thirteen I had to\nExperience with stop and frisk and that put me to have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like three or four police can you tell me about ... ... can you tell me a little bit about what that incident with like oh it was like what happened it was scary I was walking around my block\nAl Gore and building to building trying to find a friend and then do it like these two policemen and following me so I started like kind of walking fast because that was kind of scary\nAnd um they called me around the corner and they started to check my ankle to see if I had drugs or anything and\nI had twenty dollars because at my parents and having to pockets and I was just shaking the whole time and they say well you're scared I was like\nThis never happened to me before so the next two years every time I caught like Cruz by me I always like shake up though do\nYeah I mean it you know look I live in New York and have for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among people who make policies in laws about stop and frisk\n... you know is about this issue but it kind of takes away from the human element right like this is your acted not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nAnd the same neighborhood for years so it could start growing relationships with them and just not have a new police or say every month or week like we should start growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and he has the same idea and we're like we have a conversation sometimes I think\nThat that should happen they ship place police officers and the same neighborhood\nAnd there had been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has an a you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood matrix yes yeah\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a Jeremiah Harvey he's a nine year old\nWho is a falsely accused of sexual assault a I Believe in Brooklyn New York uh when his backpack brushed up against a woman in a corner store or the woman Theresa Klein is white she called the police and has since apologized but your mind his mother told good morning America that lake like dimitrius they can't shake the incident\nSo high because of how to play on my own [noise]\n[noise] [noise] not follow up on false how horrible\nAre you concerned that this has permanently scarred Jeremiah yes I certainly am\nDevastated by hand because even after walking away he was pointing to patrol cars on Flatbush Avenue and ... are they he had to take you away from us ...\nPeople tell us that were being over dramatic word that we're over thinking it or we need to let it go but I really hope that after seeing this movie and actually seeing this happens and seeing this happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Madison", "day": "19"}
