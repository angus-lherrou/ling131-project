L. E. Y. travel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking this hour about a Trump Administration proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price of their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring costs down but there is significant debate about whether or not\nThat is indeed what would happen and we are joined today by Dr Michael ... he is vice president of medical affairs at farmers that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us from washing today and we definitely want to hear from you were at one eight hundred\nFor two or three eight to five five it's eight hundred and four to three talk uh Mike Lee borrow there's\nThis is kind of a basic question I Want to ask but I Need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so the first of all I'm saying here that uh the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half billion dollars on advertising in two thousand Seventeen nearly four point two billion of that on television ads\nAnd ha just also says that that advertising can result in increased utilization through patients demanding costly drugs and products based on messaging which increase government costs\nSo I'm going to presume that if pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what a day just to say that it can influence patient choices so if they if they advertising is that effective\nI just want to get to why the the farm industry is is resisting the idea of having some price trans transparency in those ads isn't it one of the best ways to inform patients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost\nShirt so I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do\nIs raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising a pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patients to the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks and Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today\nYou know leads to increased awareness that doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one that the the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important I think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy efforts which is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals\nSo that it's not just the list price that doesn't have out of context it also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient as well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they are I'm faced with situation stressful situations\nUm if you're diagnosed with a serious illness cancer hepatitis\nBe making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiate and in fact there are some discounts that are written into law a Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given\nUm how would that be reflected in a TV ad would that lead to medicate mission to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah there's a the VA has discounts there's discounts negotiated between private insurance companies pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers and there's no other discount programs there was a three forty be discount program so\nThere's no doubt there's no doubt that the complexity of the system is satirist a but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener Facebook a Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what will work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree\nWell I I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see I think that overall it moves the health literacy conversation and the right direction or you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago\nUm the the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression or you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize the variety of reasons and maybe they weren't brought up\nUm and so while you may not like a specific advertisement um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines are there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for thing for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses and maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nIt well Dr Michael uber has standby here for just a second uh because I Want to bring in a couple of other voices\nInto this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist and senior fellow at the health foundation project hope\nShe was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush also an adviser to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential campaign Gail Wilensky welcome to implant nice to be here with you it's great to have you\nAnd also with us joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNonprofit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having me so ... you have an extended experience as the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America\nOr I just wanted to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in pharmaceutical advertising will lead to or could lead to reduced or reduce costs overall that's the goal would have happened\nProbably not a I think having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing that people will make their decisions about drugs based on what it will cost them\nNow with the drug cost is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation where people think oh that's a really expensive drop it must be new and special and and very powerful maybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence\nThe behavior according to what something costs the relevant information is nice\nThe time when a drug is being considered and then the relevant question for patients is what will it cost me if I take this drug or another drug that's really what's relevant patients\nRight and because of the way the American health care system or is right there are so many different answers to that question of what it could cost me and there's\nI mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's not a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there's some pretty general guidelines so if you are on Medicare and have a what is called a um a supplementary policy they'll the general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician or that\nIt's important information because there is a lot of variability but it doesn't really help people\nTo have information about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never going to you know well did that just information that's not going to be helpful to\nDavid mitchell is it possible though that the shock value of seeing these high high numbers for ... certain drugs could I don't know produce public pressure or on the pharmaceutical companies to bring their ... their prices down\nWell first I agree with what's been set already that are putting the list prices on me as it's not going to lower the prices of prescription drugs in this country\nI also don't think that ah by forcing companies to put the list prices on that they will be shamed because the big drug companies in this country have shown that they're willing to be shamed all the way to the bank\nUm they continue to raise prices way beyond as you said at the top of the show a rate of inflation or health cost inflation these take a toll on patients like me I have an incurable blood cancer my drugs cost twenty four thousand dollars every time they'd given to me\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Bush\nNo Gilliland ski I Want to ask you want to just get your view on\nWhat kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous a segment\nAnd that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who rely on Medicare and\nAgainst want to offer some some contacts you're on the differences that might make David had mentioned she Mira a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation or Abbey pharmaceuticals and\nIn twenty Fifteen fourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh an in the United states\nFolks were pay the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug cost Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars and Switzerland the only difference there being is that we've got governments negotiate on on the behalf of patients in those other countries so why aren't we doing that here\nWhen you need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly all guys frequently done and that is governments negotiating prices are governments don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare I helped set\nThrough the Congress that's actually who does that a set prices a they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community and the hospitals ... it's a take or leave it here's what we're paying a you can participate in Medicare or not or as you choose\nUm there is true the federal government could set prices for pharmaceuticals that is what happens in many other countries there's ... has been concern that because of the very long\nPipeline between at the time a drug is first thought about and by the time it gets to market are estimated to be about\nVery long pipeline makes it quite different than other drugs or if you have government I set the price or other physician visit to low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to sensations and the concern has been\nThat if the federal government I said some of the prices too low you would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area\nFor six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there was under the age\nI end up in here and ask you a quick question about that so is is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research while patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost\nWe definitely do subsidize the research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect\nBecause as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment anytime there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along having the FDA do everything I can to expedite\nThe availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact oh we saw that for example with hepatitis C when there was one drug by gilly ad out of the price was extremely high when you had a second proud and come out by ... the\nThe ... up the price of the drug dropped to a very comparable level to the u._k. now that is something we can control okay can do the other\nIt will have a disproportionate effect on the amount of research\nPeople have to decide if that's what they want a and that's what they're willing to live with\nDavid mitchell would you like to respond to that I mean because I've heard this again and again from you know from people like you who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many new drugs coming down the pipeline ten years from now does that sound realistic to you\nKnow I'm a first of all I had an incurable blood cancer or it's incurable because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second line or a drug so\nThe need for innovation a new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but\nSecretary of health and Human Services and former head of a CEO of low in the U.S Alex days are said recently drug companies have tried to tell us we can't have innovation and affordable prices at the same time\nThat if we caught one penny of profits from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation in America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy e oh he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex ... who worked at age age as maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this is a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and new drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's taxpayers are paying we're paying for the new driver the measure the research budget event age next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars\nAnd they do the basic science there and increasingly they actually do drug development and then when a drug shows promise the drug companies would be an end to require the intellectual property and then president four hundred five hundred eight hundred thousand dollars\nAre and we need to return to balance from maximizing profit for the drug companies to maximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robust aren't the pipeline we can do that as a country\nMike Lee boy was that you I heard there yeah go ahead yeah\nWell I wanted to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry to bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget as close to forty billion dollars\nAre member companies and the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year on research and development cc almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments to market and the way I think about it is\nThen age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can't say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem\nI'm from the standpoint of just so much research that's occurring care you look at scientists from around the world that want to do their training here um folks that apply to medical schools I'm from outside the U. S. they want to do their residency if they want to do research\nUh here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have the balance between a investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment it's made on behalf by the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's it's also important to note that our country incentivize as innovative therapies it it it is a different system in the U.S than in other countries we balance a balance that out by bringing\nA generic to market um a patent is so long at the end of the pat and life\nI'm two or three new medicines come to market and the price drops sometimes as much as Ninety percent\nUm and you don't see that in other countries and other countries you see that they um pay more for generics than we do here\nAnd they they don't value new innovative therapies the same way that we do and one other interesting point that I'll just note as most other countries as a percentage of their budget spend about the same on medicines as we do so it's not that um it's not the just medicines are more expensive than the U.S [noise]\nUm but you actually see the health care in general is more expensive and so I think if you focus on medicines exclusively you missed the bigger picture and you miss the fact that there are tremendous numbers of inefficiencies in the U.S health care system that we can do a better job of a you know we could address and we could lower overall cost you know my little cross\nMike Lee but a couple of things are just so you you said that uh\nThat uh once drugs come off patent generic pop up and costs drop by Ninety percent but it is true though that that that a lot of pharmaceutical companies do what they can there not only successful but they do what they can't do extend those Athens I mean we've seen that over and over again with with different kinds of drugs that we have to at least acknowledge that\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

he gave a big thumbs up to ... assigned to the media shortly before um the Saturn five and the Apollo eleven mission took off\nYeah but it's a little bit of a sham of lists or you know the reality is a lot of times you get a massage or if something goes wrong some we're still best choice [noise] lift Australia for [laughter]\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand five uh Jim Hansen you ... you write in your book in the movie explores again who Neil Armstrong was as a man his character his demeanor a and there's a boom in the book where\nYou write about uh why Armstrong was picked to be the first man to step on the moon and and not ... and and if I got to have the ... if I had this right Chris craft to was the chief of flight operations in Houston said ah that Neal was Neal calm quiet an absolute confidence we all\nNo ego meeting why\nWell they knew that that the ... the person who are not just commanded the Apollo and mission but more importantly in the sense of who was going to become a global icon the one who stepped out and represented humanity is the first step onto another heavenly body\nThat this was going to be a big deal to him they imagined that correctly\nAnd uh there was a private meeting between Chris craft and Dick's late in the head of the astronaut corps and George Low who was a one of the big officials and the manned space program and Bob guild Ruth who was the director down in Houston and it was a very private conversation in fact it's this is you don't find this in any records only an oral history coming from Kraft\nUm and and that was that they were having a discussion they they knew that this was going to be\nA big deal and uh you know to the public what they had said was that the person going I first asked Ron going out first would be based on really the interior lay out of the limb the way the hatch opened the way the two astronauts were position inside the ... and\nThat always was what NASA told the public and even told the astronauts as to the reason why they had ... and you'll go out first because the way that had to open it would be difficult for bus to beat the first one out\nBut in truth this you know this meeting was really what the decision was based on and that was\nA they knew that Neal was the type of personality that they felt would actually um you know could could serve as this icon I mean there was a lot of public public relations in a sense too what are you know NASA was doing with the Apollo program and they wanted the right kind of representative for\nFor this and so it was not just a statement about Armstrong or but it was also kind of a comment on bus I mean they knew Buzz Aldrin quite well and they knew he was a very very professional astronaut but they also knew that personality wise you know bus was quite a bit different than the he was very extroverted he was\nYou know he was there was an element of narcissism and buzz honestly uh and they are some commanders in fact when I interviewed Frank Borman who's manner of Apollo eight\nWarm and made it very clear to me that he had told 'em um nicks lightened that he would not accept us on his crew and it wasn't because he wasn't again on a profession astronaut where there were just elements of buses personality which were a little difficult\nAnd Neal could handle them and and buzz and he worked together quite well but they just felt that if you know between these two men there was no question in their mind that Armstrong ... would be the perfect next ... a loon bird and buzz would be much more problematic\nWow interesting but let's step back in time considerably if we could tell us about a Neil Armstrong's younger years they hear that did you first start flying at the age of six\nAnd uh he took us at first airplane ride and lay right I'd hang sick I ain't got his pilot's license on his sixteenth birthday before he even\nTried to drive an automobile he had little interest in automobiles [laughter]\nWhich is kind of surprising for a boy back in that era but he had become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he bought he had his mommy saved every penny from everything he did to buy 'em model airplanes that he built in in flight magazines of various kinds and uh\nAnd so it was really the passion for airplanes and flying you know in later after he becomes first man and becomes this iconic figure um some biographers um you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was\nYou know looked at the stars and big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that's true Neal ... didn't get interested in that so much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened was his career you know ... as a pilot going to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu in Korea\nAny you know Germany will passion on his part as a as a boy but really just sort of the the wave of technology in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night that he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying a or didn't fall but he was just hovering in history\nHe he did have that story and what was I think really a interesting about it was he was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who really you know um I mean there was a spiritual side to win but he wasn't the sort of person who\nWho would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was or what he became\nAnd so he had this recurring dream and so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because you you know I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much of that you know\nUh so he was a very practical minded guy and and and even as a boy was type of type of proto engineer looked at things\nOff as he was saying like profoundly go a goal oriented very ambitious because\nYou write about how you were saying this is a minute ago but it wasn't necessarily some sort of a passion for space in space exploration necessarily that drove him but that all the great aviation accomplishments had already been done any kind of resented that and it was space that was the next step\nYeah that was a you know he he had growing up in the thirties and they were still lots of first that were happening in terms of violating an aviation\nAnd of course reading all those um flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great pioneering flights of that ... of the post of the pre World War two era and he kind of thought as a boy well everybody's got those done and and now what's next [laughter]\nOf course he didn't realize that there are all sorts of things yet to calm\nYeah well so campaigns and I want to talk with you in some detail about an area of Neil Armstrong's life that the movie focuses on quite a bit and that's the death of his two year old\nA daughter Karen I'm so first of all let's let's just play a scene here from the movie first man you'll hear Ryan Gosling who plays Neil Armstrong in in this scene he's asked\nAbout caring staff\nYou know sorry to hear about your daughter [noise]\nSorry for your question [noise]\nWhy what I mean are you think it will have an effect\nReasonable to me that it wouldn't have some effect\nThe scene from the movie first man did hence the first of all tell us a little bit about uh Armstrong's daughter and what happened to her\nWell may I say that in terms of that scene what I what really strikes me um two things struck me the most and that is one that Dr singer the screenwriter used verbatim a quote that I mean what Neal says in that scene\nA about being unreasonable to assume that would have no effect that comes directly from my interview with him back in early to thousands\nYou're listening to the

E. N. G. A. G.

it's the book upon which the new movie starring Ryan Gosling is based that movies also called\nFirst man and just before the break Jim Hansen was reminding us of of course those immortal words one small step for man one giant leap for mankind at that Neil Armstrong said when he first step foot on the moon\nIn two thousand five uh to sixty minutes Armstrong explained what was going through his mind at the moment\nHe said those words\nAre thought whoa on our stuff off I'm just going to be a little step by\nStep they're down to a fair but then I thought about all those four hundred thousand people that are given me the opportunity to make themselves [noise]\nSo [noise] it's gonna be a big something for all those folks in and do a lot of others even were involved projects so it was a kind of a simple correlation for\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand five and how remarkably understated is he James him\nFor people who weren't even involved in that kind of a critical correlation I say it's humility their edible\nDon't you love at first simple correlation I mean I've had that comes from an engineer I think it is\nBut ah yeah I mean as I said and one thing that I I get this question a lot and you know did he come up with that phrase long before they landed meals answer always was that he you know there was some dance and work on the land I mean there were lots of things that had to go right before they actually could\nLand in why think about what you're going to say when you step out and if you're not even going to do it\nSo he's you know he told me and he's told everyone told everyone is whenever he was asked if he didn't really come up with the phrase until after they had landed and they had a few you know there were a few hours before they to get ready ensued up and and that that he posted in his head while you know after the landing was supposed\nTo say I mean it was supposed to say one small step for man\nWell that's what he thought he did say into you know to his dying day that's what he thought and there's actually been a lot of acoustical analysis is done been done by different experts to see and I I was actually at a Smithsonian demonstration were NASA officials are and then Neal back in two thousand four I think it was\nAnd and there was an Australian acoustics a guy who played uh and and he had evidence he thought\nThat in the electronic register of the the sound waves that you could you saw something there that was apparently an attempt to make the aid but it was an audible so I don't know I mean there's no way really I don't think to resolve this completely Neal Neal in the middle way\nTold me said well just put the in parentheses\nWell Jim Hansen hold on here for just a second because I have to say this this moment\nAh for those people who witnessed the launching of the Saturn ... rocket who saw those grainy TV images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin a walking on the moon and also by the way we should note Michael collins or as well\nUh orbiting around the moon alone has Armstrong and older and we're on the lunar surface it really left a as just a lasting impact on the millions of people who remember it because something totally delightful happened to us this morning we got an email out of the blue\nFrom Maria lanes she's in Watertown, Massachusetts because she had heard one of our our little promos that we were going to talk to you today about Neil Armstrong said Maria send us email out of the blue and along with some pictures that she took in Hawaii when um\nWhen the Apollo eleven crew returned to earth and it's just such a wonderful story and that we've invited Maria to be on the show with us as she joins us now real welcome to on point\nI'm making a thank you so much it's it's my great pleasure it'd be with you\nIt is wonderful to have you and I want everyone to go to on point radio dot org and check out these photographs that Maria sent us because there are these beautiful black and white pictures\nOf the ... the air stream of a light a vehicle that uh Armstrong an older than Collins we're in after they came back to earth what were you doing in in Hawaii first of all what happened on that day\nWell I was visiting my uncle Frank uh who and his family and we were very close and I was Thirteen and he was on heck I'm Airforce base is commander of a large see one twenty four cargo plane and that was during Vietnam of course\nThe Vietnam War yeah uh so um we were we got word that the national quarantine facility streamlined trailer a would be traveling behind my uncle's house with the astronauts after they touched down in the ocean and were picked up by a ship\nUh-huh I said the pictures that you sent us\nAnd your uncle standing there with with the uh the streamlined trailer going by and there's another photograph where both altered isn't the kind of waving at\nYou yes yes [laughter] and the feeling was you know that he was just overjoyed to be home I mean yeah it was a giant step for mankind and they actually returned from the moon\nYeah well so all these years later a Maria why is it to that you still feel such a powerful residents to to that moment\nWell uh you know I'm Still astonished at the courage of the astronaut their families the ingenuity of the enormous team that made it all happened\nA and there was some discussion about the movie and uh the book um and that they went up in this space capsule that looks like you know maybe a little bit rickety compared could do that today's sophisticated spaceships\nIt looked like a ten tend to be perfectly honest [laughter] exactly exactly yeah so it's still so so moving and I'm so astonishing\nWell Maria lean from Watertown, Massachusetts a thank you so much for getting on the phone with us and thank you for sending us those remarkable photographs were going to share them with everyone wants to see them on point radio dot org again it's images that Maria took in Hawaii of\nThe mass NASA mobile quarantine unit the streamlined trailer with Buzz Aldrin we from the window after you've returned from the moon Maria thank you so much\nOh thank you I'm so thrilled well\nLet's go now to Margot who's calling from Portland Maine Margot you're on the air\nI ... I wanted to call in and thank you for covering this new movie um I'm the mother of three children and a teacher and um when my children were young I always enjoy sharing with them um people who\nUm had a heroic um tendencies who went beyond kind of the human to sacrifice and to do something for others and I came upon them a musician Jonathan Sprout who things a wonderful song about\nNeil Armstrong as the first man on the moon and it was so powerful because Jonathan music is educational but it's also very enjoyable sometimes [laughter] mothers and fathers listening to children's music and they just you know they have to grin and bear at you know but Jonathan's music is\nUm it's beautiful music and the lyrics are educational man you don't feel like you're being force fed 'em and inspire you and he thinks about\nI'm not only Neil Armstrong buddy things about Samantha Smith who was from Maine and went to the Soviet Union to reach out at a similar time that we're in you know Samantha reached out to\nThe um to to the leader of the Soviet Union and said why is it that we cannot you know we're all human why can we not\nGet along and come to know each other and she traveled there with my dad and um I just think that it's so important in this day and very challenging times politically that can we\nReach across and say we are all human you know we are not one political point of view or we are not one um ethnic point of view or one one creation\nSo let me take yeah it's a very much appreciate your call a ... and that sort of unifying moments came I mean whether there were not everyone felt unified but there was a sense of transcending\nUm usual political barriers in Nineteen sixty nine around the lunar landing a I mean just tell me a little bit more about when you were able to talk to Neal Armstrong many years later about that uh what did he think of that\nOne point Neal mid was he was too bad that it didn't last longer but that didn't last longer of course", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "18"}
