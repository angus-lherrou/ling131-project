F. F. aid to local\nWhether or not you support affirmative action I think it's an important time to be critical of Harvard and to look at how affirmative action policies have impacted are discriminated against Asian American community or Asian American numbers down fighting for lower on personal ratings\nOn the other hand the student Jamie Lee a Harvard senior who supports the University in the lawsuit told WB war that the lawsuit brought by at bloom or at bloom who will talk about more than a minute but says she supports Harvard University\nI think like angry and frustrated 'cause like there's like white guy I was saying about he supports like Asian American their agenda when actually if you will cause track track record it's very clear that he doesn't care about Asian Americans or people of color\nWill joining us now is max Larkin he's a multi media reporter for at a fight WB US education team and he's been covering this case it's called students for fair admissions ink versus Harvard and max Larkin joins us now from Boston federal court welcome to him point max\nHi magna so first of all can you just tell us in a little bit of detail here what exactly is students for fair admissions what are they alleging that Harvard does\n[noise] ah well they're alleging first on the basis of numbers magna you have an increasing number of Asian American applicants these candidates are generally the strongest when you break it down by race or ethnic group when it comes to your academic performance\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas\nAnd they're saying that and the students and the highest ... who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups but I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic dial because it doesn't\nNecessarily correlate just because someone anyone Asian American or otherwise\nScores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic that's out there is no stick statistically significant difference\nOkay Peter would let me turn back to you and sort of a step back here for ... big picture because twice or in terms of when affirmative action has been taken all the way to the United States Supreme court\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... case and in two thousand three and grab the ball injure Harvard's admission process these have actually been highlighted by the justices as the way to use\nRacial factors in admissions at the right way to ease racial factors in admissions and that it's not a deciding factor because\nUh there are many thousands of qualified applicants but it it could be a factor that used in in the entire mix here it was held up as as as the right way to do it so\nWhat's what's the problem now that you see\n[noise] well first of all the the ... case in Nineteen Seventy eight was fractured opinion the court split for for one one was Lewis Powell who Lewis Powell was the only one who looked to Harvard\nAnd fought to its approach to diversity ought to be compelling no other justice agreed with him at the point that remained in the category of Supreme Court ducked the all the way the two thousand three when in the ... case\nSandra Day O'Connor decided to resurrect polled eccentric opinion and makeup law the land so now yes Supreme Court has not instance said that the the pursuit of diversity taking some code of racial preferences\nWould be a a suitable thing the colleges and universities could do not that they had to do it but that they could win and that's where the law stands on this was reaffirmed in the Fisher case a few years ago\nOn what's at stake here is what's been the steak all along which is should the United states be a country that ... law the land is titled six of the\nOf civil rights act and play teen sixty four that no person in the United states show on the grounds of race color or national origin be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits to be\nA word to be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial systems as far as ending affirmative action we could say that Harvard does have other options\nYou could take the option of saying we no longer want to receive federal aid therefore we're willing to put our money aside and in order to discriminate because we'd like to discriminate\nAnother option is that harbored which hopefully and dominant meld thirty nine point one billion dollars could expand and men are the could accommodate students who are qualified and rightly long in of students\nUh Nicole gung ho what you want to give you a chance to respond to that\nSure so I Do want to push back against um this notion that Asian Americans are definitively being discriminated against and I want to do that by sort of talking about the admissions process so I think it is a fiction that\nEvery other score or every other consideration in the admissions process is objectives and\nThat establishes that SAT scores and grades even extracurricular activities to some extent\nSystematically penalize black and Latino students on and some subgroups of Asian American students as well and so I think to sort of look at the admissions process and to look at the personal score as the only one that\nCould be potential Tobias it incorrect because all of these doctors are in perfect all of them to some extent are vulnerable to implicit or explicit bias in the case of SAT scores systematic discrimination against certain\nUm you know racial groups\nAnd so I don't think that the\nRemedy for any of this is to eliminate the consideration of race but it is actually to have race consciousness and a lot of scholars would tell you that the waiter remedy discrimination\nIs to consider race and to make sure that these um that racial groups are treated unfairly compared to each\nOkay so I Want to take a step back here to actually bring in the voice of Harvard University itself because back in July or I had a chance to sit down with Harvard president Larry back how right at the beginning of his his presidency at Harvard and\nWe had a long conversation linked to that whole conversation a at on point radio dot org but I'm going to play an excerpt here for you because I began by by asking Larry back out again Harvard's president\nAbout what he sees as the overall mission of harbors admissions process and is and what it should be an and here's what back out said\nThe admissions process you tried to construct a class to bring together a group of students in a residential learning environment which optimize is the opportunity for them to learn not just from the faculty bought from each other\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

want to join us let's go right to them Mohammed is calling from New York New York mom and you're on the air\nIs thanks for taking my call and high magna I'd really love your program\nI'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question of and and ... are common is that uh in my career where I live here in New York City I worked in a new show\nFor my career I'm retired now and I see the school system in this city public versus the exceptional schools as apartheid structured and\nThe other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that\nAre African Americans have like a ... a of four hundred year deficit and pursuing I'm equity in this country and that's reflected in our schools are going to most of the public schools in this in the city of New York\nOr you don't see Asian and white\nSo Mohammed how are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then to a level that field to write historical inequities\nYes I yes I Do and I think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads in the sand or at Harvard ... less than fifty percent of the student body is is African American\nWell let me take it back to me on on on that point in it and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of voices when I joined so I'm very much appreciate your call oh let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on this morning all as far as affirmative action goals you know I think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean\nYes if it was a for affirmative action some things would have never been able to say police\nBut then there's and and the race balancing but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all for the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida and maybe African American myself I went through some of his during high school and elementary school or I couldn't move this woman and read very much admitted I mean I had to be bused weight over here because of what a million black students going over there\nSame thing during the early seventies would be very violent\nAnd I mean I don't I don't know that it's as a double sided on you know him as far as with Asian Americans with Harvard I think it has with as far as a little personal ... in order to get into school\nI think that it has to deal with the uh\nFrom my experience of them a lot of viewing experience yeah I Know about the Asian community they're not very and culture of and so I think there's going to do with the personal but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those\nOkay I'm going to take it back with you there um ... thank you so much for your call Nicole gung ho chi let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a\nI mean uh uh did you was talking about his experience as an African American male or in this country he also then sort of made some presumptions about the Asian American community as well I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that\n[noise] sure um yeah I mean I don't really agree ah with DJ that as a group Asian Americans are not very inclusive or you know are more about academic than um than anything else I think that is a stereotype and I think that\nKind of a stylish is why we need\nThe policies like affirmative action because our country is so segregated that people don't have the opportunity to interact with each other and to break down the stereotypes and that is one of the points of considering race and the admissions process and to have a diverse\nStudent body at in colleges is though that these barriers can be broken down and what you heard\nFrom ... it was probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions with Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an apartheid system in our public\nSchools So Peter would let me turn back to you here because I just want to get down and I and we're going to I'm going to ask this question of Nicole as well but she's already spoken about how she believes diversity is is part of what's core to\nAn essential on a experience on American college campuses but if you were to have your druthers what would be the basis upon which colleges and universities in America admit students\nWould admit students on the basis of proven ability aptitude determination self discipline the qualities that make for someone who can undertake a rigorous college curriculum and the full range of things that go on in college who lived with him to the maximum\nAren't those ... ... ... to determine it a determination et cetera aren't those are very objectively measured though\nWell they can be objectively measured but there are certainly objective qualities involved in it as well students who do well in their academics through grade school and high school and who hope\nTranscript showing boot expelled and the courses that are available to them and the gone beyond those courses or showing the determination that is not just a matter of somebody subjective opinion about it but it was actually illustrated in their lives lived up to the point\nBecause I keep going back to what Edward Blum the men who is really the force behind this case what he said in two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race in applications so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian plaintiffs now now Edward Blum has a long history of\nAgain bringing cases against affirmative action to the Supreme Court he also challenged the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder\nOr and and won that case that the Supreme Court ah getting on the court to overturn a very key part of the voting rights act so he's been focused on race a lot in America but but\nAh athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why why should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with\nTheir merits there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against a students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean if you look there's a lot of other issues apart from race\nThat a separate that the housing that has not have not in the way Harvard admit admit students\nWell Harvard may be making ... decisions when it comes to the preferences give for ... for people in ... but those are decisions so the private university republic one for that matter are free to make\nSo why do they make the decision also then based on what they see as the mix of students that they need to ... to have a diverse campus\nBecause this country passed a law through Congress signed by president ... numerous Supreme courts which is the title six of the um [noise]\nA Nineteen sixty four law and that just mix of planes that to this country discriminating on the basis of race is no go don't do it\nNow if Congress were to pass a law that says ... north into your preferences for athletes would be a strange law but no such law currently exists this is about Bain law\nI see okay so let's go to another call here Eli is calling from Steven city Virginia Eli you're on the air\nLike now I just wanted to call in because I think a lot of the narrative around this case has been saying that Asian Americans don't believe in affirmative action um a lot of people in the Asian community do believe in an affirmative action um I mean East Asian American Woman\nAnd the majority of the plane 'cause he's cases are Chinese American feeding 'em and that you know they're not under represented in the college scene and the slightest now for a minute action really helps black and brown students in America which Asian American students sometimes I consider granting that I got ... uh Pacific Islanders\nOn South Asian Southeast Asia and the ... you know if this is going to give them a leg up we absolutely owe it to the students to do so and I think this is cases really hurting the overall Asian American community to benefit a few students\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the ideas

and fall the American department store\nAnd Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how fears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country now was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know yeah it's competition was Montgomery Ward also had a catalog in the late Nineteen century um but this was a a wave that's um rural people could\nAccess all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out\nOn you know railroad cars you know across the country and you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nSo the company was founded\nSupport for WPRI comes from visit ... with an assortment of entertainment options like Shakespeare bike trails and bluegrass a trip planner and events calendar is available at explore Minnesota tourism and visit ... dot com\nUm I mean I think the uh they started out as a selling watches so it was just a sort of limited of from in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board\nUm and he took the company into it sort of a modern day for us so I I think that this was\nThe gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between the rich and the poor uh but you know it was a time of industrialization and I'm also movement into cities and\nThe growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it on other otherwise they would have had to travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street an entrepreneur um sort of\nGoing it's small towns across the country and then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nSarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets in opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas ended as Vicki Howard is saying also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many mold in America\nYeah I think in some ways the story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still rural and agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns on and making that adaptation so quickly\nI mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores were the majority of their business compared to uh\nThe catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and speed was mentioned even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think fears occupies such an important place in retailing history in Congress\nAnd so we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with his ears or ... years perhaps at least once in their lives so lots of

you know\nAnd I especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those days about\nI'm an old style manager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with the customer who wanted to order a replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard\nBut he was really really difficult and really unhappy and hard to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy

fault that your wife left you\nAnd I hung up on it\nAnd he called store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never saw before who was a you know young man college educated wore suits\nCame down to you know get my head on a Potter and John stuck up for me uh-huh he said she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat

by hedge fund or or a private equity business at one time\nAh so any land bird today who just stepped down as CEO and who orchestrated it's merger with Kmart he is a hedge fund guy\nOn and he has used a lot of those hedge fund tactics to try to keep here's a flow in recent years so and this is one of the main knocks on his tenure is that he didn't really have emergence instinct he wasn't running series like a retailer he was running it was sort of his hedge fund guys had on and so he is and\nYou know doing things like spinning off it's real estate providing loans are selling things like that crashed into a brand sort of moving around financial chess pieces to keep it alive but he wasn't really making it a better retailer\nWill so should we talk more about this then because they think the presumption when you hear the retailer goes into bankruptcy is that somehow they were doing business wrong but it may have nothing to do with that I mean as a as our caller pointed out we have so many examples Toys R us he's right is another one but it was\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

ah what that means for retail as we move forward in the digital age\nI mean let's listen here to a clip from a Sears ad from the Nineteen nineties featuring Bob Vila home improvement television host also a Sears commercials spokesperson\nTalking about all the things you could accomplish with yours products [noise]\nRemodeling a kitchen or bathroom such a big job\nWhen you try to do it all and do it right [noise] [noise] Hi, Bob Vila procedures home improvement professionals maybe you've been dreaming about immutable new kitchen or updating your bad well if it's too big a job to do yourself trust the job to Sears they've been in business for over a hundred years\nVila there in the Nineteen nineties wanting spheres long history in the retail business you've got comments coming in on our website a debit says Sears was our parents and our parents parents store when I think of the earth I think of craftsmen Kenmore the only\nFact should and can be bought elsewhere uh so that's a comment from our website on point radio dot org let's go to Dave who's calling from Buffalo New York Dave you're on the air\nHi how're you doing doing great day what's your thought for taking my call yeah go ahead [noise]\n[noise] okay yeah you know I'm ... and I said I'm a I'm a current share employee [noise] um I'm a service technician and you know what I'm we're just getting bigger and bigger\nWe're not actually attached to it or how what uh-huh fears is always going to be there as they explained it to us if you think of it this way\nIt's gone full circle years is was a catalogue company like apple outlook for them to you guys talk what's very interesting and you know Sears catalog company and then they started having spores more and more everywhere\nSo that now that the the digital age is here and the millennials vi everything on line just about and I'm I'm a father than kids and I and I go where it's years over the years yeah you're on a great place to work\nAnd I read and um ... full circle\nSo ... so they can just do your do you mean first full circle what do you mean by that because if you say your service technician in ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah I don't have your you know what we're um Sears and the factories are are they in the center for applied to electronic\nBecause we do other I'm like we do um flows Home Depot or rules um that's why we do all the service\nI see Steve along\nWith all the store you know wherever wherever appliances sold redo the orange juice or\nDave I'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a blueberry opinion columnist David he's feeling confident lease for his part of Syria's business and he sees the company's coming full circle what do you think so I think there's something\nTo the fact that the services area is if if you had to call out some bright spots at Sears services would be one\nAnd that's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on that you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances than because uh they had this relationship with you I had their services business so there is something to that that this idea than coming full circle\nI think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and\nLook at the labor's been saying for years that Sears is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of ... okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line is it actually maybe less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I it it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent and categories like apparel it's probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty present in apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar stores fears couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing\nExactly and I think that's right yes this is definitely a story at Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story\nCounterparts I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's are those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nA best buy stock in your all time high as it has staged a remarkable turnaround is taking share friends here and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off price stores like T. J. max and Ross which had been on a hair in recent years and he can share away from traditional department stores like seers\nWell let's go to John who's calling from Detroit Michigan John you're on the air thank\nYou so I bought my first craftsman set of tools back when I was a teenager in the seventies and ours Neal no pun intended die hard a serious person [noise] um and then when I got involved in the communities of Detroit we'll find out that there's actually a catalog houses all\nRight down the street from me that were built in the forties were purchased right out of the catalog unfortunately a Sears is kind of waned on the east side of Detroit or the last Twenty years and it's probably been ten years since I've been in a series store because [noise] I they just don't pause like they used to\nYeah well John thank you for your call Vicky Howard you're the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one myself uh from the Nineteen twenties\nI'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're they're lovely homes and um it I think that they had their special special catalog devoted to to them that closed\nDown I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe on but you know you you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in the U.S on that he might possibly be able to identify them is a serious home\nYeah well so they can hurt a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how uh in two thousand Eighteen yes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and I mean you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so\nSo why is there seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores fears among them are having trouble hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Walmart and Amazon is\nSort of taking over our in our thoughts of you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um\nAnd you know the urge you to occupy a space that Wal Mart to um uh uh now does a as the largest retailer in the country a Walmart overtook the years\nAnd I'm In the early Nineteen nineties so I think that it needs to be seen in through the longer um trajectory of it Sarah I'm signal or her early comments that ... what happened to Sears not just about the last few years it's about sort of long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties\nAnd it it's it's it isn't inevitable um I I Do believe that um\n[noise] uh that all of those uh missteps or\nMight have made a difference you know in the short term of survival of a from like like Sears\nBut I Do think that if you look at the department store industry as a whole that that sector has been a losing out to the big box stores to disc before them even a even before them the discounters target a K. Mart Walmart all all founded in Nineteen I'm a sixty two\nAnd I'm growing up going through the Nineteen seventies\nThat uh the traditional department store of which Sears is it a\nPlace to park you know it's more of a staple\nThe chain right we got sector's been losing out\nYou know so I'm hearing over and over again through this hour uh Sarah ... that a leadership matters right vision and an executive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Madison", "day": "17"}
