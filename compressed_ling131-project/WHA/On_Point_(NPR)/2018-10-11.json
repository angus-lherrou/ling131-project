of the department of biology at Mt Cancer Center\nAnd I want to bring in another voice into the conversation ... and if I could joining us now is Dr Monica ... she is president of the American society for Clinical Oncology she's also chief of the division of surgical oncology at Dana Farber Brigham and Women's Hospital Cancer Center\nAnd a professor of surgery at Harvard Harvard Medical school as well and she joins us today from Washington Britain hughley welcome to on point\nI make that great to be here it's great to have you know you you heard your mouse and described his research and also a you know meeting the first patient that he had he had met one on one who had undergone immunotherapy for her cancer\nA really moving story but I I I'm Sorry if you could sort of described from the point of view of as a fellow researchers so sort of how\nRevolutionary is it that that we're thinking or focusing so much on using the immune system rather than external chemicals for treating cancer\nWell you know there is nothing more exciting I'm a biologist researchers in our field than to see something some understanding from human biology finally revealed that we can really use it to help patients and that was an incredibly moving story that you know fortunately we're hearing lots of these stories and\nYou know that it was it's a couple of decades now in the early nineties that um there was a first the clue that the immune system could do this um\nThere was some work done by Steven Rosenberg at the national Cancer Institute where he found that giving um natural drugs called cytokines that could really jazz up the immune system\nCould really read eliminate tumors in patients with melanoma and Reno cancers and and you know it was it was just a glimmer that this might be possible\nAnd then it took decades of really careful work in the laboratory and understanding the biology to really make this something that could help patients and so it's just wonderful to see the Nobel Prize awarded in this field and even better to see this brand new tool that we have to fight cancer\nNow or are we are talking about treatments and fighting cancer here is anyone thinking that immunotherapy might lead down to the root of a chore\n[noise] so we do see some cures from him you know therapy what is your main you know to to clinicians cure means you have someone who has a tumor\nAnd you are ... somehow something we can do is able to eliminate that tumor and they it doesn't come back in their body um that's what we mean by cure and some of these initial immunotherapy is perhaps the patient that Dr Alison just described she\nTumor never recurring that let that secure so clinicians are very cautious and using the cure word but what really matters to patients is that they live a long long life and never have the burden of cancer in their life so that's what we're seeing and we're seeing that with him you know therapy\nOkay a gym Alison let me let me turn back to you here I mean what do you what do you think about what Dr ... has said is are we talking about potential yours\nWas you know for a long time it's been sort of or you know in Brooklyn and appropriate use words treasure for in a surge severance Bert Bert are groups or burden early for\nMelanoma persons to receive the remember just as a single ... single round of treatments for directions for over twenty percent of them are a lot at least two years after a single tree so [noise]\nUm ... group after a time people can\nQuit looking over their shoulder ever did was wondering if the director of women for them or ... minutes were up much me so happy to vote for sure about Sherman's experience because she was told bird special stone permanent children after awhile ferocious or none of them are more troops were normal life\nYeah oh Monica Britain usually uh I mean how many immunotherapy is are are are out there right now well\nWe have um Fifteen\nCancer indication Fifteen indication so Fifteen specific cancer conditions that are now proof have drugs approved by the U.S FDA\nFor treatment using him you know therapies um but what's another fascinating thing about our field is there are literally thousands at last count about two thousand different new immunotherapy drugs agents approaches\nThat are currently undergoing clinical testing so the field has just been blown wide open by\nBy the proof of principle that untangling this biology can have a true transformative effect on patients last and I just jump in here think landslide two thousand currently and development or in clinical trial\nDifferent agents from hitting different ... different components of the immune system\nUm are all undergoing clinical testing across and when's the last time cancer research has seen that kind of explosion in potential therapies\nWell I don't think ever I mean this is really this is really a completely new era and you know we really have to acknowledge that why are we here we're here because there's been a tremendous investment\nYou know on the part of our government on the part of of of ah industry in understanding tumor biology in a very deep level and that understanding is leading to so many different possibilities for for treatment of care\nI Wonder if I ... I Would I Want to just inject a little bit of not skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong because I remember awhile ago maybe a generation ago\nThere was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman researching angiogenesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of ... any and all cancers in the body very exciting led to research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement ...\nMagnet you couldn't possibly picked a better example um you know we didn't plan on this but um you know what\nThat work that Dr Folkman did to look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Allison's group is developed with ... with came out of his work and\nThe combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that it with activating the taking the breaks off the T cell is producing even better responses in some tumors so at that nothing goes wasted so\nThat's that's correct in the run of the things that we're realizing that are just coming from and ... um\nThere's the distributor therapy can be combined with er about on the other man therapies but was conventional therapies like chemotherapy ... who joined us was therapies virtually anything that Charles tumor cells can be used a prominent in response so that's why there's so many combinations out there so many\nBut we've we've got a really\nIn our house David before decided yeah combination of scale or else we're we're we're going to be going down a lot of false leads\nAll right well you know we've got a lot of callers who want to join us because obviously cancer is a huge issue that does have an impact on so many people's lives\nYou're listening to sour to Jim Allison he was awarded the ... the twenty Eighteen Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work in cancer immunotherapy he shares at a word of the ... of Kyoto University\nAnd you're also hearing from Monica ... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology and chief of the division of surgical oncology at Dana Farber\nBrigham and Women's Hospital Cancer Center and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred and four to three talk so we've got a couple of the top researchers and cancer with us this hour what is your question for them\nLet's go to Scott who's calling from Eagle River Wisconsin Scott you're on the air\nI I'm On a lot of um I heard on the Internet and all my um they removed the choice\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio during the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

where we are with cancer research and why they're so much excitement around him you know therapies\nAnd cancer treatment and I'm joined today by the two thousand Eighteen Nobel Prize winner in medicine and physiology at the gym Allison he shared the word with two hundred of Kyoto University\nGym Allison is chair of the department of immunology at Mt Anderson Cancer center were also joined by Monica ... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology\nAnd a little earlier in the show Dr Britain usually told us that we've never seen an explosion in the terms of the number of possible treatments or therapies for cancer as we are seeing right now some two thousand\nDifferent treatments in the pipeline the researcher clinical trial pipeline and it's a very exciting moment in cancer research but Dr Bert nearly just before the break we're also talking about how how individualized these therapies can be so are we talking about you know slightly different therapies tailored for from person to person\nOh perhaps um you know I\nThere is a whole um\nEmphasis right now on understanding the individual biology of every patient and being able to target that specifically\nUm that not only helps us develop treatments that work better it helps us develop treatments that have fewer side effects you know many examples of this and it's a general direction I Believe we're heading and all of oncology I see\n[laughter] ... yeah in fact just a a burden or he was told you wrote the adage institutions recognize ... many of those or ... or ... that are part of the costs are driven process itself\nAnd so there's a bigger effort arm in arm involved in summer but there's many many groups\nTry to develop rapid ... genome sequencing is that gets faster and cheaper for dinner for ... politically or you're the person ... along with with food\nOr or insured for workers were miner therapeutic perhaps would be much much lower doses of focus the response even more tightly I'm On the Castros themselves well\nJim Nelson and Monica burden nearly um we've got a comment here this come in on our website and that the person wants us to to make a point that I I wanted to ask you about\nTell us at ... coming calling themselves planes dealers says I Hope that in addition to the brilliant scientists involved the show addresses the practical impact in other words the prices of these therapies\nA means to suggest let me just start with you I mean I'm seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars is a cost for some of these therapies that is that right\nIt's ... it's too hot it really is I mean I can understand some of them because I'm a development from for example changed all the rules the standard of importance to choose critically for evaluating drugs that target dresser sales were yours for a more\nSort of a lot of federal trials because we use the wrong end points from shuttered searchers are developmental costs were immersion regard as well probably the most expensive or I'm not sure [noise]\nBut still that's no that's no reason to keep those promises a perimeter now because we certainly don't reflect the costs too much of a drug it's also the daughter come down project with us we're going to be combinations where my\nHeart you know from remembers outside or butter or go to work from home for ... put more pressure\nYeah Monica Britain usually I mean I Know that you neither you a gym or setting prices of for drugs that are are that are coming out of clinical trial I Want to acknowledge that ah and also we've heard frequently over the many years and and Jim just pointed to it that the development costs are these drugs are very high because sometimes that we're talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean the both of you are in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because their costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots it when it comes to availability and access to to health care in the United states\nWell that went in there now ... you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and you know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs\nIt's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus what we can do as doctors and his researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients\nIn the best most efficient way\nBecause then it's it's not so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more is when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and has not and really as as clinicians researchers that's where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to Lindsay who's calling from Jupiter, Florida Lizzie you're on the air\nHello Hi Lucy go ahead\nOh hi thank you for taking my call\n'em I wanted to counter all this talk of excitement like my experience of frustration over me out there I'm fifty two years old I was diagnosed with advanced\nStage three ovarian cancer which statistically had the terrible survival rate I'm like I'll be very very very lucky that still alive and five years and yet every day on NPR I hear about these clinics with all this and you know therapy\nThere's nothing for me and so my question to your research or its is for someone like me how many years I have to try to stay alive you can conventional methods of treatment until someone comes up with an Iraq there either it's going to throw in my life [laughter] you know what I mean\nHe lives he hang on don't don't hang up the phone here let me just turn to Jim Allison first a gym together as well as\nHer you know what I mean one of the one of the roots are going about immunotherapy is because there's a lot of cancers the were uniformly fatal before a bitter now responding unfortunately they don't respond them in ... group ... really her mother responded much at all yet\nOn over and his one which doesn't respond for what's the frequency ... large um so what were involved\nOr from Missouri reports from Jewish daughter oh what goes wrong not only am persistent are successful girlfriends were precious received combinations of don't work and try to figure out what's missing remembering remembering irrational word uh prefer ins are missing I'm trying to\nYou know move it forward ... ...\nWe're we're ... we're we're just made a very for\nNo Lizzie Lizzie did I hear you correctly when you say that you've been searching for a clinical trial to participate in but you can't find one or one that you call that will that you qualify for\n[noise] um yeah that's correct I found one but I don't think they're saying it's a vaccine but it's like ... which I think that's different from you know therapy but it's also one where there's a fifty percent chance that don't get a CBO uh-huh route out with a vaccine same thing as them you know therapy as a Democrat\nOkay Dr Europe for ... ... different ... yeah\nMonica weren't nearly I mean what would what would you would guidance or advice would you ... have really because I imagine that there are many other people like her out there who would like to have access to these treatments even in the clinical trial phase but for whatever reason cannot well you\nKnow you have two questions you know ... to issues first Lizzie thank you so much for calling in and for sharing your story with us because um this is something that absolutely needs to be raised every time we have a discussion about some great breakthrough\nThere's just always so much more to do and I hope very much that you are in an environment where you have expert doctors who are doing everything they can for you because um\nYou know there's there's a lot that can be done but there's still a lot more to do now the issue of clinical trials again was he thank you for illustrating that how the importance of that\nI'm One of the things that one of the big problems we have\nOnly three percent of patients adult patients in the United states participate in clinical trials\nTo Ninety seven percent of people out there\nWe don't have information or even access to them for some of these new um potential breakthrough therapy so one of the big a part things that we need to advocate for is more availability of clinical trials and those trials need to get to every tiny community not just the big cities for people who have insurance yeah\nYou're listening to the ideas network of

O. P. N. Y. that\nThat was that moment occurred the day after the last presidential election I mean I was somebody who was viscerally instantly opposed to Donald Trump from the moment that he came down that escalator at Trump Tower\nAttacking Mexicans are rapists and murderers I couldn't believe that you had a mainstream candidate who was talking like that and I never imagined that he would win the Republican nomination much less the presidency and so I was very dismayed to see Trump's progress\nFirst and the Republican primaries and then in\nThe general election there was the shock of my life and I think many people's lives to see Donald Trump actually win the presidency and the next day I knew what I had to do which was after a lifetime as a Republican is a movement conservative\nI re registered as an independent because I knew I just knew at that point I could not be part of this Trump provide Republican Party\n... well so I mean seeing movement conservative do what do you mean by that\nI was part of what was known as the conservative movement from a fairly early age I was a conservative columnist at the University of California at Berkeley\nI was an op ed editor at the wall Street Journal editorial page I was a regular writer for commentary in the Weekly Standard I was a foreign policy advisor to three presidential candidates so I was fairly deep within the conservative bubble\nAnd in soul crushing experience for me to see what's going on\nWell uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI I think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly\nBut for many of the others um they did heap praise or upon a President Trump now the whole sort of a person by person moment took about eleven minutes and we're not going to play all of that obviously we've got significantly cut it down but here's some of the the flattery\nThat members of the cabinet where heaping upon the president in June two thousand Seventeen I think he was president\nLottery has to leave for our health services at this time on your leadership I Can't take enough for the religious\nThat show\nI Want to thank you for\nThe virus senior staff\nHim Mr President for the way I'm given your\nRadar traveling around the country for the last year even greater are to be here sir I have it\nSo you heard their vice president Mike Pence then secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price transportation secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\nA no Max Boot you know many of these people can you explain a they're they're ... seemingly unquestioning unquestioning feel teach to the president\nIt's it's really a cult in what ... and I think they feel it's necessary because they understand\nThat that Donald Trump is an egomaniac who is also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's his cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on\nBut you know that that tape that you played some is to my mind\nIs one of the most revolting an on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this is not what should be happening in the White House the people's houses in our constitutional republic where we do not elect Donald Trump as king he supposed to be the president charged with in forcing the laws\nAnd yet he was being treated by those around him as if he were the leader of a religious cult profoundly dangerous to be\nTotally cynical about this ... is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity in this party is around the president of the United states\nForgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think that politicians have a higher duty to their country into the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans that I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham an on and on and on\nWho have sold out their beliefs\nWho will not say in in\n... in public would I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president and why won't they do that because they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the\nThe Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against them he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people the worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better to lose reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their way very\nLet me see I'm trying to figure out the right way to ask but ... but can't the argument would be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles though are what got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your vote for support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho who cast their votes for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of a of international elitism gone to arrive that that was that was money and effort that should have been spent right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nA a a principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War in two thousand three very those same people surrounding themselves or or ... surrounding the president right now so what is it not inevitable in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including\nThe mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that\nDiscredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy and I I ride in the book and in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and soul searching way\nAbout my own responsibility for getting here I was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with Seventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than than most of that Seventy two percent and for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounced my decision and now with\nThe clarity of hindsight and looking back and trying to figure out in my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a queen breast of it in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nIn I was wrong to have advocated the war this is a terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I\nAnd I think that other you know supporters and architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's of course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though you won't end but it now but but there's no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way\nA an open the way to ... which you know I think it was it was a catastrophe for America and the world far worse than what we've seen in the past because he is\nA you know undermining our democracy with those attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad he's undermining American allies he's opening the way for dictators so you know this is the terrible situation but you know we have to be honest and and admit\nThat the Republican establishment was not blameless and getting us here\nYeah well we're speaking with Max Boot this hour his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk a max it's got a couple of callers here if we can let's first go to Mike who's calling from winter ville North Carolina Mike you're on the air\nMax yes\nI agree with your analysis completely I think Trump an absolutely horrible president I was telling all my friends I could vote against them in the primaries\nBut leaving a party a terrible mistake we need to fight for our party and hope that someone like I have a mental block on flakes name or ... or some decent Republican comes in and challenges and still president Tony Tony\nFight against him leaving the party is is just wrong\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public

Republican Party also believe that the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think that uh in the in the twenty twenty cycle that the Democrats might actually\nA nominee a centrist versus the someone who's on the more progressive wing\nWell I think anything is possible I mean who would've imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump or twenty sixteen so we don't know who the Republican not who the Democratic nominee is going to be twenty twenty but there is no question that almost all of the\nMajor contenders that people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees are certainly from the progressive wing of the party ... and that concerns me as as somebody who's uh who's more of a of a centrist center ripe a person\nYeah let's go to Jill who's calling from St Petersburg Florida until you're on the air\nAll right thank you um I guess my my question has to do with the fact that a Christian\nI talked to a lot of bike riding on it and I'm starting to call it takes most of my Christian friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say that the Republican uh whereas um most of my other friends might have other nations are some type of crap\nWhen I find that people that aren't religious are Republican gay or minority whatnot it usually has to do with the money that and wanting to be able to preserve their money or their future so the question is it as a liberal Democrat Chris\nI thought is that for the good of the world to take care of each other and all of our government is to make sure that everybody gets by and everybody had a village either have\nA question what was the original point of having a conservative wing of the party back when you join and get it a lot of the religious right in any way sway your decision to abandon the\nJoke yeah Jo thanks for your call go ahead max\nThe religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties uh and it's dismaying to me to see what happened with with with with that one of the party that you have until it goes I mean I agree with a lot of them in in the late Nineteen nineties when they were cast of getting Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these arch Moore listens colds\nWho were criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions then you know this is a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off a playboy playmate on a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a president\nWho has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of\nOf of a bill Bennett bark from Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen Ninety nine called\nThe fact that more people were not outraged about Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrage is actually pretty good description of the ah of the of the Christian right or today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say about the shocking your morality of the president that they support\n[noise] ... I Want to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's the question with this issue of race uh and and how that is shaped direction the Republican Party is going in because I'm I I'm thinking of\nUm you know the number of times you pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people looked upon and said that that was racist but\nDid you ... around him you know thinking of house Speaker Paul Ryan ... going so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks but ... but nevertheless I'm going to still support the ... the United states because he's helping deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important\nTo a lot of people so far as long as that you know your your term ... bargain exist what hope do you have\nA for change if the if the change has to come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated and devastating defeats\nThey have to know there'll be a political price to pay for trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political game there is nothing I've seen in American political life in my lifetime that as more despicable than those they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he used for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his racist baggage when he you know we're undocumented immigrants this is a disgrace and the Republican Party use discretion yourself by going along with those well\nLet's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Ira you're on the air\n... food food I Would like my hat off to you I Am in total application of the courage to your show and the intelligence analysis you will absolutely correct\nAbout the current situation would be no doubt and man and woman integrity face down Trump laid out for what he is a true ...\nTotal dictator and another Hitler\nWherever I Need to be an odd it's fair we our great nation we ran through the hard and fast of the civil war and we find it to gather choke I'm ... years to probably do it we pretty much on it now\nBut the one who will never recover\nAs it Margaret she read will recover but evangelists people who support or ... one percent and now when I was a sense they shown recover their their chance to be a religious or moral ...\nIra Ira let me just jump in here for a second before I let you go I I hear what you're saying and I hear your passion a lot and I'm going to have Max Boot respond to it for a in\nJust a moment but when you when you said that you see the president as another Hitler\nIsn't the very fact that that is the the tenor of political conversation in America right now isn't that part of the problem because what you yourself said with all due respect to Iran is also incredibly extreme in any it makes it hard to have any kind of a ... you know civil coming together in this country\nNo future generations will realize that he was in fact in the age of it is ... is it not yes John ...", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
