to look ahead for in this week's news Caitlin Huey burns joins us she CBS News digital political reporter pure Thomas is also with us chief justice correspondent for ABC News\nAnd Michael Moore joins us to today he's senior writer at the Weekly Standard and of course so much attention focused on the FBI's current background investigation into the allegations are surrounding judge Brett Kavanaugh a and we've got lots of comments here on our website on point radio dot org\nJohn in Amherst says lying and allegations aside as someone with Kavanaugh has demonstrated belligerence unbiased capable of serving as a judge on any bench let alone\nThe Supreme Court well in fact this weekend Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona was asked about that on sixty minutes this was just yesterday a and here's what he described he saw in Brett Kavanaugh temperament during Kavanaugh's testimony last week\nWhen I heard him heard someone who\nAre who are would sound like if I had been unjustly accused and to see his family behind ... and ah\nIt was there was anger um but um for the fire were unjustly accused about is how I Would feel as well\nAnd the Chris there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was also interviewed by sixty minutes and a correspondent Scott Kelly asked tunes are about the the claim or the assertion or the belief that parts of Kavanaugh's testimony and his demeanor in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line\nA lot at all surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a partisan argument that would've been best left to be made for his advocates and defenders on the committee made you wonder about a shooting building\nIn my case yes it made me wonder about his ability to survive and\nThat is democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there and I keep making the same mistake I keep seeing Mike Judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here a ... burns let me just pick up with you 'cause you're speaking to this point before\nThe break here I Wonder um you know all day on Thursday Democrats focused on their call for investigation\nThey got one they got an investigation you know its current terms they may not like\nBut I'm Wondering if you think they missed an opportunity here because you know many folks did look at for example that paragraph in judge Kavanaugh was opening statement where he talks about a left wing conspiracy he talks about the Clintons 'em\nAnd you know that and perhaps some folks might say they should just simply point at that uh as evidence for of what you know might be judge Kavanaugh suit ability or lack of for the Supreme Court\nRight I think not paragraph was particularly revealing for a lot of people watching because um remember we're talking about this seat as a potential swing seat on the court from I'm at a conservative ...\nBut when Kavanaugh was talking about the Clintons and the left wing conspiracy I think it did raise questions about whether he would in fact be a partisan I'm a political type of person\nAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if the conversation starts to evolve this week away from the events in question and the Nineteen eighties and more towards Kavanaugh's suit ability for the court or the question though and that the point that I Would make is that\nYou know a lot of lawmakers made their decisions about ... even before these allegations surfaced you had many Democrats come out as soon as Kavanaugh was nominated or shortly thereafter saying that they could not support him and you had lots of Republicans\nAh really cheering him on\nSo there is a question of you know how much the events of uh that we learned last week how much we learned this week\nHow much it will actually change minds I think Republicans also are considering\nThat the idea that they have wanted to shape the makeup of the courts that's been an organizing principle for them in election after election\nAnd so they have to kind of weigh that against the allegations that they've already heard and against any new information that comes out this week that pertains to the events in question and also that pertain to Kavanaugh's a personality and his fitness for the call him\nWell Michael warn me chime in here because if as Kaitlin says we do start hearing more Democrats talking about issues of temperament well that argument hold any weight now because there has been so much emphasis placed on allowing the FBI to investigate\nA magnet I think if that's where the argument shifts this is Caitlin suggested might\nUm it suggests that Brett Kavanaugh I was going to be confirmed as a Supreme Court to uh to the Supreme Court\nI mean this is I'm a respect for you I think a a a ... that his uh his testimony his anger in that are in that testimony on Thursday or somehow revealed something about the kind of justice he would be\nWhat we're not hearing is any sort of analysis of his actual time on the bench he's a he said on the DC circuit court one of the most powerful or courts in the country or in this claim about his partisanship has never been made a perhaps a bribe somebody will now perhaps somebody will go back through some of his decisions and find it but so far they haven't\nI'm a ... and I think Jeff Flake is giving it something here rubber flick is one of the three Republican senators I'm we're on the fence about cabinet none of the Democrats\nAre who are who are including Chris Coons were mentioning they're concerned about his temperament oh we're really ever going to vote for him in the first place um will Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski a and Jeff Flake a change their mind because of the uh the angry way in which\nCabinet responded to what he claims are smears\nUm I don't think so if if this the investigation finds out the capital has lied about this or has lied about anything anything else that he's been accused of that will change things up but but the anger on display or I think a a won't make a difference with the people who who matter in this decision which are those three Republican senators\nAll her take a quick call here on this point let's go to Rick who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air it\nRicky their omega Hi go ahead ...\nUh\nI really don't have too much faith that he will not be pushed around a district court or you're going to be asking [noise] perhaps ... glass and if he is a appointed confirmed um when will he will have to decide\nBecause it is a flash mob to carry it or the or ... or conspiracy or to the other members of the court decide [noise] one recusal should and should not use her\nRick and Rick thank you for your call peer Thomas you want to pick up on that because uh I think if you know a judge Kevin on Thursday he talked about well funded left wing groups et cetera and if you're one of those\nQuote unquote left wing groups and you bring a case before the Supreme Court would you be right to be concerned about a ... a justice Kevin I so if he so becomes his ability to fairly educated a case like that [noise]\nYou know it is interesting um\nA lot of the things that were said again we're out of anger I think what the caller is picking up on his invoking up with Clinton for example that some people thought that that was\nA a bit too much in terms of the judgment whether he recused himself the justices have a lot of latitude to determine what they feel like we may have a conflict of interest on a but most of the judges and in many of these cases see themselves as the arbitrators all the facts\nAnd if it's not often that they recused himself from cases\nAll right well let's go to another call here Reggie is calling from ... Iowa you're on the air Reggie\nYeah so I was wondering if he comes back and so it can find no evidence to support Dr Ford or any of the other\nWas a single Democrat going to vote because they made up their mind up for Justice Kennedy said he was going to require they were voted no on whoever was nominated I don't even think the Democrats in the Senate you argue that the covered with those they want to vote no\n... Reggie thank you for your call ... burns feeling Joe Manchin is the one one Democrat that keeps coming up\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office to say here's the list of people you can talk to full stop\nBut we don't know if they have to go back to the White House who say we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident can we go talk to them\nAbility and the authority to go do that\nUh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most and again the question here and we're we're tiptoeing around it is\nIs there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client their directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they want answered but at the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kavanaugh approved confirmed\nAnd there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that's been made public at All right\n[noise] well in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators all one hundred uh who will vote on his a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill a little bit different era now\n[laughter] so so much has\nSo much and yet so little at the same time and change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who is not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he\nTold Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection\nHis decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different\nCould you have done this\nIf you were running no [laughter] no not yet not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to Puerto ... there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nMichael Ward I'm seeing here also is just a recent study from cue that says that uh Seventy six percent of the potential mid term voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee with a process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this\nA it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says\nThat the political parties organizer animosity and that you know politics is as much about uh uh who do you hate or maybe a little nicer who you are not like who do not want to see\nIn power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been a and organizing for ... for Democrats who who sort of woken up in our on our or expecting a a good election in the midterms um\nMy question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up an an energized to vote in the midterms\nI think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans a have a have been energized huh I don't think the Trump Administration as it's gone on a has given him Republicans much to be excited about\nPerhaps a and walk away to see how polling is a week or so after the uh the the hearings last week\nUm perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege may uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had\nA for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the way that uh that women voters might respond\nI'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite of here that you might expect and say that I'm actually judge Kavanaugh's treatment\nUm ah as make them more willing to go out and vote for Republicans we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this is something that does animate voters a in a way that uh that that that does energized from to get out of the ... ah in November\n... fact we heard the president himself over\nSupporters and saying you know if you want to\nPreserve the uh the futures of of judges judge Brett Kavanaugh go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look we've got so many comments on our website I'm seeing your saying\nThat a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the cabinet nomination the women of the Senate block it or he is confirmed and\nThe women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that is a comment on our website on point radio dot org let's go to Steve who's calling from Bangor Maine you're on the air Steve\nI Would agree with that oh that is absolutely I find that in my own ... you know all of this will go um it's a generational thing where we social media is lit up but I think there\nAre a few meals are are motivated you know they listen to their mothers or the grandmother you know uh the slogans like really come a long way and we are but this is like\nWhere we haven't we still have men mostly now in there who are making decisions you know on a ... you know talk about sexual assault in the last ... still haven't done nothing control the military and the\nAnd and so I mowed the bottom line is meals are motivated organizing a Alexander Alexandria court as New York court gee that's another one yeah like all ... you know you don't really have a woman can't really you know get out of the kitchen\nWell Steve you know since you brought up the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a victory there I I Want to actually take that and thank you so much for your call and turn it to Caitlyn Huey burns because you know we heard Michael say earlier just a minute to Michael worn saying\nThat um you know he asks and I think it's a good question uh you know how many democratic voters are they're left to be woken up for these midterms um uh but as the caller pointed out there's the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a race in New York I had a ... victory in Massachusetts as well I mean to those\nThose those campaign so they want because they brought voters to the poll who's ... who had never voted before so you could the Kavanaugh stuff further galvanized those young people\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public

she was the head of the FDIC from two thousand six to two thousand eleven\nAnd we're talking about the role that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation played in a the financial crisis in getting the nation out of it and what she ... now when she looks across the financial system whether she sees a healthy system or not and Sheila ...\nJoins us from Washington today uh she live there's a story that you tell in your two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns if that's the story that the very beginning of the book and it's just\nIt's so telling us how hoping you could read if you could share it once again with us and it's it's a story about um how you in two thousand eight in October to designate you attend is very key meeting at the treasury with Hank Paulson\nAnd I believe what a seven of the top CEOs are the biggest financial institutions in America\nYeah well that was um [noise]\nThat was quite a quite a meeting I was thankful and they called it I was there ... there Tim Geithner was there the head of the other banking regulators or were there\nAnd um the purpose of the beating was basically for us to tell the banks that uh we were going to take some interventions and that we wanted them all to participate there was this they there was a you know the ... the court center piece of it was the tarp capital investment yet are going to\nPut under the veins of dollars into new capital into these banks are the FDA she was going to start within limits and for the we're going to start a guarantee a the debt that they needed to issue to roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own\nTrillions of dollars have learning disabilities that they they put into place and so it ... it was basically to explain those new programs\nAnd uh they had to take the money well yeah I you know and as I say that I think a lot of that was a was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city I think most of them not all but most of them probably could've bumble through\nBut so we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you just singled out certain banks for\nAssistance you are going to make them look very bad and you know exacerbate their problems right so uh yeah that was the reasoning\nWhy I kind of just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about\nI think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight you say this is a meeting a Monday October thirteenth do those neat you say nine men stood milling around in the room meant I should note right nine men [laughter]\n... not really [laughter] ... their buy treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you're right I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there was even balance of power and and I still\nThink we suffer from it that uh you know who works for he does it just doesn't work for the banks are you know or did just that the banks banks and the safety net the get FDIC Deposit Insurance and fed access and all of that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fulfill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these government supports like Deposit Insurance can can incentivize a risk taking and too big to fail\nJust really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power and he was in charge and it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't when looked like it looked like I was awake legs so uh you know I think that some of them told me they're afraid of me I don't know if there that's a\nJoke [laughter]\nI Can't I Can't\nBe a little directed at times I Will be the first to admit that but I Do think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge and well I mean I just\nI I'm I Am so the numbers of looking at them the sentence written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me\nNine trillion dollars and edits Seventy percent of the U.S financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected to feel that\nWe had well it it\nIt is and whether we fix said I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously he and I have had our disagreements and in their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need\nMore bailout tools and I think that's absolutely the wrong system that's the system we still have that we don't want to say that system but you would like banks go down now oh well we we have something called title to in which we did not have a ... in two thousand eight and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed\nTo you know put it back into a resolution process to break it up you know keep his bad assets out impose the losses on the shareholders and the and secured creditors which is where the lawsuit should be more the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy\nTo fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the break you know and and you're bringing new\nIn in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process there is a mute unique things about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to you is\nThat is a tool we didn't have and to them we have now the regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind the markets that this this is going to be the new paradigm this new process not bailouts but accountability\nFor going to ask you can ask you know of course so many questions to live there because I I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist has not ... not I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis\nI mean as long as the banks are too big already won a blizzard\nWell uh there are people who have that view and I can understand that view and ah I don't think there's a political will ah in Washington to do that I mean and this is bipartisan unfortunately you see\nLegislation going through now that would reduce three the largest banks we have reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed and in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress testing\nRequirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say 'cause I'm a Republican and I thought you know Republicans are market oriented water Republicans trying to pressure the fed to reduce capital even more so that's the political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter]\nThat's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else and and my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThey finally happens but yeah I mean if they needed a bailout again I think ... our democracy cannot survive that and if they think\nSedated and again she lived her I said I don't our democracy cannot survive another round of bailouts it just it can't look look at what happened you know people who discount the role of the two thousand eight crisis\nAnd and even you know the eight million a homes lost nine million jobs lost you know the the terrible hit to the public purse still people struggling and lower middle income families um\nThat started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... and ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's in the discontent we have right now so to suggest that we're going to bail out so yeah that that's going to be the new paradigm\nThat we don't really need to bother regulation trying to prevent crises we just need to be repaired with more taxpayer bailout tools I don't think democracy is going to tolerate that\nWell you know so okay that's quite a bracing thing that you said and yet ... of than speaking with you and other people who were very key to the uh in the two thousand two thousand nine period any financial observer most people say we probably will have another crisis though so how does that square with our democracy yeah well\nIt's a if it well like I said you're hearing different he's in different people [laughter] I'm not I don't know that we're going to have another crisis I I I think we but what I think we should be doing now that we are towards the end of the cycle\nWe should be preparing for the next downturn in economic cycle if banks have enough capital unstable funding to continue functioning when\nThe economy turns you know and their credit losses go out that's what happens in a downturn if they have they are resilient to continue functioning and continue lending we will have a downturn we will not have a crisis or even have a deep recession it's all about how we see the financial system is which is why now\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

answer around two thousand and why are they they're well to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote\nAs long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran\nSo listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're at one eight hundred for two three to five find this eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lives it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is ... rent for he is a reporter\nYou have things for having me\nAll right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by the way it's been a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the prior U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern Syria in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded\nSo the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including secretary of defense Mattis\nThat us troops are only fighting ISIS however they do play a secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country a\nBoat and kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us to withdraw is ah the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters that waste\nRight so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey ... or the state department special representative for Syria\nA following John Bolton comments said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission again until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right they're they're counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers all ... and I'm its affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq\nAnd so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission\nUm and so I think that the way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to cook it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... raise ... description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region\n[noise] well\nI think people on the scene at the price by the second one coming out against you learned that we've seen yet because as you remember a few months ago um ... take the chips are going to be going home very very soon and it was actually an expectation that they would be caught on by the end of the year\nAnd most of the regional palate I'm involved in Syria that she Russia Cherokee\nOn everyone else in the neighborhood and being expecting he likes to go and they tried to catch up on the ... the\nIdea that that actually going to be staying I mean definitely definitely puts them back like in the picture when it comes to negotiate cheating and then she could Sherry and more and I think it should be on our Web that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric on ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nYou cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be held\nOf the military objective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and here you're going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton\nPressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission of fighting ISIS\nThe problem is that national security adviser John Bolton state of the United states intends to keep an indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces that to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran\nEspecially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of a wrong not actions of ISIS or the defeat of ISIS\n... let me ask you about this because it seems as if what Congress and molten is saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that\n[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're\nIn the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria means that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has shown a willingness to get a new authorization to use military force ah I mean that's a question of the Aspen brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks\nSome people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from two thousand and one could I've been to\n... know Liz Sly me in the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said\nWe'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to ... to stability and peace in the middle east in the region\nAnd to that effect you today you just went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show the Israelis it wasn't a missiles like can you tell us a little bit more about that\nWell yes I'm\nAt the United nations I'm not speak Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture\nOf took off that he's had little shops like Jim age and with the think like ours on it seemed to cut courtship ... sites that\nWet Hispaniola purge at the store in manufacturing filed to be which could be used to like one in South such gate the let the he's fine ministry invited ambassadors took all the countries that them but you can walk up and then\nUm did you go and visit she's arts people to fight to see that they don't contain any child\nSo what we did was we went to flexible we went to a golf course but that was part on state Michigan to laugh so then they put you back on the buses and we went to a sports club ... and ... other sports type stuff\nAnd then we went to a warehouse with kind of and she ended with designed to show us a check for the rich no in fact storing it in his house in the sights although it was very hot child\nFrom the very typical picture which I'm next to Nancy flashed up the United nations exactly why the site where anyway and um so it was very hard to tell if we were in the same spots unlocked and that ... and he didn't see any trials\nOh okay so ah but to sew but regarding for", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "01"}
