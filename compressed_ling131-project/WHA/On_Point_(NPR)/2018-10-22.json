Chinese music playlist yes\nIt was it was like MP threes if you remember it was a it was a it was an older machine that they that it's that they found this on it also found some examples that people um I I it's sending out or or being are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tampered with and that way although they had no conclusive evidence and so we\nHave we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on any of the machines are no because we haven't done those forensic audience that you're talking about\nI I I think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now are being put on us but but keep in mind of course that now are spent on basically everything these days yeah there's a strong chance that it's that have happened and I'm just not aware of it in a few people are well\nEric Rosen buck Kim points out\nThat some states use these this particular machine model six fifty to process the ballots for entire counties and you can imagine in closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Bronner University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found even when they identify flies is that they don't get fixed\nSo is that a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] there's a really important point so to begin with this is not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty four team the Russian intelligence services attacked the boat tabulation machine in Ukraine decided to sort of try to suppress that election you can see them easily using that same playbook on the U.S\nOn the question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clothes and proprietary based on their bottom line interest of trying to make money\nAnd were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security\nTo find vulnerabilities um someone big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nHas just come in here because the the the level to which some of these ah these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as ... as reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference\nThat er ES and asked election systems in software actually I Believe sent a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary we have copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nIt's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether\nI don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced explanation it reminds me a little bit of back and the older days when the the music industry was so adamantly protecting things in a way that didn't allow new technology to emerge um so I think there's uh\nWhere they're unfortunately we're under resourced and so don't always have a lot of money to upgrade systems aren't keep their security opted into pattern so there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this is more on the ... not being as transparent as Bush won\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania deputy deputy secretary for elections and administration a post she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to on point\nI think you up first of all let's just let's get your take on this um E. S.

S. and as first manufactured it um in Nineteen Ninety nine and discontinued manufacture those units in early two thousand eight so major vendor they're saying there isn't a problem ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all that I just want to point out the ... six fifty is is a high speed central count scanner that is not used at polling places but I I I think that\nI'll agree with their premise that all the computers are vulnerable and that Ninety nine percent of our votes in the United states are counted by computers and so those computers need special handling and in order to manage the risk that\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that indeed who you are\nThat is indeed who I Am\nWell Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in or how is it the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we've we feel that will shape we ah\nWe actually started working on cyber security of our election system because gee uh at that time we did it all on risk and ball ability assess but um\nWe had any recommendations or a potent you eat in a low priority and it'll have consistently work to\nJuggle all those recommendations or other and said that we also\nA tradition as we continue to do a a regular up other patients as well uh and\nI think that that the important thing to remember most\nOf most of your listeners is that uh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very just east centralized modern unlike most would we have county government all level ... is a state level or in\nAnd you know we've got a lot of things going on and I sat on a panel was and bomb it back in the march before the Senate committee a you know we are now at that time to your implementing Asian yeah go with one of applications are walls of the ...\nWill secretary says she kind of somebody just jump in here your cell phone dogs also shaky here but at this to this a key question when I ask you before hopefully your love life will fall apart but\nI'm seeing here that even given the steps that you you said you've just taken there in Vermont to ensure the security of the voting a system there as much as possible\nI mean NBC News is ... reports that in August in late August there were three different methods used to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone try\nTried to get access to your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did it loved it but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the oil that has a website or anything that isn't getting ... and do what we experience was scans are a lot\nA lot a large systems showed us\nWhere they were coming originating from ... you can always count on that but when they raised our attention if you want to call it um was one that said Russian Federation voted on on\nA department of homeland security to the communication calls that we have developed over the last year\nAnd I think that you know our systems are getting and thousands of times per day thousands of times or the question is how to cook the systems in place to defend against it\nBack in two thousand six in the recording ones they were targeted yep one state reached\nAnd uncles the conversation was always about on state we would never adopt a twenty that are actually a defended again\nWe was reached you know I I haven't I haven't heard of that which state which was breached secretary condos\nOr was I Believe it was I Believe it was a um Illinois\nOkay interesting well one last question for you briefly because they want to turn back to I guess with uh with what you have to say but but I mean you're the state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in elections security\nWell now let me let me speak for myself and I must say it up\nWhen you visit there are some practices that we need to always\nOne of them in older marked down that was really the only way that you can actually audit oh we do what we call we usually hired just confidence level audits randomly selected ... pounds after thirty days election\nI'm doing her sister thousands rubber on a discrepancy\nYeah well a gym condos the secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call\nYour walk\nA Mary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what the secretary of state of Vermont had to say\nWell I think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that I said earlier in the show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis of machines or\nAnything like that there is a statistical sample of these ballot of the motor my paper ballots so that you can check and make sure the software um was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing risking vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor today the same thing\nAnd I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes\nThe elections are run onto the governor's jurisdiction sometimes they run in a very small secretary of State Department says the level of resources is going to vary widely ... I think we keep coming back to this resource question\nWell let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHi Meg now\nIn Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machine we switch to voter mark valid combined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning\nWe have locked suitcases for each district\nWe have a\nStickers that keep the voting machine from being messed with unless\nSomebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by\nA board of elections on those uh audits sheets how many ballots they ... they come shrink wrapped in a package is the fifth day we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots to people that aren't showing up in our um our in our election bucks so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the affidavit valid and\nHave a chance to vote when the voter gets done marking the ballot they have little circles in them for each candidate and amend that yeah they take the paper ballot you get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through\nAt the end of the night we have people who\nBreak down the voting machine they a scanner and we have to memory card inside of the scanner\nOne of the memory cards were able to pop out and we physically hand to a runner\nWho physically takes it down to the board of elections too so that they can do a quick audits that official unofficial southern get it on keeping us up and then um [noise] there's also a second memory chip in the same machine\nYeah we'll get a ticket I'm going to take the call back from you on that point and thank you so much because you said a lot of interesting things that I Want to hear from our guest reflect on so Kathleen election inspector from Syracuse New York Thank you for your call\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I ... he took us a really interesting place in just before the break here but I also am a little concerned that maybe like this interview is getting a little to NPR eighth I Want to own a Lebanon it a little bit with a moment\nFrom ... drag race here it is\nMan made\nThat is ... making her exit from season ten or in one of the ten thousand me mobile moments that come out of ... drag race or how much fun as it to make that show\nOh my goodness that is so fun you know we produce the heck out of the show we put everything together then we a drag queens to them and then [laughter]\nHowever already ensue [laughter] but not only be the hilarity but the heart and the the courage it's so amazing and the stories that they tell a it ... it turns it\nIt turns what we've produced into something of legend and of mythology and magic\nYou can so about those stories I mean over the course of the ten seasons of drag racing for for folks who don't know actually I should let you explain for folks who don't know what the show is I mean but how would you describe will drag races well\nIt's a competition reality show where we are looking for\nThe competitors through a series of challenges\nThat are not unlike what my career has been I've done everything you could you name it in show business so the challenges are geared towards you know being a radio host or a TV producer a model or acting all those things\nAnd at the end the two competitors who are\nAt the bottom who get the least points have to lip sync for their lives and uh\nThey lip sync and or whoever does the best gets to stay and the one who doesn't have to leave the competition\nAnd you always remind them too don't bleep it up okay that's as close as I'm going to get to it on NPR here yes I mean it is the ... the show's combines\nObviously just the the visual spectacular ness spectacularly already making up words now a of the drag queens the the the challenges that you just talked about the fun and the incredible hard road I'm surprised that more of the queen's just don't have a nervous breakdown on our own every episode\nBut with each passing season we've also seen a lot more of their personal stories as well and I just wanted to play a little bit of a montage of three moments where we learned some very\nIncredible things are about some of these drag queens say here are those moments\nThey got me exercise because they thought I was ...\nI was so confused after the whole thing went down because [noise] straight now\nI just wanted to say and I know and so friends [noise]\nI've been living with ... with a

and more you start with all the ... century word comes from ... who are more jobs better much\nLovely [noise]\n... you didn't just getting better\nNew got\nThe well the three drag queens you heard there were just you mean bottom talking about ... having to undergo gay conversion therapy on giant on the very first season of drag race revealing and she was HIV positive and the last one there Kim chi talking to her younger self\nUh about the challenges that she faced in and a rip off I remember correctly ... parents didn't even know that she was on the show that she was a drag queen or even that she's gay right\nYeah right yeah you know that the the show challenges the contestants to\nFiguratively die and become reborn into their higher self and when I look back on my own life I realized that the worst things that happened to me ended up being the best thing that happened to me because I got to understand what real strength\nIs and what my own strength is and I think the people watching our show uh they get that and they they understand that at the core of our show it's about the tenacity of the human spirit and how you\nAre an extension of the power that created the whole universe you can access that power at any time but what ... you know when you're pressed\nIn those horrible situations that these kids named when you press that when that power comes out to anybody out there is listening to us right now understand that what you're going through is part of\nA your metamorphosis and and sometimes you don't want to and I say the same in our country right now which seems so divided and so\nUgly but I have to believe that\nThis violent metamorphosis beauty will emerge and that's what we watch it on our show every season after season we see these kids who have gone through a lot and they they emerge as great beauties and heroes\nYou know and and the thing about the show is that there's that intimacy and the challenges but ... as you said earlier there's also fun at the drag queen drama and just straight up laugh and\nI really think we should give everyone a sense about how entertaining the show is so I Want to play a clip this is from season six and a regular feature where the queen's dress as their favorite characters for ... spoof version of the comedy game show match game\nAre you ready to me are stars\nWater\nThe\nEarth did you ever get him coming up haunted I dress like that like downright Scott say well I thought it was a holiday and tell me of rain [laughter] playboy playmate and reality T. V. pie and hair Anna Nicole Smith is here\n[noise]\nOne of my [laughter] I got a thing that's really become [laughter] that's\nA scene from ... drag race a you heard drag queen Bianca Del Rio doing her judge Judy impression and the door Delano as Anna Nicole Smith in the show's version of the match game\nOkay look we've been talking a lot about drag race to show recall which is just one of the most recent things even doing and you're really long career and we've got a question that's come over Facebook for you\nPeople really want to know more about your early years in drag so Rob ... says please ask grew about his start in public access television in Atlanta\n[noise] well um I had been a working for my brother in law for many years in his car business he used to flip\nA European cars and also American cars but expensive cars\nAnd uh I had I done you know I'm drama school and I'm performing arts school and all that but I was sort of hovering in it and when I was about twenty I saw a TV show in Atlanta\nOn public access so I wrote into the show and asked if I could be on and I would would attracted me to the show was a\nThey felt like it was my tribe it was the tribe I had been looking for in fact it was to try that I had\nKnew existed because of\nWatching public access ... from watching public television watching the money python's flying circus when I was about ten years old I knew that's my tried\nSo I'm ... years later I I saw public access in in Atlanta and a man named Dick Richards who um answered my letter and said come on come on the on the show and\nIt was off to the races for men because they indeed were ... they were my tribe and Dick Richards are put out my first records on his label and uh he was a mentor to me that a a really kicked off my career and I I wouldn't be here without without him\nSpecifically when you first started doing dragging me what was it that drag gave to you that you didn't have\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Charles recall his host and producer of the Emmy Award winning repulsed drag race of course\nWhich completed its tenth season just recently on VH one poll has a new book out as well it's called ... and if that weren't enough already in March of two thousand Eighteen a ripple became the first drag queen ever to be honored with the star on the Hollywood walk of fame\nAnd Jane Fonda presented him with the honor\nI'm really honored to be here I looked out and I see the star that's going to go into this walk of fame but I think it should be at least three sides is bigger\n\nAny other star on the walk of fame because I don't think anyone else on the walk of fame has ever launched an industry like root ball has behind the glamour\nBehind a drag queen\nIs a man of great doubt\nIntelligence compassion one member of our crew said that ... than that he felt his blood pressure drop when he was around them\nPaul with his star and the Hollywood walk of fame in March of two thousand Eighteen now recalled Jane Fonda also writes the uh the introduction for your new book grew so so what's the connection to her\nWell you know I'm actually I'm I'm actually choked up hearing that a her say those things so lovely you know I I've always admired her in fact when\nWhen she showed up on the cover of life magazine in March of\nOf Nineteen sixty eight at our house I remember a emulating the post on the cover of that life magazine she's it she's on the cover as as Barbara ... and it was a pivotal point for me because I thought so much beauty so much strings\nAre and then I ... years\nTo probably to the day she gave me the\nStar she presented me with the star on the Hollywood walk of fame but I've always admired her just because of how many lives that woman has been able to fit into one lifetime and not coming to this\nPlanet I always felt like the boy you fell to earth ah that was always my goal and that's why drag shapes shifting or wearing all these different hats in show business has always been my goal and I've always looked up to her for that but um before that I just it on her show Grayson Frankie a\nAnd a with a Lily Tomlin and it was absolutely beautiful and that's coming up on the next season of grace and Frank yeah\nWell you know we told folks over social media that we were going to be talking to you are today and we got so many questions from them that I I don't want to give them short shrift you mind if I ask you some of the questions that we got sent to us here\nI don't mind if you don't mind me saying I don't want to answer that [laughter] 'cause you don't lose it you know people have a lot of ideas and that's that's cute but uh you know we'll see okay here we got\nOkay how about this how about a\n... okay how does this is a a pretty easy one how about this one then church wants to know that he'd be interested to know what the change in the audience for a drag race with more teens and young people watching has influence how you conceive and produced the show\nNo it hasn't you know our goal has always been to a to celebrate the art of drag and the art of\nThe people behind drag in and tell their stories because it's it's it's a very unique person\nAnd personality who's able to ah ah change themselves and and to die voluntarily die and become reborn into another\nIncredible image of their own imagination there's something very very important there so uh know what happens is we produce the show and then we add the queens who were different every year every season and it takes on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag a in part driven by the success of the show\nMay may have a change in the community itself that's because under son she wants to know that and someone calling themselves Django James uh wants to know what's the best way to tackle the racial bias issues that have become more apparent and drag race fandom as the show becomes mainstream\nWell those are two big ... the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because uh in our ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is\nI'm a ... will never take cold because the ego will not accept the idea of someone changing their identity oh we are\nOn a density of consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is and drag is the opposite of that drag says who now I'm this didn't oh now and not\nSo drag will never be mainstream uh now I'm you know racial issues it's it's um with within the drag it what ... what happens is\nUm we get a lot of young people who have ideas of of of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas um I I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with um the fact that a lot of young people\nThey gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show\nWill have way more a social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind so that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this Earth I'm a ... it has very little to do with\nOur show because our show I Believe we ... our show is the most diverse ...\nA a cast in television we have we cast everybody in fact I think\nUh uh this past season without giving anything away well yeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little T because they who we have on the show um uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much [laughter] you have your token white folks with uh we found some\nBut listen you know we we cast the show based on the criteria is what it's charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking this question but I just have to know ah\n'cause I'm a huge ... fan and then and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that that that you you dropped her from the showing that in that great lip sync between her and trixie Mattel\nAnd I just don't think she was ... what happened there well\nWe'd first of all you need and so Rob because ... is almost steals the ... the movie star is born she's in that movie and she does a great job in that but the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner\nOr even as you played the the the clip of misfit Angie she did one episode and became an in turn to Asheville stuff [laughter] so you know um nobody loses if if you're on the show you're a winner\nOkay so that actually leads me to something else that I wanted to ask you about because\nThere's been a lot of media coverage of recalls drag race because it has become so popular has really uh elevated the careers\nOf the drag queen to appear on the show to super stardom level as you said but I think it was in a big New York times article a while ago that talked you know is there a risk in the dry and community a little bit between um\nThe clean to get to be on on your show versus the many many many who don't because you know I've been reading that\nUh you know people in booking shows now folks are looking for a recall girls essentially who've been on the show and perhaps not booking very hardworking drag queens who who just haven't been on TV [noise] yeah well that's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Madison", "day": "22"}
