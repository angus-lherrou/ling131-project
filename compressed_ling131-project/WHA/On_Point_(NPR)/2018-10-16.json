becoming less and less controversial as the Saudi Arabian authorities have shifted their story\nI see oh they are no they no longer appear to be denying that anything happened to your mouth because

relations following the disappearance and reported\nKilling of journalist and dissident Jamal ... showed gee I'm joined today by Steven Cook he's a senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations and also joined today by Bernard Haykel professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University\nA and a professor heckle ... before the break you said ... it's worth exploring further this question of a President Trump's relationship\nWith the house of salad and then perhaps we should even focus on Jared Kushner and his relationship with crown prince Mohammed or been some on I mean how would you describe how close they are\n[noise] well you you probably know that the first overseas trip that President Trump took was to Riyadh yeah where he was fed and and received you know as a great kind of international statesmen and he you know seem to appreciate that\nI'm a lot um and then a special relationship developed with ah the president's son in law Jared Kushner and to deal with a whole series of uh topics one was uh the fight against ISIS and the ... campaign at the other was the Israeli Palestinian peace process\nAnd last was of the uh relationship the business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis were um instill our reforming diversifying their economy they wanted to invest in the United states they want to buy a lot of things from the U.S and build strong connections with us institutions\nBanks universities et cetera so that relationship is is is a very personal and titan one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the uh attention and angered that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with\nUm the feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump's\nOkay well Steven Cook though the ... the president has said that he he would vow quotes severe punishment right if\nIf a Saudi or influence or south of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ... uh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a\nThat punishment to affect arms sales for example I'm a ... at least ten billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what position does is put the president in\n... president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think his statements\nHave a be in an effort to\nProvide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story I think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and who's inclination is actually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia a uninterrupted\nI think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis was or something where the White House was acknowledging a the pressure and the two weeks for commentary about\nThe disappearance of democracy Ho Chi\nUm but uh overall uh this is\nI'm not made human rights or a priority and hum has looked upon ah Washington's relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned a hundred and ... ... a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal uh which actually was not struck by the Trump Administration but was actually agreed to under the Obama administration but signed after President Trump a came into office yeah\nAnd I appreciate the correction that I had said ten billion but you're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal but it's not point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements this long standing relationship between these two countries in the house sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nDoes that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed\nMultiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other well\nThat has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now\nA given the fact that the Trump Administration regard to Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region in Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer the United states is\nUm but still many of the uh Washington is most important allies are trading partners do rely upon a oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that the United states is interested in in a global capitalist water or the fact that the Chinese the Koreans the Japanese the Indians\nAre are all depended upon oil coming out of this region in significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia\nThe United states has a a compelling interest\nA in a radio stability in supporting Saudi Arabia security well I think so I just\nWanted to get its okay I just want to get Bernard Haykel you in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between ... between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm I I think it is impossible and I've described the relationship as a structural relationships on a transactional one even though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War and the fight against communism their instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible and global market which means that if any disruption happens in Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately\nThey are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American or an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have Islam you have to fight against uh\nAre instrumental again and fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAnd a mom and been some on M. B. S. because he has made it a policy of the kingdom to turn away from Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if he if he succeeds in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right also there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or MPs\nI Want to play a clip here uh on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage and heads point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitments of human rights\nSteven Cook what does the United states stands to lose perhaps\nMorally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing close relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\nThe listeners on line who's who's talking to us about what about uh you know remembering the terrorists that came from Saudi Arabia after nine eleven and again in Yemen comes up over and over again there's a U.S a hundred year famine that Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe\nA ... in the world right now largely driven by Saudi bombing there and it does not the United states stand to lose something by\nI don't want to call it an unquestioning relationship but they're so close it close in tight relationship\nWell this is the central dilemma for American policymakers who want to ah to secure American security interests around the region\nUh who wants to fight the Islamic state and wants to counter Iranian influence\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I mean I personally I think Trump could care less about her show in that interview on the White House lawn yes I was you know another act it's another lie I mean I Am hoping\nThat Congress ... you know get some intestinal fortitude hair and can can do something yeah um and it showed the global dictators that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump a gift and Donald Trump\nBut that the U.S Congress is going to start taking some action against\nThe human rights violations that are occurring around the globe\nWill delivers thank you for your call Steven Cook let me turn turn that to you a first of all\nThat the president's own rhetoric against journalists may have emboldened ah folks like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYeah and this is something that has been part of the commentary since uh the first reported missing a mock choked gee I'm In I think that certainly\nIt's unfortunate that the president refers to press as the enemy of the people ah it certainly under scores for dictators around the world that the the White House will will downplay attacks on the media but let's also be clear\nUm people like Vladimir Putin's Turkish president rich of type ... won a others around the world the Chinese um are are arresting journalists harming journalists\nSo one can imagine that uh if this decision was made at the highest ah levels in Saudi Arabia they looked around the world and they saw how the Russians are killing people and small British towns or in Dupont Circle Washington DC Dupont Circle who tells the Chinese are rounding up people turkey is the leading jailer of journalists in the world\nNone of those countries have paid a price for that and that ah the Saudis must to believe that they wouldn't pay a price either so I think yes in part it does have to do with a President Trump's rhetoric but I also think it is in the international environment that transcends a that transcends president\nTrump okay so I'm going to explore that a little more in the second specifically regarding some of the things that ... G himself had has set about a\nA crown prince Mohammed bin ... but Steven Cook there was a point that you mentioned a much early in the program that I should have dug deeper in into and that is\nUm how much does the president's personal business interest in Saudi Arabia first of all what are they specifically and how much do you think that is influencing uh his approach to this current diplomatic crisis [noise]\nWell there's all kinds of allegations concerning the president and his family's business ties with Gulf monarchies I'm I'm not aware that there's a Trump International hotel in Riyadh\nUm but ah there are a extensive links between the Trump organizations in countries all over the world and this is a a continuing question whether ah the president is making decisions based on his family is a personal financial interests or on behalf of the United states\nUm we do know that um the the government of Qatar through a an investment fund has invested in a building in New York City that was in tremendous debt that's owned by the Christian or companies\nCut their in Saudi Arabia are at odds so um there's a lot of different ah business interests\nAnd it's very very hard to pinpoint specifically about how the president is making a decision on on these issues\nI think any president in United States would be in a tremendously awkward position with allegations coming from a ... a NATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had murdered someone and they're constantly in in in Turkey is you know main city\nOr how the president would respond to that if anybody occupying the oval office would be trying to weigh the ... how much to emphasize a values and freedom of the press and protections for the press\nVersus a relationship with a country like Saudi Arabia well\nAnd look the Saudis spend a lot of money in Washington right the Washington Post is reporting that Saudi Arabia plowed twenty seven million dollars into lobbying in Washington just last year making it one of the highest spending country seeking to influence U.S policy that's according to\nPublic records uh well let's take another call here said is calling from Green Bay Wisconsin said you're on the air\nThough I Am calling to write an alarm bell\nUm the situation I'm In terms of bending to the political domestic political forces and international Middle Eastern countries themselves the greatest violators of human rights who are trying to exploit this situation in order to affect American foreign policy\nI remind us of a similar situation we were in in Nineteen Seventy six or ... American president Jimmy Carter may human rights they central piece off his foreign policy\nPricing pressure on the bench I'll be on a on human rights record\nResulting displacement and the conversion of a cautionary can ally at the ... then to the greatest American Fall\nAnd as significant deterioration of human rights or in Iran resulting in over a million Iranians you get ... seven million in exile\nAnd Seventy million living under tyranny is what happens when when one American foreign policy um treats human rights as if they saw and point out does not understand the strategic dimensions that are involved in that in in our relations\nSaid thank you for your call a Bernard Haykel what is how do you respond to said\nWell I I think he makes a good point and the and and the story that he tells about Iran is a is certainly true um\nI I think that ah you know the the point that he's trying to make as far as Saudi Arabia is concern is that you know there is a very important strategic relationship here\nUm that the that the states that are engaged in let's say the Turks are with their campaign of of uh of leaks ah some of which may be disinformation we don't know whether they're true or not the Turks are allies with the Qataris who hate the Saudis the Turks and the Saudis are rivals\nUm the Iranians are rivals to the Saudis so one has to be really careful or in\nComing to a conclusions about what to do as a result of of this tragic episode I think that the most important thing is to focus on is a crime was committed to get people punished for the crime\nBut not to jeopardize the relationship that we have that the United states has with its strategic allies in the region because the repercussions of let's say undermining Saudi Arabia and causing\nA the weakening of the regime there could be a civil war and let's not forget that in the middle east we have four or five failed states with lots of war is raging and similar one uh you know God Forbid in Saudi Arabia would lead us to a military intervention possibly in in this region and that's not something we want to get involved\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I knew that through my through reading\nAbout concussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you uh retire players there's just so much content out there so many stories and I can't [noise]\nUm I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about lowering layering concussions together and having concussions very close together in a very short period of time and right\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something um changed about choosing something couldn't correct\nWell can I just I've been here for a second because ... you really you write about in the book about how right after that that crashed that did that second hit a Talladega as you were saying like you were more emotional less less restrained I mean\nNASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track at two hundred miles an hour but are you seeing the book that now I was just angry angry all the time that you drove your car back to the garage and ESPN had a TV camera there waiting on me big pack of reporters\nHe started talking and your eyes get why volume picks up and you're faced are turning\nRed and here's what you said\nI Can't believe that everybody is no\n... nobody simple enough to\nRealize just how meticulous that was a man was hey is ridiculous if that's what we did every week I wouldn't be doing it I'll just put it to you like that [noise]\nThat's how he writes every week I'd find a job it's blood thirsty if that's the way people must have long Lance ridiculous I don't even want to go day tell her ... year\nBut I got much choice it's really not rice and I don't know it's just as they sold is pointing out at all when I was like [noise]\nA lot of money right there is just a lot of wasted I mean if\nThis race and that's how we're going to continue to rise and nothing's going to change a NASCAR and build the cars so there's a lot of money\nDale Earnhardt junior how out of character was that for you\nI think it's pretty ask out of character to be that\nUm to be that aggressive I think was out of character for me\nAnd I could feel a mom oceans I'm In a moment you know sort of not knock it feel myself not being able to shut up you know not being able to buy my lip and and and keep those opinions to myself because they were going to do mean no good bye\nI'm sharing them and that in that environment and I did get some pushback from NASCAR about those comments to particularly the bloodthirsty comment and [noise]\nUm they weren't very happy with me and I know better than that you know I Know NASCAR will enough and and my intentions in my career had been to try to lift the sport up and be a great representative for the sport and then that moment I was not doing that and I couldn't control it [noise]\nThat was the worst part about it in and um [noise]\nI could not control my emotions and and with that injury having just occurred and I dealt with that for the next you know forty eight hours a day\nTrying to calm down trying to make sense of what I was feeling I'm trying to figure out what I was going to do about it um and luckily I got pointed in the right direction to see\nA specialist in their surgeon to a that was local in Charlotte a doctor petty yeah\nAnd so that man got that right there was the saving grace for me because I don't know whether I Would have made the right decisions going forward to take care of myself I Do not been put in front of the right people\nYeah so we got a lot of college when I talk to you and I want to get to the right just a second here but but but let me ask you mean the way you write about are the kind of hits you took we we were talking about two big ones there but also there's a lot of 'em I'm putting smaller includes here has a NASCAR nothing's really small\nBut you know 'cause everything's going so fast I I just wonder how many of your fellow drivers have had concussions how often do you think drivers are behind the wheel\nOr you know in these races with their uh you know not at a hundred percent because of the effects of of getting hit in the head all the time\nI think it's very rare I actually do um I feel like that that crashed in two thousand twelve with an anomaly for me I feel like that it was a um you know just a unique\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

he suffered as a top tier NASCAR driver a he's a two time winner the Daytona five hundred Fifteen time winner of NASCAR as most popular driver award and an earlier in the hour we talk in detail about two concussions that he suffered in two thousand twelve but those were not his first I mean in the book\nDale Earnhardt junior writes about how in Nineteen Ninety eight for example his car rolled in a race\nAnd his head hit the roll cages so hard that his helmet had put put a big dent into the bar that was in Nineteen Ninety eight crash\nAnd then in two thousand to April twenty eighth he crashed during the Napa auto parts five hundred at the California speedway infant ten of California\nWhen we're talking [laughter]\n\nMontgomery mouthing Martin and bring job would be more memory and everything else [noise]\nI think we've got ripped off\nThat's all it is yeah definitely that long pause that's what everyone hoped it all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision and a ... a man than in the car was the only thing that really could help me decide ah [noise]\nYou know exactly how bad the situation was or how long I needed to get better I Know better next time I shouldn't again that is sacred as much as I did but\nI Know I didn't want to cause too much alarm because it really wasn't a serious I guess everybody has made it out to me\nIs Dale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two\nWell joining us now is Michael Mickey Collins he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program and he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior four concussions in two thousand twelve he also wrote the forward for\nA racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to on point\nI make now or it's really great to have you because obviously as as Dale writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office\nI mean you treated thousands of of of folks in professional athletes I mean what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\n[noise] well I've seen him shut deal twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale we actually got they'll better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw Dale he was very sick with these issues that we commonly see with concussion\nAnd quite honestly I I didn't care as much about Dale becoming a race car driver again I I Want a deal to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd then just jump in here though because I mean the the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book\nUh there was a vision problems balance problems uh on the central all the things I hand eye coordination all those things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving at two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life you know ... racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar initially we saw Dale and\nAnd you know we really identified will learn a lot about concussion and and there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the labyrinth signals coming from and and matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with the L and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and said I'm On a course of rehab that um that eventually got him better and and Dale is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nYeah so uh but Mickey Collins I think one thing that surprised me about what they wrote in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very\nVery specific specific regimen of exercises and other protocol essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when brain is healing from from concussions\nI that's a common a perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment\nWe've actually identified now that there are six different types of concussions and there was some types of concussions were quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated but in details profile of difficulties the way you treat the problems that Dale had it's actually ... training and so\nHave as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach or whether the rate regulation or whatnot but you have to you need to go to a clinician can identify again whereas the average single coming from and then in the national right tribute to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because\nThis is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous event is thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nYeah well Dale Earnhardt junior and in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins that you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver culture is like but you did hear from some drivers who had either\nPreviously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help\n[noise] yeah actually that was so ah interesting I guess I'm you know a\nHearing from retired drivers or even drivers that had just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and look and just really just to be able to contact Mickey had to get a Pittsburgh where he was in and see him [noise]\nUm that was\nI think the beginning of the\nReason for writing this book and make you told me time and time again\nOr whether it's an article someone's red or he's read or whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here and he'll tell you that he has people that come in every week that um connect\nUh you know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be open and transparent\nAs a result in this book and ah you know so that I I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's you know I've made friends by meeting strangers\nAnd directing them to Mickey in continuing to support them and continuing to you know encourage them through the process and made some pretty good friends to\nSorry to interrupt you there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Mickey Collins said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that are you are so concerned freaked out really about uh how much you were struggling after your your dual concussions in in twenty twelve that that he told you\nThat it could be fixed now ... why did that and why was that so profound for you\n... you know he did that on a couple of occasions I had I'll I'll I'll toss I'll talk about this one in particular I had my eyes were not working I'm not focusing not I couldn't they weren't stable if I walked across the\nRoom they ever you know the ... the environment shook and I my eyes just wouldn't\nUh wouldn't settle and it was so so frustrating\n'cause it it was there every minute of every day and it affected anything and everything you did\nAnd it was there for months it it wouldn't getting better I was working and rehabbing and doing those doing the exercises and homework that Mickey had given me and it wasn't\nChanging and uh I was getting more and more worried and so I called Mickey enough to make you really just got to ask you something real quick and I said to have you seen this problem\nAnd a cause a a patient's ... patients idea\nStay positive he's not gonna be a negative person and tell you this isn't going to work and this is what you got a new you know he's going to be positive because he believes that he can fix it and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Madison", "day": "16"}
