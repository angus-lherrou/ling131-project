of transformative learning more and remaking dog education [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're going to spend some time taking a close look at judge Brett Kavanaugh's testimony that he gave before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony says\nUh about his character and whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court now and we're joined by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece entitled\nHow we know Kavanaugh is lying that sat on the radio dot or the link to it\nAnd like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House for a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe Ford and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org\nOkay Nathan so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through a couple of them and get your analysis and of course and it goes response as well\nSo here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific phrases that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book\nDevil's triangle drinking game how's it play three glasses trying and you're quite quarters you know ... it's a quarter scare\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nUm because nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence that this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh's mouth during his testimony\nDevil's triangle is a common flying phrase for a free some\nAnd uh it's a it's a sexual ... and uh in\nBrett Kavanaugh's testimony she tried to paint himself he tried to the reason this is important is because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself as a kind of innocent in high school he said he was in Virginia but to charge you volunteer soup kitchen\nHe helped intellectually disabled children and this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him\nWas crazy it was totally out of touch with the person that he was not devil's triangle is actually a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the more important ones are like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern and that is one example of a huge pattern in which Brett\nKavanaugh evaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college says to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of a guy and ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the Senate to know that and so he didn't admit\nOr any of the things that suggested that he did actually no power and think about sex in high school and uh things that would make for that gives you more credible\nWell uh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kavanaugh said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to a PDF and actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly remove later but but Nathan they'll let me\nOn this a little bit because we also see um I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so\nWho has been pushed to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper partisan this moment is that he can he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to you know what might I don't know I'm just what might be like kind of a junkie things that Seventeen year old boys say to each other\nBecause it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something\nMuch much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think the hyper partisanship of the moment may understand who make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things\n... the problem is that there's this thing called a sworn oaths and you take it when you testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh as a federal judge and he's speaking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty of the whole point is that you have to it's a it's sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth\nIt would make the allegations against you would look more credible in fact that's entirely the point the reason that he lied about these things is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it would hurt a him in his attempt to make Christine forward looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd if a green what are you saying that\nI watch these parents because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found the votes to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd P TST symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible that though she may have been assaulted it was ... I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been him the proof ah in the number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person and then I hear people like a Nathan Robbins and saying things like nobody's ever heard of the stringing came everybody knew\nWell those are not factual statements we have people on the record under sworn an oath like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character sixty five women from high school saying we've known him for thirty five years this was what he was like\nThat I that that seems to be discounted which bothers me as a person who's really interested in the truth and to me saying statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew is an example of that faith analysis\nAnd in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and his examples of why this drinking a meant what he says it means which I find kind of filthy minded honestly\nIs nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which\nWe didn't have a Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have I I wasn't in the DC area Nineteen eighty three\nUh but that means he's lying and the additional proof as a nation friend Pete Davis who went to high school in the DC area\nIn two thousand eight\nThat's not proof ... and I don't think that is even just crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know ... Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that\nIn the Internet age devil's triangle now means this thing is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about this drinking game Nathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that\n... yeah I mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this thing of the proceeds Brett Kavanaugh's testimony you know I'm happy to discuss it I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and\nThe most major lives are much much much more significant ah like saying I never attended a gathering with the people forward says now on his ...\nAttended a gathering with the people that Ford says he attended a gathering with when he says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen in fact one of the ... and he's he cited he's at Ford's friend Leyland Kaiser\nSays that this didn't happen that's not what Leyland Kaiser says Leyland Kaiser says she believed Dr Ford which means it did happen it will say you misrepresented actually it would be all\nEnd if she believed belief does not mean that it did happen just to\nBe well she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that strangely it didn't happen she believes that it happened right her opinion is that forward is telling the truth\nRight not but it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says what they say it didn't happen that falls that's a false statement as a full representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's false he did we know from his calendar\nOkay so ... and like I'm going to come back to you for a second on this but I just want to play these two moments that Nathan is referring to first of all here is Brett Kavanaugh again before the Senate Judiciary committee last week uh in fact in his opening statement saying the calendar that he kept in high school a\nShow that he he says that he never attended a gathering with people that are professor Ford named\nNone of those gatherings record of a group of people that Dr Ford as far as my calendar show I was very precise about lifting was they're very precise\nAnd then in an exchange with democratic Senator Chris Coons a judge Kavanaugh asserted that uh the witnesses who attended the party that professor Ford said the assault happened that they have submitted statements are saying that it didn't happen and here's what judge Kavanaugh said\nI just want to emphasize all four witnesses who were allegedly\nAt the event of said it didn't happen\nNow on like a green I'm actually we know that what the statements the statements that the witnesses submitted say that they have no recollection\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words again we're not looking at the past but what he said\nContemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should sort of on the United States Supreme court and we're joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my ... she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real\nClear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is in an exchange with\nUh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator Amy ... a Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I Know I remember what happened\nAnd I think you're probably a dear sir and\nSo you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIf you're asking about the blackout I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course people remember just having a after a break came back and apologize to senator ...\nAnd agreeing to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the weekly standards pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that quote even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore\n... ... what's your response to that\nThe fact that he apologized to fire Clovis churches that he felt that he had come across as too aggressive that I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because\nI have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process this is you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she did this but I found to be a very loudly reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human 'cause really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kind of damned if he does and damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech to make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which he was the last person who's going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in or just\nSeems you know on careful or as Nathan Robin said Katie\nOr that if he is ... and just and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened\nAnd the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen\nWhich is the political way of saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so\nI think it's important to remember is a human I think this moment showed that he was human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice Nathan your take\nWell what unethical colloquial I call false right just just misrepresenting the facts that but I I say cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like I'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says\nI was number one in my class in high school well that that's not an answer to the question right and and the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character by accusing him of drinking it's directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's why it's so important for him to be honest and to answer those questions directly\nNobody's going to hold it against him if he says look\nI I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the ... club like uh because I I drank a lot and you know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates of your time so to a dozen of his classmates who all say\nThat he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college\nUm and and and as I say that they say that directly with his freshman year roommate who said he was a belligerent drunks\nUm we have the uh ... University of Washington I'm headed the gun culture you know on college in apartment who says I used to drink with Brett\n... it's not credible she said it is not credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes is different from how he remembered ah the night before that is what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who are participating with him all watched him all say that's just not credible he he he ... his high school yearbook he's part of the city club that tried to get through a hundred K. eggs in a year\nYou know in March judges memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart Kavanaugh who feel ... everywhere\nUm and he wouldn't even admit that he was bought Kavanaugh um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will that falls you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that is also in the book\nLet's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on your knees and\nI thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I did a great Kavanaugh was lying and I wanted to say so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted\nThe allegations about and when that wasn't true\nI also talk to the claim that there was a Clinton revenge stream going on as over the top accusations but I don't think the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not or it can be sure he led regardless of if you will your doctor for it or not\nI don't think that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lie to Congress back when he was getting a lot of attention from act turns and none of the Republicans are cared about it or wanted to\nAnd then I don't think they're doing now and measuring the group of people supporting him and all I followed it very ironic because they have to freeze stand with Kavanaugh because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker and my experience was that sort of political slogan used to cover up on trust\nSupport for WPRI comes from the Sparta area chamber of commerce with spiders fall fast Saturday October thirteenth information about bike trails canoeing and shopping in the historic downtown is at ... dot com\nBust Walker and like that's probably not trustworthy so when you actually have the same thing that was it was like oh my gosh oh\nNathan thank you for your call and if a green let me turn back to you I think Nathan is broader point is that he doesn't feel that no matter you know whether that ... that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that to judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but\nIn ... he sees a whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress at all or congressional Republicans and they're going to\nA they're going to confirm him anyway and uh he he objects to the ... what's your response to Nathan\nWell actually what nation is saying is that he sees a line of lives and that's much stronger than misstatements I mean I I as a more trying to see this more objectively I say well maybe he did make misstatements\nUm I don't think that the for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink and high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he said in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd in his calendar you know you look at a statement like oh well they said that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described there is no gathering that says that leave when Carter was there who also said I don't know him I didn't go to parties with him Dr Ford clearly described a different type of gathering et cetera\nBut like we are talking about what is the use of going through things that can't be proven from years ago\nAnd I think we even saw this um and and that was last Republicans were trying to sift through this and said we need to hear from people who are coming forward with these allegations\nHow do we start to do this because it was going to live with the political circus so they got a prosecutor who has experienced in bringing forth cases of sex crimes she came out with a report which I didn't see mentioned\nUh in in Nathan's piece at all or where she said I found this weaker than a he said she said case based on inconsistencies in her testimony so I think it's important to be fair saying look\nYou can find inconsistencies like people are human they're talking about things for the best of their recollection and when you're being questioned in front of every chairman of the nation of before a panel senators whether your Christine forward or Iraq having all that is an intimidating\nBooks of readers Wisconsin find out more about Wisconsin book festival dot

law\nAnd jak McCarthy is with us he's in Tempe, Arizona he's a Twenty one ... year old senior at Arizona State university and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk we want to know what you think about college drinking culture\nNow a and again as we talked about before\nBefore the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings from regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if you're in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you were at\nEight hundred forty three eight to five five as I said and we've got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website\nAh for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town my residence is surrounded by college housing Thursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students carrying racks of course in the next party\nA until the cultural privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed the shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva\nAnd William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research at high risk alcohol consumption in college students\nFor three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Leslie Perkins welcome to you\nThank you very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us from what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this this story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus drinking culture now ... are we at a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think what what I was hearing from them is not something uncommon that you will hear students or\nA or even graduate says they reflect back I have to say [noise] um we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were\nEven going back Thirty years ago if I might say a quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campuses based on a scores and scores of studies the over arching an irrefutable\nFindings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking\nIt is significant and sometimes quite tribes and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're out their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old and those as compared to any other age population and compared to non college\nYoung adults are the same age ... this is the heart of the of the problem\nIs when we talk about alcohol abuse and high risk\nThose levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains\nHaving said that even given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college it is not now nor has ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students\nThe best measures of a of of of high risk drinking are about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally in high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent\nMight be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers\nAnd it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students\nConsumed two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched one quarter of students are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that consume so the high risk drinking\nIs relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious problem can I some significant\n... yeah so if it was a person is just one quick point of clarification hum maybe said it but I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that well uh\nSometimes today with the word a binge drinking issues and typically what is used most commonly an measures are measures such as using\nFive or more drinks at a setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences more recent decades that we've had better measures that focus on you used to talking about drinking five or four more in a two hour period because\nAt a sitting sometimes for college students might mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nUh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol levels up\nTo a high risk level such as a point oh eight which was the I'm a legal limit a in terms of driving\nWhen a ... one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas\nAnd that's a so if we're talking about drinking a five or more in a two hour period without intention has some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about\n... says okay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yeah so what I think is interesting\nAbout what the difference may potentially be if we are going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades is that\nThere does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I've spoken to my parents are people from previous generations seems to be different it seemed people seemed shock that there are just handles of a car or whatever it's easiest to get a hold of\nEasily available said like basically right off of that year freshman year\nAnd I don't know maybe ... or jak find that to be somewhere experience their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[noise] yeah um I think they're probably a ... D fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking hard alcohol or beer on depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for 'em ... before football game tended to be more beer\nGear heady whereas party hosted a fraternity and eat for ... you know whatever that tended to be more um hard liquor centric so I think that's definitely a a notable point okay and Jack\n[noise] um I Would definitely agree with ... like if you're going to a tailgate or something it's definitely going to be beer heavy but\nI think definitely for house parties and certain things like that are hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carry your carrying around a thirty case of beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient than just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends okay well we Perkins\nI mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that same trend\nRight well I think it is true that are depending on the particular context you might see more beer being consumed or [noise] or more hard liquor [noise]\nBut the the fact of the matter is that uh we could go back decades and find a a punch in grain alcohol being poured for big parties uh that were quite common in certain circumstances\nBack in the Nineteen seventies eighties and so forth [noise] um and uh still nationwide beers a drink of choice although uh uh in some sectors and some schools\nAre some hard liquor may have in increased popularity\nBut it's when we use the word trends of uh we're just not seeing major trends without regard [noise] um and the bottom line still is how many drinks you're consuming how quickly and if you haven't been eating at all [noise] uh you know it can enter your bloodstream pretty quickly no matter what type of alcohol you're consuming certainly\nOf heart alcohol can can in your bloodstream very quickly if you're doing\nTen shots in a row and that sort of thing but if you are trying to drink as many beers as you can in a row that can be equally um a devastating too so [noise]\nUh I think we have to temper the the notion that oh it's just hard liquor is it's a new phenomena and and it explains all the problem is it's a mixed\n... just a we have so many college when I joined us callers I promise I'm going to get to you but I Want to ask was ... one more question here because you know look I I get it there maybe some people listening to this saying why all the shock\nI mean you you just made me you sound like you know a a a shock teetotaler who's saying oh my God there's so much drinking on college campuses\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

senior at Boston College Brianna Picard joined us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she is the first year law student\nAt the George Washington University School of law jak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges he's been conducting research\nOn high risk alcohol consumption for several decades where at one eight hundred for two three eighty five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about three to eat\nAnd the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find it's shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magnum\nSo that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this\nDo you hear first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nThat's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself now insofar as me being shock to the students who are under Twenty one hundred drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just\nLet me just talk to Madeline and ... and Jack here I mean respond to what's what Stevens saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you is it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people are used to relieve stress because I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major ways to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress to grow with your friends and have a couple of drinks like brown was saying you got on Thursdays there'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks [laughter]\nThere's there's not like people are going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight and give us some more of like you just\nCut yourself off because you go to a party and there's like there's all call there and you start drinking and drinking and then you walk out but there's a million different ways relieve stress the button you know it's not a common one I Would say\nOK so Brianna against Steven ... says ah why do you find a shocking to hear that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak there are a million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a how ... that he can go for a run or you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for a school or work or other things that are laying down on you know\nI'm or ultra light jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class and he'd grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and then you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to\nDrink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of the show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think\nLike professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time um at least not now in law school an undergrad one needy your responsibilities weren't as much as they are earning now um you might go out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that\nBut certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to drive different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing\nBecause at least in my license blackout is kind of used almost colloquially like you you were like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nFor ... like as to what the comment on mine said [noise]\nI don't like I don't know that\nWe are all blackout every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language now in a way that it might not have been before All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the erotica\nHi thank you for taking my call um I get from here I already graduated from college and hearing all and the drinking the ... crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street and that kind of like dry party scene of the nation\nPeople are a little I mean she ate truthfully about really go out and drinking and it almost sounds like it that choice\nTo go out when I've seen people blackout it 'cause I think and they like they do that on purpose they get to a point where they can't control that drinking anymore so I guess my question would be do you think that it always up when I got a blackout or not it didn't or that\nYou get to the point where you just can't control and that's when like things with what\nWe can with Josh common I I happening and maybe people like oh maybe I can remember or maybe they just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like\nI don't know it's just like lying basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the cake and everything like that had to be a blackout and from what your guests\nAre they speaking it's like crop rating that if you can't control that you're going to get to that point right I'm\nVeronica thank you for your call jak cutting my turn to you on that or I mean you heard the question what do you say\nUm I definitely say for the blackouts especially I think\nWe're missing the point to that some people out there they have like bigger issues that nobody knows about so that sometimes they do go out to drink and like kind of forget about their problems and I think that's also like another reason people are blocking out up there because they have issues that you don't exactly know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out of the bars\nThey have other issues and the the um massing seem alcohol because they are trying to cover up those ... ... what what's your response to that question\nWell I think that if it if you start from they are going to a party are going to a ... point of view first of all of that is only as a segment of the population but you observe the people who are the most extreme and you go home and or talk with your friends and have stories about\nUh the person who passed out on the dance floor or who started a fight or who uh got sick or had to clean them up and that sort of thing [noise]\nAnd uh we have millions of who are stories about them it can be funny it can be sad it can be scary I ... and so forth but we talk about is what most of the talk is about\nAnd understandably these studies are situations of concern in many instances but when we talk about them so much and we have thousands of words for being intoxicated been only two or three for not being intoxicated moderation being sober at an abstinence\nBut you can think of thousands of words for being drunk\nThat reflects the talk and so consequently it tends to normalize in people's perceptions that this blackout culture as we are talking about are describing it is something that is the norm and it's accepted it's not a big deal but in fact\nThe blackout behavior which can lead to a very serious consequences particularly in terms of of a sexual assault or our\nOur our ... serious problems over there but the it's it's legitimate as a segment of the population but so many people don't speak out about it or against it because they think well it is enormous what most college students to read it it's the same phenomena of of ah students saying\nWell most students do this but not me that is a very common pattern and because we just don't talk about the majority who are normal and it's not just from survey research we can demonstrate this we demonstrate this with anonymous B. C. testing on campuses campuses around the country who have done this and shown that\nThere may be twenty percent coming home late night with a intoxicated and the rest are coming home and not having consumed alcohol or had a consumed very little so it's it's the the biological evidence in Missouri ovens is overwhelming but it's still a serious\nSupport for WPRI comes from the Sparta area chamber of commerce with Spartacus fall fest Saturday October thirteenth information about bike trails canoeing and shopping in the historic downtown is at ... dot com", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Madison", "day": "04"}
