V. E. okay\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives you know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is on track illegal immigration\nThat's ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. V. okay in Kentucky a chest yesterday well joining us now is Ellen ... he's joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on point radio dot org as well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program thanks for having me\nAll right so you just heard that Paul Ryan and they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is this route issue unchecked illegal immigration and you know today it this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets are about to immigration specifically so how's central is this\nAs an issue to Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue um it's it's I think it started\nFrom Trump um he obviously this is something that worked for him in twenty sixteen I'm it wrote into the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he was talking about Mexicans and\nWhich Mexicans are coming into the country and all that and he wrote that through to the White House and so for him he's just taking a page out of his twenty six themed political playbook\nAnd applying it to this mid term um and it's and it seems like something that just kind of struck him just a few weeks ago because it was really the care of and that really started all them since October sixteenth um is really really started to you know they get in on this such has been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America threatened to tear up the new NAFTA deal threaten the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at the ... at this point and it's still about nine hundred miles away [noise] um so he started it but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embraced it um and they've been arguing\nThe same tax they've been taking the same tax\nUh for for weeks now and you see it and Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um it's not the defining issue of their campaign\nAnd how much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and health care last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing about immigration I'm with Republicans talking about it on the campaign trail\nWell this has been the fascinating thing to see if you poll all Americans um\nNumber one is health care and number two jobs and the economy a gun policy is number three\nImmigration is fourth and this according to a Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolated out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue ... them so clearly it's working for the target audience a tear intending to um you know immigration is round up the ... one of the things that really riled up his base and twenty sixteen\nAnd so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about right\nWhen it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that\nThis is an attempt and this is a way to rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no working on the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this is strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... in ... there turned out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist here because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes Democratic Party because it's so simple we have illegal and legal ... migration and president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years we've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it\nAnd it just seems kind of crazy me while I don't think the big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that the obviously wants to change birthright citizenship which should not be such a contentious thing I mean I'm a pro immigration guy I'm just a pro legal immigration Democrat\nI Believe in immigration and then but I Do think health care is much higher priority for me and what I Do and I think that\nThe Democrats and Republicans both want to make changes but there's so many entrenched interests it's virtually impossible and I think each one claims each other and nothing gets done yeah things that do get on or not productive\nWell Jay thank you so much for your call Ellen ... let me turn back to you on that because one thing that Jay's comment makes me think of is Republicans are pushing hard on these immigration issues I mean ... advertising in debate on the campaign trail in interviews\nAre ... are Democrats responding or they just simply ... trying to ignore immigration is an issue and focusing exclusively on health care and does that put them at a slight weakness when it comes to dealing with as you said at least in Republican mind the number one important issue for

with us from Miami and with us from El Paso Texas is ... ... he's immigration and border security reporter\nFor the Texas Tribune and we've got lots of listeners comment coming here here on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people in town and Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tones\nAnd then mark says the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I I just wanted to say that I Am totally in favor of the border\nThey care I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump does not want any violence down there but it's obvious that\nThe people are getting aid somewhere they have water bottles they have they have money [noise] something is sponsoring this and we need to protect America and also not there no I Believe in voter ID I hadn't even get once you get a library card\nI have to have identification alone to open a credit card to get a library card just starting to kill it is there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it why can't they have id to vote\nWill Lorrie thank you so much for your call their uh Alan Gomez I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who is immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concern the issues are concerned about [noise]\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned zero due to one by one said that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about this curb it\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these caravans are like I mean first off they're coming into the ... they're they're they travel encourage ranch for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America and Mexico is a very dangerous and never\nUm so they for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely them and the last ... curve and that got here then provides a little bit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border\nUm about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them did exactly what they said they they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um and and for more reporters a we have embedded with the Caribbean moving through Mexico\nSupport for WPRI comes from visit we know now with an assortment of entertainment options like Shakespeare bike trails bluegrass a trip planner and events calendar is available at explore Minnesota tourism and visit when ... dot com\n... it's going to take a long time and by the time they get here it's going to be for fewer people and not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or seek over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm In a little early in the show and then just clarify here that are in the ... also seeking to some merely deny asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat is a ... the ... the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh mid ... they were planning to Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the Pittsburgh shooting in in some of the other\nTragedies we've seen recently um but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale that they use to implement the travel ban\nShortly after Trump took office\nIt was the first two versions of the travel ban worship down to the courts but the third one survived and so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one and trying to apply somewhat similar argument to what's going on along the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nAnd the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second is in when he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could grow out here\nRight now who in ... oh you know you're there in El Paso when I was I mean if you could talk to us about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one uh ... between ... representatives\nA Republican we'll hard and Gina Ortiz Jones or his Democratic challenger right because they did that district that heard represents has many hundreds of miles up on the border\n[noise] correct It's got about eight hundred miles of the of the Texas Mexico border and it stretches from a far east Paso county [noise]\nUh all the way to uh to the outskirts of ... county which is includes San Antonio and big band and several border counties in between the you know this this this was considered a closer it's a few months ago but the latest polling shows that um\nComics for her it is I guess he's a little bit more comfortable if I have to say that then is um or taste John doesn't pose a significant challenge\nAnd could still you know that that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back to twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving\nThe Democrats and the protects us a little bit of hope but I'm confident heard also it was very public about his is the way you stress for bipartisanship um you know she and and car shuttle Rourke actually they you know they did that\nFacebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they had to drive back to the sea and they they ended up doing the Pittsburgh live of their journey which I think when I'm pretty good way for\nFor both of the congressmen to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas they're concerned about the wall and eminent domain and issues like border security but they are also um by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they think it's an action you know you talked to [noise]\nTo ranchers all along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans are they have to call border patrol or people are going to their property and that's not to say they're not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work to escape\nYou know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman hurt in the minds of his constituents has done it\nMiddletown she's been somewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but close to lecture today he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more towards the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the extreme end and Mr Mr Gomez has point earlier with respect to the the caravan\nHe's absolutely right with respect and we don't know how many people are gonna end up coming here and what I saw on the bridge and she was on Tuesday was migrants there were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get process so with respect to the caller's concerns and legitimate concerns about who's coming into the country\nIf you're a violent criminal lawyers she can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're going to present at the port of entry when he was a lot of people are definitely doing\nYou know the the herd Jones raises interesting to me because uh will hurt has been I think he he represents as ... as you were saying earlier how um the views of communities on the border I'm much more they're more subtle and textured\nA than we might see a ... as we get further and further away actually from from the border because I Know hurt has been a very eloquent I'm advocating for more smart ... technology versus hard wall a technology between the United states and Mexico but we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Alan\n... thanks for taking the call um I think this is just another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense um and to play defense against emotional appeals to stay focused on this rational discussion\nUm I think there's a lot of winning points that the Democrats have and I think they do work brings some of them out surveys show that the American public favors a permanent status for the dreamers some sort of permanent status\nAnd I think the Democrats can make the point that immigration is a problem with immigration and be solved immigration reform rather than through posting troops on the border\nAllen thank you for your call I'm Alan Gomez let me turn to you it is that what you're hearing from Democrats are we just hearing more ... or softer tone\nI mean I think it's interesting there do they use the word emotional and when it comes to the Democratic response because\nIt ... it to some degree ... there is there's quite a bit of fear for the ... over the summer of what this abolish ice movement that that only a very small

I'm In great detail but we do get to know so much about them and their culture through what they wear I mean did you see the costuming for the film as central to the storytelling as\nYou know as we watched it and I've seen you know\nLay and the costumes gave us an opportunity to delve into specific parts of the African tribal culture as well as to bring so much color and vibrancy to the film a\nThere's a lot of scenes that take place in ... real expansive environment and we were able to color that environment with the suit to blankets and the beautiful red Maffei color for the door I'm Alive Shay and you know it just was a feast of color\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

on and she's talking with us this hour from Savannah Georgia and you can join us we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred\nFor two three talk what is your question for America's most\nUm when I was a younger ah say junior high school and through high school my mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker was a free counseling service for the city and\nPeople could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew people you know um there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and\nSo we would ride with her through um you know downtown or down go to ... she'd drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh in\nI'm In the back seat and my mom would say you know he looks okay he's gotta clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause and it's kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know some time she would even role that window down to our dismay and say you know how ... how George you know how are you today and you know that kind of a view of\nYou know people is what I still used today to kind of embrace a individuality\nAnd that it\nHelps with embracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all and\nYeah you know 'cause some occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly occurred you know there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the world of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film\nThat's essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story a and so now they want to communicate that to the world constructed in that film and then to us as viewers\nYes I feel that costume design or can be just to find his story telling design and you when people want to associate costume design with fashion\nAnd you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but\nThe overall a I'm a goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear\nRight so so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm In Hollywood I mean well just let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done one Fifteen plus collaborations with him and\nYes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter] um I met Spike Lee in Los\nAngeles a friend who's a casting director now Robbie read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for\nAnd it in the lobby I was\nShowing my portfolio to one of my friends and I I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all\nYou know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so I kept you know modeling around him I have this idea of getting film experience and he suggested\nThat I call USC or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student these projects and he said that would give me experience with being on a set\nAnd what that medium um would be like and so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was on the U.S see students ... are doing the costumes are\nWell and then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right thing so I Want to play a clip well not all day I was actually the first one and then do the right than to say OK I wouldn't be sure to Spike Lee fans out there like get your fill longer iffy right leg\nThe right thing it's such an amazing movies to this day so I just want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is a scene where you're going to hear a John John ... who plays bugging out and he asked so the owner of the local pizzeria played by Danny halo\nOr why they're only pictures of white celebrities on the wall of his pizza shop\nOwners on the wall Street Journal which which one would\nGet a bunch of brothers an awful and nieces and nephews your stepfather stepmother who wants to see what this is my this American as high as on the wall you also for [noise]\nYou know what might be fine so what do you have to watch the anti American I ... off of your book so since we fed as much money we do have\nA scene from Spike Lee is Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer uh on that one of many collaborations she had with Spike Lee and the thing about this film a ruse if I may say is that it really\nOne of many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality of what the characters are wearing like a high top the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how does that play out in your design\nWell it was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a\nUh clothing or during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and we really wanted to represent you know pop culture of a moment and\nReally create this um this intensity of color in their environment\nAnd so what we did was we created like top side of African fabrics\nAnd you see bugging out wearing can take cloth shorts that we made and\nIt was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really had that stuff would go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and\nSo because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of color and\nAnd the styles that um we present to kind of all the fed into the combination of what eventually happened story\nWell uh we've got a lot of callers who want to ask you some questions right so if you turn to them to be a delight we were talking it through the card or she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer uh she got those nominations for Malcolm X and um it started but those are two of the forty plus films that she's been a costume designer on\nThen that means we double checked [laughter] and I'm wanting more TV project I your group and again congratulations to you

designer she got those nuts for Malcolm X and ... and her most recent work you've seen it it's in Black Panther she's also done the costume design for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what's love got to do with it and Selma as well and I wanted to just play a quick clip\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of Reverend Dr Martin Luther king in ... twenty four teen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and fuel striped tie and a styling black overcooked\nDon't want to [noise]\nCost don't want to [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nIt was found in\nShopping\n\nSeems from the two thousand fourteen film Selma Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you were doing a film a depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who's playing Dr King\nWell there are a several images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king there's several books pictorial books that had been written and\nSo the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one uh is that I'm a Martin Luther king was a real busts men and\nIf you look at him and his suit you notice that you know there's a little flashy area around the color of his neck where he button down shirt and it would kind of roll over the top\nAnd David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is gained weight for the role um and I wanted to sort of\nHelp that along and I made his a shirt Powell is so tightly smaller than would we what would be required so that I can also see that little neck role that happened I'm at the color of king\nShirt I Love that detail [laughter] I don't think I Would have ever noticed but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying a character yeah and the costume has\nTo support the actor there has to help support their performance and I'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction of the colors during that time\nNow to David every day the shirt colors were too tight um\nHe never complained and I would say he never complained um maybe it just felt right right for him and uh when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one hundred forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk call us with your questions for ... the Carter and how she tells he's African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\nI'm not an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about this when I saw Black Panther in the theater I was just\nBlown away not only by the film but also by its potential as a teaching opportunity I met future who's been working on a project on how we can use\nTextiles and clothing to teach science technology engineering and math topics and I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate here\nOf opportunities we can't we don't just send you know right now just sense to you know being a robotics team or something like that\nBut they could learn three D. print things\nThey could talk about textiles with special technology in them like the black Panthers suit stores kinetic energy well what kinds of other energy could you put into a fabric how would you do it they're just so many opportunities here and it was so exciting\nThere and thank you for your cold Ruthie of a response for\nUm what I Love about series lab is that it's a a it's an exploration and what kids can do you never can hunters estimate what

couple of minutes about ... in particular one of the films that you received an Oscar nomination for for your costume design there of course that's the Steven Spielberg film\nI'm about uh about a revolt honestly on a Spanish slave ship and so we have a scene here\nAgain the films Nineteen Ninety seven and you're going to hear the leader of the slave revolt Josephine Cape played by the gym on a whim sue who stands up\nUh during the mutiny trial he's put on trial for his labor of old and repeatedly cries for his freedom\nFor for the front of a kind of disrupt these proceedings without jobs\n\n[noise]\nCrying all or\n\nA scene from the Nineteen Ninety seven film I'm is not that scene where the leader of the slave revolt justice in case put on trial Carter if I remember correctly in that scene a sink is wearing a western coast right\nYes ah the abolitionist\nI and the reading we read that the abolitionist gave a clothing to the Africans and there was an account that said in the courtroom they look like dogs sitting in the gallery and so I use those words to create um\nClothing that was donated especially forcing K who would have been given closing from\nThe attorneys that were supporting the case and\nI also wanted to present him in a royal manner um very regal at this moment where he says give us free\nAnd you'll notice that um the African sitting there and the gallery or mostly in these white bill Lewis shirts up the period and I wanted to evoke the feeling of a\nHot now is it also us maybe I was reading this wrong because I I I thought that part of the reason why\nThe slightly baggy fit uh on on Joseph was as you said like he had to wear borrowed close um and that's a so that they didn't quite fit properly but nevertheless gave as you're saying there's this regal field him\nYes yes and I was assured of the parent period was very below we pleaded ruffled shirt yeah\nAnd and this is a particularly interesting film to talk about because I'm ... and you also did the costume design for white royalty on the fill up\nUm yes John Adams yeah and you know based on you know art history I looked at the composition of some of the great painters and\nAlso the history of the court case of the ... and all those things are important to paint that picture of royalty and the African says you know when they first embark in Mystic Connecticut",
