investigation into the nine eleven attacks he's been watching Saudi Arabia for almost Twenty years now and he's saying that it's time for Washington to really stop coddling\nThe Saudi kingdom where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five by the eight hundred and forty three talk a Senator Graham I Hope you can forgive me that I had to cut you off there before the break because um\nYou're telling us it's very interesting story about a Saudi couple a young Saudi couple in Sarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now if I if I'm reading the recording around this correctly\nThat they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers\nUh and his license plate information was were on file 'em in the office of this gated community indicated it maybe he'd been coming in and out and then later on the FBI temple office had actually compiled of lay the reporter the with\nConnections between the hijackers and his family but with the FBI give you that report\nNo uh and after attempting to get access to the report we uh\nWe which was a journalist and myself a ... ... ... filed a freedom of Information Act\nOr to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have any information on the three of flight students are and the Saudi family or the judge rejected that as being a on\nBelievable or they even said that uh they uh had a a few documents a man and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily uh directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages of information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven\nSurvey of the situation in Sarasota\nOf with the judge them to determine what which of those ... eighty thousand pages could be made public\nA it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen or and after six years the judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand\nPages of can be made available to the American public okay\nSenator name I Want us take a step back here though because ... you're right to those ... eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of a Florida federal judge eighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota\nNot yet made available to the public in any way shape or form but even before or the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the those pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask for some of the reports at least um\nCentral record keeping all of this team and see some of some of these reports and that uh and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nOh I Would say the FBI was being quite a on a cooperative in fact I'm at one point shortly after the situation in Sarasota was discovered uh\nMy wife and I were a in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with our second daughter third daughter ah and ah we were intercepted at a\nLogan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there are an essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI or that we're wasting our time and that I\nShould uh shut up and go oh you were the ... the hair of\nThe nine eleven commission and the and the number two person at the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow elite about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers I mean it it almost ... belief that as\nWell and it gets it gets worse uh so I uh I said I told the deputy director of the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so I did uh and uh\nThe when I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have a had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again I was wasting my time uh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI on the Sarasota a ... situation\nCenter [noise]\nNine eleven [noise] you know we were Seventeen years out and\nAnybody who was alive and remember that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and and I'm hearing you tell me that the FBI as late as two thousand eleven was actively trying to dissuade you from\nA you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and ... and you said before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within its possession information it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening\nWell uh the mystery is a over three administrations why has there been this up\nA reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they wanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nUh raised the possibility that another nation state uh was responsible ran counter to that narrative uh the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had run in two thousand eight in large part on his opposition to the war in Iraq and\nHad raised questions about the about Saudi Arabia and why it was a more a focus of attention but uh in\nAdministration or to expedite the release of information on nine eleven and now a President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darling of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president or has been very Folsom in his ah statements of\nApproval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no uh\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven\nYeah and I'm going to take a couple of quick call here senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official reports so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this not um that no one no official report saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean would you go so far as to say that you have seen\nAgain in your time is co chair as nine eleven a commissioner that you've seen evidence or documentation or something anything that ties the Saudi royal family itself to something like nine eleven\nYes I mean I think the twenty eight pages you've already cited the\nOne situation where prince band or who is the ambassador Saudi Arabia to the United states or was involved in financing a persons who played a critical role in uh nine eleven

now from Dallas texas is Dr Benjamin Greenberg he's a professor in the department of neurology and your therapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern medical center\nIs also an expert in treating rare autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system and he's already treated eight patients with acute flash said ... ah my latest this year ... welcome to implant\nThank you might not happy to be here so first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to science we've seen it before\nYou're correct and the the facts are also we are a part of the issue relative to some confusion so\nWhen we talk about acute ... it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults\nAre there are multiple ways to damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen\nEvery other year in the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with\nThis type of a condition of ... and the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that that's an ... virus\nIt is that's the suspicion or the ... viruses are a group of viruses that are very common uh usually cause either respiratory\nA illnesses that are usually quite mild ah most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an honor of ours and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold\nAnd then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous\nAs I see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing these I'm quite worrying headlines about polio like symptoms\nOr in some children who are being infected with this and you say that um we started started seeing a spike beginning in in two thousand four teams so uh but the ... virus wasn't wasn't meeting these same symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated acute ... patients\nAnd when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference\nBetween two thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognized and\nThat the symptoms of syndrome a looks essentially like polio ... which\nWas described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about the polio virus as the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine\nMhm once we essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states\nThe syndrome of polio ... which look almost identical or with a few unique features between them\nThe polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but we think are there have been a background of rare\nParalytic events mainland kids happening for several decades but something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand two thousand fourteen\nAnd so that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nHow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern\nWhere we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes a for these ah outbreaks in the late summer early fall and what's notable is the the virus that has received the most attention\nUm which is within the family of inner of viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus in any of these cases when testing has been done\nIn a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay this is where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I said earlier that\nThese enter the viruses are also very common and ... and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but it but if they're still kind of I don't know that there's no current vaccine for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there\nA correct there is no are available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay um are we are just wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path and developing one\nIt is a very active\nAnd where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation so that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine we're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for\nAnd so we're our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus among researchers in public health officials that we think we have the right culprit and\nIt turns out that ah the virus or family viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy and so often will have children who have the syndrome of ... negative\nBased on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for\nBut it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um when we would test the spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating in their spinal cord and causing damage and affecting the nerves that control the muscles\nWe can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus or to find\nAnd so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so if you have a child with paralysis and you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus\nWe don't look to the final quarter the spinal fluid because we can't find that we have to look elsewhere in the body\nAnd so we're trying to sort out the same process a use for the center of ours is now the the reassuring part of this\nRelative to the history of polio virus is in the world of polio virus back in the Nineteen thirties and Nineteen forties when we had tens of thousands of children being paralyzed by this virus\nWas that for every hundred to every thousand people who would get infected with this virus somebody would become paralyzed and so it's it's virulence its ability to invade and damage the spinal cord was quite high\nThe best estimates for the enter a virus that we're most concerned about is that it's maybe one in a hundred thousand infection\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of

Packard right Packard and then ... and David Packard right they had a whole management theory about management by walking around they handed a profit share\nQuite a bit with their employees I mean it was it was the standard of an and look it would turn into a blue chip companies right no longer but [laughter] but it was at the top of the heap once the garage that ... that the bill and David founded H. P. and in the national landmark right\nAnd and the the one thing I I loved about it too they would have a big picnic for the whole company once a year and your families and and they view the company as a family and they\nThe two of them would serve all the hamburgers you know they would sort of certain people are sort of symbolic but but you know there's a certain humility to it and they wanted people to stay for their entire careers they bought\nLand for employees to go camping in or a you know for recreation in different parts of the world where they had officers\nThere were really much a very much about the people in their country then the next wave in the seventies and eighties you had this sort of counter cultural way we have like the jobs in Wozniak kind of thing and when I came into covering tech\nIn the late eighties it was still kind of hippy ... be counter cultural pro people who was a great place to work if you landed a job and one of these places like\nOh fantastic and that has radically changed and that's no longer you know [noise] that kind of place it's it's very stressful\nYeah we'll take it just comes up and you're saying 'cause we've got a caller who was who's talking exactly this about um the value of employees are in this day and age so let me just get his say here Robert is calling from Omaha Nebraska Robert you're on the air\nWell\nNo it was saying that the nine eleven employers ... an electric when you're a transactional issue can be turned on the news on but it's not the start and there's nothing there's nothing new or just returning back for\nThat real capitalism ... it's always brings our English or in a church\nRobert thank you so much for your call a ... ... what do you think about that means he's kind of thing when I said earlier that a lot of the sounds really familiar\nIt it it does in a way I'm ... ... I went back and thought I Want to read books by industrial ... of of a previous generation and see what they what they thought so I read Henry Ford's memoirs and read Thomas watching junior who was the c._e._o. of IBM\nSo it's not the rubber bands but and and Henry Ford\nObviously was not a nice guy yeah have you get to the very end of his memoirs him as a last shopping you're like oh my God whoa whoa whoa whoa but be before that part so\nIt's amazing he's saying I Am doing this to try to create as many jobs for his many human beings as I can and to treat them really well um he at one point how does that go around and try to find jobs that\nDisabled people could do because those people are pushed out of the workforce by me all the jobs you could do if you only had one on me all the jobs you could do if you were blind make a list and then we're going to go higher those people so they can work and they can ah they can make make a living yeah\nBut at this so this is the key difference though right that there was a time I'm for not for every company but for many companies the point was to grow the company and doing so involved in trying to be the best employer they could be\nBut ... you know sometime in the seventies and eighties we American Capitalism turned over to shareholder value creation that that was the ultimate goal of the company to serve the interests of shareholders\nSo when that ... and and I guess what I'm saying when I'm Wondering is it in your book are you writing that you think that that Silicon Valley because it's full\nOf somebody's billion dollar valued companies that may or may not be turning a profit that essentially they've put they put all the shareholder value creation on hyper ... that it it is by far the most important thing\nUm of anything that these companies can do and and that's the pernicious than it is that what you're saying okay\nIt's hyper capital and it it's you have Nineteen Seventy the turning point is Milton Friedman publishes famous essay about shareholder capitalism in every seat you know goes this is great all I have to do is return or money to investors time I owned compensation to the stock price and\nAnything I can do to make that happen is great got the pension fund you know usually all in involves hurting employees and so you had four stakeholders you had a customer's employees the community and investors and Milton Friedman just it will investors come first and now\nIts investors are the only ones who matter so you have companies in Silicon valley that have run for years have never made a profit don't treat their employees well deliver what they call MVP minimum viable product\nUm dodged taxes will get apple and Google hiding all this money offshore and not paying taxes 'em\nAll to benefit investors if companies were NBC's have become fabulously rich a founders had become fabulously rich but the company itself is not profitable again so happy to employees very well um so it's it's a really inside out kind of version of capitalism\nOkay well if this does get another call here we're speaking with dandelions he's author of lab rats how Silicon Valley may work miserable for the rest of us Marge is calling from Lebanon, Connecticut merger on the air\nThank you I Want to say that I worked for a large insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut for thirty six years my father also retired from this company he worked there for years all the time\nI was growing up I Do not remember him working overtime he was home at five o'clock for supper every day we had weekends to go away and so forth now they'll\nThey'll twelve years I worked in a wonderful unit I was able to accomplish every project they gave me on time or before a target date and they re arrange things five years before I retired I retired and four years ago but five years before I retired a reorganized and I became so\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I mean she everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right ... Amazon warehouses are not like that um ... when he mentioned I'm\nIn Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple of years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in this company\nAnd I'm trying to storm and I thought it like what do we come and even the BCS I call to that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise] anyway but yeah there are there is a lot of just hoping stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well anyway let me just ask you briefly a are we\n... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we\n... are we over waiting the influence of these like the old for big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's ... he was saying that he not obviously not every company is going this way it is are there actually maybe medium or a smaller size or come tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it in that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and you know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the better with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much\nBut at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and African right now it's just like a Hanukkah though because I mean because with knowledge work the asset is the worker right exact if not workers are not the liability whereas\nSort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor is that's\nThat's the lover that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down most quickly in order to\nA massage or profits were that quarter right just cut worth ... do you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets\nMy question is new to you India is that in trying to shift perspective a little here um for for these tech companies or for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowered them more of that that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nYeah I think it has to has to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and intention ... kind of the two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male chip as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps so they never raised any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or\nHow a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know have radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another an example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share it's a private company um but they share a all of their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they wanted to be able to build up more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they are the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there for\n'em and then I'd also say like a again to companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate in the success of that company as well so everyone is invested in this excessive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top um I think there's a lot to be said about having those\nMore flexible schedules and um you know enabling remote work I Know from my team a or just say multiple teams because they run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bulls and we plan those together for oh it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by this time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like says his long hit the world yeah hit the gold on how you you and your life\nNow now there are a lot more callers who want to get to hear but then one quick thought from you and what you're hearing from India\nOh you ... we we totally agree and and um [noise]\nThere's a a another company called Base Camp that are just in Chicago offer company and I I I'm I'm sort of detecting a few common threads with with the other companies that you're talking about any and and that is one Base Camp never took any PC\nTo they're not really obsessed with hyper growth are growing at an incredible rate they believe in slow growth they are profitable the charts\nThey have no interest in going public they want nothing to do with Wall Street and when I looked through", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city":
