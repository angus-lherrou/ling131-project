the Washington Post and of course our own news analyst shirt on point Jack Beatty up some and the president has talked a lot this week about the caravan of migrants wending its way about a thousand miles south of the U.S border in Central America south of even of Mexico at this point ah\n[noise] that that is certainly gotten a lot of news coverage and it's a very real issue on the other hand I'm In the president's framing of it as part of a a a a visual vital national security concern is it the sense that there is something that the president needs to address on a federal level or is there a sense of this and turning attention maternal actions I think\nThat that I think he wants to make the sense that there that the government needs to take action but it is important to point out the facts here that this caravan while it is traveling we've talked the latest an estimate from Mexican officials and that it is about more than nine hundred\nMiles south of the U.S Mexico border so it is still significantly far away um you know experts in the region and on the issue has said for a long time that these are people who are you know seek or who are fleeing from violence and terrible conditions in their home countries\nAnd trying to find refuge in the United states and that you know the vast majority of these or asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states\nUm I Do want to point out one use development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national ... um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block um you know people at the border who come here to seek asylum it's ... they're considering using kind of the same\nNational security rationale that they use to invoke the travel ban and the different iterations of the travel ban in the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final iteration of that band was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court\nAnd one option that the administration is now considering is doing that on the southern border um\nYou know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBut the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers can go on in addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the president become more I'm more focused on in these last several days and weeks\nDuring a bill or our listeners may or may not know that ... as well as reporting for\nThe star from Washington or you kind of bird dog the statements from the president for major officials are pretty much in real time in a rather extraordinary way I'm On Tuesday vice president Mike Pence bolstered the president's claim that there are unknown middle Easterners mixed in\nToward the U.S border here's what the vice president had to say\nThe United states of America intervenes and prevents him terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable that there would not be individuals or from the middle east as a part of this rowing the terror\nDaniel how accurate as the president and vice presidents remarks been in terms of characterizing what we know about that a caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in in like a logic class um you know he he a\nVice president Pence made his statement that is arguably factual isn't based on department of homeland security to test takes about\nPeople on terror walked those being prevented from entering the country and then made it completely unfounded link a leap from that to the care of and you know just because ten terrorists or suspected terrorists or let the terrorists are prevented from entering the country\nUm has no obvious a connection to people are trying to walk into the country\nFrom Honduras Guatemala\nAnd so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in the ministry shouldn't\nHave made logical leaves and completely baseless claims about this caravan that that have no grounding in ... in reality at all\n[noise] Jack Beatty is there nothing to the idea that that we should be concerned about the ... the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise a number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum we\nCertainly should be concerned about it but we should be concerned under the age of our laws which involve the right to seek asylum in the United states\nYou know what's going on here is the politics of fear of which Mr Trump is a master during the two thousand campaign he let it out is it real power is I don't want to use the word see here he's playing on fear\nA fear of the nation under attack by brown skinned people coming up from the south\nAnd reporters have talked to people as far north as Minnesota there was an interview with the times was a woman in Minnesota who said you know\nIf these people aren't stopped they're liable to come up here in Minnesota\nAnd to be going into the cabins that that people have is summer homes and end up staying there for the winter and then when the people who ... who come in the summer they'll do these these ah these migrants will be living in their cabins course they'd have to walk a thousand miles to support her and then the Fifteen hundred miles to\nTo uh to Minnesota but this this is what's here is the magnification of deep seated American anxieties especially among conservatives about keeping the country you know ...\nWe've got a call from El Paso Texas that John is calling us John my understand if you do some work down there that's related to this\nNew or they take my call we we work with a little militia down here we're mobilizing on the order to make sure that the caravan not make it into our country ... ... with what you eat when the media have been doing we're sick of your rhetoric at a press\nAnd we're not going to happen not going to share what we do advocate is it good discourse back and forth and and uh just disagreement a in a civil way but we're not we're not going to have people abusing each other on the air or we are going to return however to one of the comments that uh that I Want to follow up with Daniel Dale of Toronto Star\nA and think about the question she flagged questions about uh statements made by the president other members ... that he had been burned down because a lot of them weren't factual here's a a just Wednesday a couple of days ago\nFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci went on the air uh and she called president\nHe then went on Bloomberg TV yesterday to clarify that what he meant was that the president was an intentional ladder\nIs yes the president is speaking ms truth he asked the president is lying but he's doing it intentionally\nTo incite surfing people which would include left leaning journalist and most of the left leaning politicians and so what is happening is\nThey come out like a hall monitor and the elementary school or junior high school and they said oh wow the president's lying and his faith is basically laughing at 'em okay if someone's taking your lunch money in the cafeteria\nIf you call the hall monitor it's not going to help you okay you got to defeat the person at the table with your peer group\nSo Daniel Dale as ... a compares a sort of fact checkers people are doing real time ah verifying of information given to the public by their leaders home monitors\nA recently also a trolley or worse all of a a buzzfeed posts a piece where he says look depressed is participating in that cycle of a\nDisseminating miss truths or to the public even as doing fact checking here's what he says he says the cycle feeds itself simply by virtue of the media reporting on the president\nTrump lives at a rally or by tweeter press conference the press reports that he lies Trump tells his supporters the media's unjustly attacking him his supporters believe that news organizations dinner perpetuating and feeling Trump's claims simply by amplifying and checking\nHis statements what do you make of that\nThere are a lot of thoughts there um I I think the problem is actually the opposite I still think there was insufficient fact checking in truth telling you about the president's lies I don't think it has regularly the case that the media is is incessant is incessantly seizing on Trump's false statements at rallies or making a big deal about them in fueling\nA media hatred among Trump supporters I think many Trump supporters dislike the media for reasons entirely separate from the fact checking I think many of them are not reading are fact checking and I think the only alternative to\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing

on David Folkenflik we're exploring the opioid crisis this hour by talking to people most affected by it you can join the conversation what do you find works\nMedication assisted treatment abstinence only and twelve step programs where white hundred for two three eight to five five hundred forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string obituary for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon do pose the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a cheap composer you've called this one the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor NIH's that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have a department of health right where either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide it's the number one source of accidental death in our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with this little though it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine or the drugs\nThere are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges the human body for heroin and fentanyl are that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said you've been orphaned methadone there's a lot of stigma around um [noise]\nAssisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable another won't won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we can take a deep breath and we could move forward so\nAh what the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at\nOur needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment but you wanted to try some of the medication or you'll get a prescription for it and the prescriptions written by a doctor or a doctor who lost a son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose of sort of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a prescription for people who are ...\nAnd the Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot\nAnd we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place\nThat mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner or in our prison system who needs it and I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post incarcerate of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of that ... percent ... percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things are and hopefully it will turn the tide\nUm kitten O'Neill with this of helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean\nI Believe that would ... than incarcerated multiple times and never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think Burlington is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issue so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and Vermont again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue in a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an abstinence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm ... will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about some space which is another way of describing some of the things like twelve step you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean because in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to get them on a good path or it's it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know I'm Brennan just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family were not he was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking that the donor if you're taking to print our family you're not really create clean you're not sober right\nWhich is just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat\nThis disease and sell denying people access or making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you\nIf you have an issue ...\nPeople you know like you can't have this drought that would help you get at her and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's a stigma around that within the recovery community which I think his heart came\nOut I if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what Kate is saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we are headed\nFor unmitigated disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically if you look at that public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduce or the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town in Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict I used to play with his kids we used to go to social events together and when I started doing this line of work you said Brandon\nI've been on people who are in for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um if you just look at the success rates if anybody's spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there's no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality\nIs a losing proposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we'd give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life\nYou know we've been getting fascinating and stronger response from listeners or as as the show's been going on one a poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not she used to have either he posted on our website or she's on her Facebook page\nAnd and wrote addiction is a lifelong bite of a disease that fewer specter relies can't be cured by jail or combination only love respect understanding and radical forgiveness and patients can cure it or another comment on our website a under the name near as nine wrote I've had a cute chronic pain for over ten years opioids have kept me alive\nThey're the only reason I haven't killed myself do the endless horrible pain these drugs keep it at least at the level where I can read watch TV et cetera and get some website I've tried so many non drug treatments and non opioid drugs\nBut uh nothing or have helped I I Will point out that we do have a information on sites for dealing with addiction and also questions of dealing with a cell farmers suicidal thoughts on our website it on point\nA radio you can Google for that I Want to take a call now from Norwich, Connecticut\nAre now dear uh go ahead please\nOr height or okay thank you for having me on on the other guy the other gentleman just said this kind of threw me off because you cannot put somebody who

I mean there's ... there's ... or ... causes more than one way with people end up getting hooked on these things a lot of times I have is I'm I'm your accident a car accident and they're given a prescription\nThat affected them to come and go to the medication some people which either they don't need to take the medication and what we're paying some who do continue to either take the medication for my for my personal experience alone and you're a bit of knowledge I lost about nine people\nYou know gives right All right out of high school some of them you know one of the movie to see Thirty years old you know\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

latest book is titled ... dealers doctors and the drug company that addicted America I Want to start with a couple of calls that are kind of flooding in I'd like to take a call first from Gita are calling in from hartsville South Carolina thanks for joining us\nHi thank you for taking my call uh-huh\nI wanted to hear a little bit I I'm Sorry I just want to hear what your thoughts were about all this\nWell I'm I'm a recovering addict and I think an addict ever in here because I think we're now we're hard wired differently than normal you know or one travel at all and they get for somebody\nUm I went from I hated pain medicine and so I had um oral surgery and they gave me opiates and all of a sudden I was in a lot I thought this was happening I kidneys and then they gave me I think drugs um and and that was even better I was like God heaven and are\nYou know and then they turn English back out into the prescription and then that's it you know and then you're you're out there on your own with your body meaning for more of what can't yet and you'll do just about anything you can to get what you need\nMhm thank you for that change that we've also call from Boston, Massachusetts Tom you're on the air go ahead\nYou're doing okay I think the police chief from\nVermont is right on but I I got to tell you if the drug companies providing the medicated assisted medication we're pushing that drug as hot as\nPer do chemicals pushed the uh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem and because the medication is effect of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years\nAnd I've never seen anything like what I've seen over the last ...\nYou know the the pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back from the pharmaceuticals the front and all is a flooded throughout the addiction to heroin belt in Massachusetts anyway and so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people\nThat are stabilized on a on a medication\nAnd then what happens is that there are off and then they relapse die because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat day to get a shot up front and all of the they get the uh the uh her thirties that are that are really a crushed front and all and they got a couple of them and they guy now and my history I was incarcerated because of my opiates or ...\nAnd uh I relapsed that day I got out of that than read today I'd be the\nBecause of twenty percent of the population that erodes living proven that have a addictive um or heroin or histories died within the first ah two weeks because of an overdose so\nWe're talking with Tom let me let me what the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing both your personal experience and also your expertise on this but you don't want to let you weigh in on a couple of things first you heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how there are an active part of the solution constructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not\nA currently part of the problems or how does that fit in with your reporting on this [noise] well um\nSits in in that um you know they've just uh have plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make\nA difference in America they could do as chief don't pose a and others and some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose deaths rage by a very little bit\nAnd make it widely available one of the things I wanted to point out by what about the cheap and what's happening in Vermont\nIs that's really unusual I mean my hat is just off to him\nBut in states where are we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently\nI mean we have we have a talking forgive me you're talking about Medicaid expansion right yeah I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion I mean we have waiting lists that range from three weeks to two years to get into MIT programs we have no funneling some are ERs into MIT programs\nI'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange them nowhere for somebody\nMeant in our jails and um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live uh whether you get this lifesaving\nTreatment or not but we we have a a a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis reflection of American culture to seize of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans\nIn your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the constriction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in Appalachia\nA stretching from the you know the American\nSouth east up to the northeast a ... in industries where they could rely and steady jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distressed rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is it that ... was being pushed ... what we really need our policies to address the root causes which are mental health issues and\nSo ... socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers ask them in middle school when you want to be when he grows when you grow up\nAnd he says I Want to be a drawl or she goes oh you want to be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around him in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard it's hard to central at ... I Hope you always were prescribed three hundred six hundred percent that the\n... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nAnd recently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex is our said the U.S is starting to turn the corner on this epidemic or she cited figure showing a to point eight percent dip in over death from September twenty seventeenth of march twenty Eighteen according\nTo provisional data from the CDC the seemingly relentless trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be benefiting in the right direction plus telling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but\nThe concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn the tide\nBritain don't pose a you know the number of Americans dying from a ... a related deaths appears to be a just under the number of Americans in total who died in the Vietnam War but ... it's the secretary right are we turning the corner but on this\nWell first of all there that's every year rights of the Vietnam War was the ten year war and to you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so I think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for\nAmerica to fix it spiritual Malaysia before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we are being derelict in our duties and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders that want to wrestle with\nUnemployment and A People's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like Mary Weinberger here in Burlington or a a chief of police um you know get down to brass tacks there are things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and\nUh I'd like to think bad for being so candid about them as well I mean it's getting the right treatment out there it's getting medication to the people who need\nThe medication the Twenty one day apps and in space detox is called the spin dry by a lot of the people addicted to opioids in Vermont because you just go for your Twenty one day ... and what it does is it gets to the judge off your back and get your mom off your back\nAnd then you just go quietly back to your home and you start using opioids again that is not about hope and despair in America that's about sound public health policies\nThat can you just take\nWords just briefly what opioids due to the brain are they so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Madison", "day": "26"}
