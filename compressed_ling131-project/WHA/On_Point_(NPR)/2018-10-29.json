about Pittsburgh about the massacre that took place on Saturday a tree of life synagogue there and uh as about America is burgeoning ecosystem of hate and I'm borrowing that phrase from Jill Philips over to\nTweeted out about that a she's a writer and attorney over the weekend and my question is what to do about this broader ecosystem of hate that has been in bold and didn't even legitimize in America in twenty Eighteen we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk\nListen to how a president Donald Trump himself reacted to what happened in Pittsburgh during a Saturday evening rally in Murfreesboro Illinois the president began his speech addressing the shooting\nFish we could act of mass murder is pure evil [noise] hard to believe and frankly something is on a measurable\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday evening in Illinois I'm joined today by David ... he's executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette also by Howard find men he's NBC News analyst and journalism lecture at the University of Pennsylvania\nAnd joining us now is rabbi Daniel written birds she is a rabbi in residence at ... an organization that trains Jewish social justice leaders her opinion piece for the Washington Post is headlined the victims of the tree of life synagogue massacre are martyrs we have a link to that at one point radio dot org rabbi written Berg welcome to the program\nI magna so you're first thoughts today on um how how we should be looking at and thinking about what happened on Saturday a tree of life\nI we need to be seeing it in context um when Trump is saying this is so hard to believe and I think this is absolutely devastating a but it's absolutely conceivable get in the context of\nAnti Semitism historically and on the rise in America given the context of our lack of protections for gun violence\nGet in the context of ongoing tree thing hate crimes in America and the rise of white supremacy\nI'm this absolutely is\nA ... if it said that a lot of contacts and and get in the piece that it also sits in the context unfortunately of our history of of murders in Judaism\nMm I should note here that we've got a couple of comments who come in on line Nancy banks tells us on Facebook that while I Do not in any way wish to diminish the horror of the killings in Pittsburgh to black men were also murdered last week or possibly a hate crime a lot of heat for one week\nAnd in fact a genetics he's point that shooter was ... who had who couldn't gunned down those two black men in Kentucky said that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I'm trying to want to talk specifically about rising anti Semitism but also in the broader context\nEcosystem of hate here but a rabbi written bird tell me a little bit more about um ... you know how it is that we should look to or what exactly you see in American plead political leadership right now that maybe that maybe stoking all of this\nI there is a tremendous amount ... we have a a white supremacist administrative action and Trump has been in self attacking churches are us\nFor a long long time he's been using even after the tree of life shooting he's been making use of the global asked what she does very very often both of these are\nNew contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles at the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and an front and secretly ... you know funding infiltration is uh is is a very very very ancient idea um but it's it's manifesting\nNow in in a myriad of ways Mm\n[noise] well I mean Howard Simon let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um that the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA was really ranting and raving about online I mean ah you know he talked a lot about uh his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest right that that originally began and I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading\nOrganization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees talk and then there was a conspiracy behind that as well so hard just talk to me more about about how those threats come together\nWell ah this isn't a story just about the Jews are just about the tree of life a synagogue or where I basically grew up [noise] if you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the\nCoal mine of social and political disarray and and and and break down and and I think you need to look at it in that context of\nThe first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston were quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers on this case in a church\nI'm fed by a lot of the same\nParanoia and anger and and and\nConspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I look at it uh over the course of history ah conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a convenient and deadly\nA answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged and in an angry at the system uh it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years and here in America it as part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum or we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing a religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing\nWe're seeing politically motivated paranoia and and the language has gotten a harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the\nSome of the language that the the Democrats have used to\nHave have lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is or who is who is a political opponent\nWhat the point we've reached here\nAnd there are a lot of reasons for it there are lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically or is it subhuman is not quite human is is an other with a capital oh that is\nDangerous in in comprehensible and out to destroy society uh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system wanted contention but they relied on the idea that there would be character and the people that they were to be communities communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with him politically\nAnd and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing out\nOf our civic culture is what's allowed this to happen it's what's allowed\nOr the shooting in Charleston to happen it's it's what's allowed people to send pipe bombs to democratic leaders which is what led a Mr ... hours to uh to say I'm going in\nAnd and head into a a a building that I Know all too well where my parents both taught Sunday school where I was permits mood I'm In the scenes of mayhem there just to be on the magic but it it's all part of this larger context of the hollowing out of our civic life\nCan I can give that go ahead I'm [noise]\nI think this both sides rhetoric is not helpful in this moment and I think that's a out this gates the context in which a group of people have power and are stoking hate and our fostering humanizing language\nAnd are putting separating families putting children in cages creating Muslim bans removing a transgender ah folks access to to legal protection

we're talking about the massacre at Pittsburgh's tree of life\nSynagogue about America's rising broader ecosystem of hate and what to do about it and joined today by David Friedman Howard find men and rabbi Daniel written bird and rubber ... just before the break we had the color of shalom who was taking issue with some things that you had said and and I wanted to give you a chance to respond [noise]\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law ... son in law is ridiculous it's like saying\nThat he couldn't possibly be in a Sachin is because he's had three lives as somebody on Twitter rate the idea that that he somehow dissolved of his white supremacist stoking of his blaming the the caravan on Soros\nOf his constant attacks on source calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally um that he uses the word globalized again and again and again but somehow he's auto magically freed from from connection because of his daughters decisions if not resonate with me\nThe idea that George Soros is somehow this um you know it was involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked in stores themselves\nAddressed it in an interview it's not a fourteen year old in Hungary uh when the Nazis were there\nUm and yeah I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump mindset I Will say that I'm very clearly the Torah commands us\nAgain and again and again to protect the stranger who is among us the vulnerable and recommended thirty six times more than any other myths that in the Torah\nTo protect the stranger because we were ...\nNon citizen the immigrant among us and I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to ... to paint us as I'm\nHaving some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are are just part of a larger ... right\nYeah it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I I definitely will turn the ... but I also just wanted to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because\nI Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know I I I take the point that there are lots of bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront head on the east coast\nBirds end at least a [noise] I don't I don't know legitimize or not it's tamped down by a Republican leadership in America right now\nCan I speak to that because I've been covering them\nFor years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo no I uh to to to take it ... through the eyes of showroom if I can for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews overhead\nIs utterly wrong\nOr and here's the reason uh for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states or we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth and what's best in us to be not only present but but evident\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one has written out of the story\nOn the theory that they're not human and and what Donald Trump has done is that he has taken every thread of discord\nCynicism hatred and fear that has always been resident in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about\nThe Native Americans et cetera he's he's gathered every one of those bloody threads in his hands and rhetorically is used them to get elected\nAnd as using them to govern\nI'd I don't you like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and and propaganda but the truth is\nThat he rose to power on fear\nThe rose to power on fear of the other\nOr whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he has an on\nUnbelievable gift for gathering those threads together and rhetorically using them to gain power\nAnd that is a scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country and that that's the concern right and there's no doubt that he was weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that we're in\nI mean he has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states he has the most powerful a and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet warning\nOr that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quote buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August\nAfter visiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about\nThat he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anti immigration stances um and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the is this party where in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republican\nAnd we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that ... may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protested against judge Kavanaugh silly all of these are actually say justice Kavanaugh now but all of these things together to me seems to be I don't know it it it just you know\nTheories some of it is true belief but that this is this an ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be and how come of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case\nUh Howard let me just turn back to you and what do we do about it I mean we even have Lou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running on a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYou know I heard that comment about the SARS occupied State Department\nI think the only answer is leadership is voting as David Was saying uh we uh people have to get out and it's in in an express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to an individual's says to the individual by individual voting it also has to be leaders we have a paradox school system here in the sense that it's of the people by the people for the people are it's from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character\nAnd and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it from from somebody uh from people who come forward as leaders to to\nExplain that America is a community and uh we're individuals and we'd prize individual ism in America ... also community and we can't operate without that\nSo it's going to take leaders come forward to to convince Americans as a whole that there's an answer to using fear and hatred is a way to gain power uh there's there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nRight well rather rent burgundy which have been I Know you want to get a word in here but I Do have to make some space for our callers who've been patiently waiting so let me just go briefly to Lois who's calling from Northampton, Massachusetts Louis you're on the air\nHello thank you for taking my call I'm voting I don't know about leadership um education to talk of a Jew\nAs I'm a conspirator somebody as a hidden hand\nDirecting things manipulating things from behind the scenes this has been a staple it's absolutely central to modern anti Semitism since at least the late Nineteen century there's absolutely no question when a Soros and others are vilified\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Michigan Garrett you're on the air\nThey are having me on right now I think you are a panel for taking time from each day and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what threat for Donald Trump and twenty six Jean and\nYou know our neighbor one of the counties that helped Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to know one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be this consensus of white\nIs Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously it's heavy manufacturing state\nTo state that kind of gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump it gone through the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so just as a progressive guy who was in office there but I Want to ask you this question and in terms of\nYou know what does potentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a blue wave coming in a what the impact and what that leads on the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that lived over\nThere is a proposal ballot your that will potentially um you know changed the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats I guess in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very\nPerplexing yeah eight which you know not many people seem to talk about when it comes to a battleground\nState Garrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there is one state of consequences that that seems poised to have a clue late it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which were Widmer seems to have a pretty sizable\nUm substantial lead in the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is Marge and it was by such a narrow margin ahead it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm\nUp against President Trump than twenty twenty\nYeah and then as Garrett was asking uh it seems to question the he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy and the next two years and how that might that have an impact on a ... on on Michigan on on Michigan in Michigan\nWorkers well it depends a lot on what happens with the terrorists that he opposed ending posed because it's just it's the economic impact\nOf that is sort of uncertain and he alternates between a talking about imposing more ... more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump in his policy that's safe to say it's I kinda don't know what's next\nFor or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think\nIf it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of if something's not working you can just turn them do one eighty into All right we're gonna we're gonna do something else and when it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty race in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and what is it the contrast\nBetween approaches and styles and and their view on the economy as well as how if people feel like the the country's headed and the ride and\nAnd I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races a happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting at some point radio dot org didn't listen to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling shows how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there's also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counts and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election\nDay okay so this is then one of the reasons why I'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian campus the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we are going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a refuting a Brian camps that statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rules\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot he raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of suppression feed the narrative because that hurts oppression and only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidate secretary of state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from ... rooms extreme agenda that she has for a government takeover of healthcare wanting to get the scholarship to those that are here illegally and many many other radicalization\nAs current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp Steven feller ... give us take a minute here to walk us through this controversy in Georgia what exactly has happened with voter rolls in Georgia and how important of an issue has become and the last week of uh of campaigning before the election\nSo the two candidates we have here really are the diametrically opposed ends of voting rights and voting access\nSecretary of state camp has done a lot to clean up the role some people say purge the roles of removing people voting there is also a record number of Georgians registered as of yesterday it was six point nine million people\nAnd the early voting numbers are higher than they've ever been before the twenty fourteen midterms were at one point one million people that have cast a ballot early as opposed to about four hundred thousand and twenty fourteen\nBut on the other hand Stacey Abrams has dedicated a lot of her political career to getting more people to vote getting minorities to vote getting younger people to vote who haven't done and so the two have clashed over the years and it's complicated in this gubernatorial race\nYou're

he's editor and publisher of inside elections that provides nonpartisan campaign analysis Janet Hook is also with us She's national political reporter\nFor the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our callers there's a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nThanks for taking my call [noise] um we're healthcare voters and I'm among other big top big issues I'm leading up to this election\nAnd it is just so utterly ridiculous to hear these claims that these GOP lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions when their votes have said just the opposite and I know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election [noise]\nBut I mean you have you have to be off the grid to not know that these people are attacking people with preexisting condition\n... ... thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what we said well if\nAbout how central the issue health care issue is for the Democrats in every wondered whether or not it was an important in winning issue there's nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue um\nIn past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there's one issue that has really broad residents for people it's the protections for people with preexisting condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided yeah so the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seemed to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races across the country let's go to Nevada here where it in a debate between the candidates for Senate in Nevada\nUh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there and you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen\nA asking senator Heller to tell in Nevada family and their son whose name was dean why Heller quote broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nYou promise and protect their health care and that you would protect our protection from fasting condition\nAnd then you went back to Washington\nAnd you for your promise to cave\nSo I Want to tell you what can the camera there watching tonight\nAnd what they want me to ask you this is to look them in the eye\nReally tell them the truth about why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why he want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nDifferences in terms of considered under jobs do consider it a thousand times it's just not true\nI wrote I wrote the replacement bill for the Republican forward I Know exactly what you're about villa which isn't that bill includes pre existing conditions how shall I say well we'll talk in the eye and tell them to try and survive\nThat's at a debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Meghan Mr Lee she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't point radio dot org Megan welcome to the program\nHi thanks for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race uh between senator Heller and representative Rosen\nAs you just heard during that back but but it's been a huge focal point of the race um you know like like you all are talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic or a first term congresswoman has been\nReally making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to the fact that there was this sort of now in the mid press conference that happened last summer where a Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressing ... concerns about\nThe first repeal in her ... wrote healing replace proposal that Senate Republicans have brought forward\nBut then he ended up actually voting in favor of of you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the the repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she has run numerous ads again and accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act\nShe had this sort of memorable ad\nAttacking holler as senator spineless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him up\nBeen a it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the polls in this late stage telling you\nWrite that this race is still really close and you know if you listen to folks talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into this cycle you know the most\nVulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing re election on you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the old on the most of them within the margin of error so\nYou know everyone is expecting this to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wire so I think you know the big question and and what remains to be seeing as how that message resonates with Nevada's nonpartisan are independent voters here\nUm you know whether they do how the significant concerns about health care and and from what we've seen health care really is a top issue for voters here in Nevada they're like oh\nWell a nation Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking somewhat vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nWell I think I'm One of the reasons why the Republicans have a chance to gain seats was I'm not convinced for Dean Heller joined delusion from look for much of a cycle I really you know we had it as a toss we I think we've and it's a toss up for the whole\nThe whole race will probably keep it there but in in the back of my my like you know I think he's still going to I think he's going to lose and so that it matters to mouth but if he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to Jeff which will concede in Arizona\nThen you know that increases their ability to actually gain seats but now that it's been interesting in a plug for the Nevada independent from Megan in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone\nWhat's what struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected\nYou just like well it's a Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two competitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending a Jackie rations third district\nAnd the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy to move and money and they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think were this was mid term Nevada enough presidential midterm Nevada tends to be more Republican\nMaking what do you think about that\nI think that's that's exactly right and that's one of the interesting thing we can sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen which we saw a complete Red Wings in Nevada and Republicans swept at\nYou know control all of the state's constitutional officers of the legislature on the competitive how the I truly was you know a red wave um which which stands in stark contrast to what happens in twenty sixteen um but but that ... you know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well\nDuring the term elections on what's really going to come to come down to you know all that effort they are putting in with their ground game to try and get folks to turn out with the help of the powerful coronary union here um which is part of what's known as the ... machine are started by you know obviously former science are kind of leader Harry Reid um you know under his his tenure\nAt the big question is can can Democrat you know make this look a little bit more like a presidential year as opposed to to image ... mid term you're in which they traditionally don't parents\nHave such an such an interesting thought that the midterm Nevada midterm any state might be different than president the then that stayed in a presidential year but one question for you making I mean here we are just a week to go before the midterms and I heard you say that you know I'm obviously there's a lot of question around whether", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "29"}
