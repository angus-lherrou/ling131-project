about UN ambassador Nikki Haley and about her decision to step down at the end of this year we're assessing her time\nAt the un and we're going to talk about very specific issues that she let on and spoke out on here and just a minute but I'm joined today by Eliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico and by Colum Lynch un based to cure a senior diplomatic reporter\nAt foreign policy and I just want to play a little bit of sound here of the to get a sense about what Nikki Haley feels or her success was at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump the U.S engages in multilateral is them only on us terms\nSince the secretary general meeting last year we have pulled out of the Paris accord we've pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that is to say that the United states is determined to obviously be involved in multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in a way that they are mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements the United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokes person delivering this message about ambassador Haley's work at the un on ... behalf\nUh this is in response to her decision to step down\nThey had a very productive and strong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey worked hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states joined the value of the United nations secretary general's forward to continuing to work with invested or Haley until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James Stavridis he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive melt the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf gyms to read as well come back to them point\nGreat to be back with you Mary how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success is at the un in part by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreements but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying but there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said she maintained her independence she struck out\nA on a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable a investor for the United states however um I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated\nA I don't think contempt is too strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surrounded and the international constellation so she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I\nWere very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties denigrating international organizations\nOkay well so tell me more about that I mean if you have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of apple find the language of the Trump Administration at the un what are some of those moments that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to\n'em I start with the\nUh on the negative side to withdraw from the climate agreement I think that will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration kind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her particular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on\nA Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons\nOn calling out Russia on its\nAssassination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done\nAbsolutely and I think that in every sense her departure a is a win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and ... in particular\nSo Colum Lynch respond to that I mean this is one question that I had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration one of the most challenging jobs there isn't the administration because of exactly what\nA admirals to read it and said there that are you working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in ... at some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI [noise] I think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that Haley did a very good job of trying to sort of um\nYou know tamped down his most sort of anti you and you know destructive kind of tendencies and was able to kind of bring him along explained to him what the un un was doing trying to bring Jared and ... on board to sort of recognize the benefits of working\nUm you know through the multilateral system but you know she is very much in her remarks that you just played a very much embracing the White House America First I'm sort of doctrine she has\nBeen you know ... and she has been a kind of lead agent and the administration to push for a an end to foreign aid for countries that are not you know close friends of the United states I'm\nAnd she has been you know very very tough on a number of other issues I mean I think at the un she does have a lot of um achievements that she can point to um she did an evil and job and\nLeading the negotiations on I'm sort of a expanding sanctions against North Korea or she has been quite active on some African issues that are others in the administration have shown very little interest in Central African republic the\nUm South Sudan um other sort of humanitarian issues but it's been sort of it's sometimes hard to see you know and in one sense she has sort of um embrace this kind of brand of being kind of a\nA humanitarian actor and others are promoter of human rights within the administration but then that sort of conflicts with her kind of positions on um you know dealing for instance with the Palestinians where she's been quite um quite harsh and and the way that she's dealt with that issue\nElliana Johnson the new uh we've got to let you go here in a minute but I just wanted to get your take on something that seems to read it said that\nUm that there are some things that Nikki Haley that ambassador Haley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to ... you know in her future political career because she was a line so closely with the president you know whether that\nThat's forever in American politics but but that's a reality to this that she's gonna she's going to be wondering about\nListening both to add ... talk and to ah to call him taught\nI I think Nikki Haley I did this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be touting her accomplishments and everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as a moving the U.S Capitol championing the move of of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem things that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those are things she can run on in a Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to defend in a general election I'm absolutely\nWell Elliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much and I was going to have you thank you All right let's get some calls in here let's go to Frida who's calling from Tucson, Arizona Frida you're on the air\nHi thank you [noise] so I'm an independent voter has been for decades eminent objective as I Do vote vote in both parties and I don't think that Nikki Haley came out of this on the case I think her positions on Paris\nA Jerusalem and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal are all major a ... on her part I realized that those were positions or the president Xi is representing but those are not successes I definitely see us out of the country\nHave fallen greatly down on the scale of respect around the world I think supporting and apartheid stayed in Israel is going to be go down in history as a major uh\nThe major flaw to what she thinks are her successes I Would love to have seen her really stand up to the president but I don't think she would have maintained her position I Do think she just pandering to whatever her next political goal is\nYou're listening to the

about UN ambassador Nikki Haley's decision to step down from that post at the end of the year what her legacy in her track record is that there are two years representing the United states in the UN and what could be next\nFor the next UN ambassador and for American foreign policy as a whole and we are joined today by Admiral James to ... he's a former Supreme allied commander at NATO and he's now an operating executive at the Carlyle group and author of the leaders bookshelf\nColum Lynch is also with us he's un based senior diplomatic reporter at foreign policy magazine and gentle moved a lot of callers who want to join us so let me just get some of them in here where at one eight hundred and four to three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk who's go to Vivian who's calling from east vessel borough main you're on the air Vivian\nOkay thank you for taking my call I I Am an independent voter and I don't belong to a party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised by Nikki Haley's\nAttitudes that she took as as a representative to the un she stood up to a lot of the er the that was shown by the human rights organizations\nAnd she did that to let me see\nThat characterize it as a right wing country and ah you know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the Palestinian camp she when she went to visit the Palestinian areas and maybe what happened was\nThat change so that they really weren't so bad luck and um that's maybe why she decided to support Israel and moved to Jerusalem\nWill Vivian Vivian let me go let call them respond to your uh your questionnaire and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nI think you're I think that uh characters isn't true because I mean she went to the to this you know refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nAnd came to new to testify before Congress and made and and passionate personal sort of appeal for them but this these programs really did make life better for them but\nThe alternative was not necessarily be good for U.S interests that you would might the withdrawal of aid my sort of contribute to a promoting the most the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much I'm\nA move by the um by a visit 'em what really I think change your view on this was really um the the dispute over the U.S moving um the embassy the U.S embassy\nVote in which um she was a she was you know cast the veto against fourteen other ... member she was totally isolated um the u._s. was isolated in the U.N General assembly afterwards and I think it was after that this sort of notion that the Palestinians were\nDefying the United states that they were rallying international opinion against the United states had really kind of um shifted her kind of orientation I she became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience\nWell I'm Jim should be someone to come to you and your thoughts about this but just let me I Want to play a little bit of tape here to offer some context this first because I ... the the ambassador Haley has spoken very forcefully about\nUs support and the Trump Administration support for Israel so first of all this is from march two thousand Eighteen so just a little earlier this year and um Bassett or Haley was speaking at the annual American Israel public affairs committee conference in Washington seemed multiple standing ovations a throughout the evening and here's one such moment\nHave sent in an organization with a hundred and Ninety three country\nThe United nations spend half\nTime attacking only one country we will not\nMarch of this year and then to Colum Lynch is point about the UN's response to the United states deciding to move\nA it's a it's it it it's a embassy to Jerusalem last December the un scheduled a vote on a resolution denouncing that move and ambassador Haley at that time tweeted quote that the U.S will be taking names of those who vote\nAgainst the United states that got some pretty extreme reaction here's former U.S ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns on CNN really criticizing Haley for that\nThis was extremely ill advised by the Trump Administration by the president and investor Haley I'm kind of surprised that invest are hairless during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective you know our our ... were a great country where the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective presidents\nThey lead with self confidence and lead was supporting our allies there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council you win some you lose 'em you can't you can't fully your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us some former U.S ambassador to NATO last December James to read us how you respond to that\nI agree with Nick burns hum and I've worked with Nick on multiple occasions including er during the NATO years um he's got a a a pre teen view of all this now having said that\nI think that um the youth and has over the years uh gone way over the top in beating up on Israel and Israel is our strongest ally partnering friend in the middle east but um friends neat to occasionally\nSpeak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked or Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can help close that gap between Israel and the United nations is frankly not in U.S interests to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to be thinking about is\nHow do we close that gap tactically saying things like we're going to take names\nUh is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nI as a U.S up on a on a song attribution in his cabinet hum hum\nA few states the cost of food as or post yeah uh she said her a\nCall and I'm gonna have to jump in on you because your cell phone is a it's breaking up on us it's it's a bit challenging to understand but but James to read if I Know we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling was getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making a more challenging for members of the cabinet to do their job because of the president's position in language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that to the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit a would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more than my two years in any American administration in history and his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go forth and that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that\nOur allies partners and friends are concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy and a ... a good example would be NATO during the campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it\nUh then he went over and I was in a series of conversations that we're not a particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I support article five the an attack on one is an attack on all uh but then subsequently he went back to really excoriated\nThe allies for for spending and we ought to put pressure on them they ought to increase their defense spending\nBut I'm at the same time he he praises people like Vladimir ... and that is confusing and erratic um when coupled with bombastic statements like he deployed in front of the general assembly that does not do us well in our position in the world\nAnd that he's going to name the next UN ambassador so I just wonder I mean the last question do you ... ... you know has Nikki Haley actually sort of provided a model of we were talking about this earlier in the show\nHow to both serve the president a and this particular administration but but operate in the un in a way that doesn't let me know him or herself be defined by it by the president\nAbsolutely correct and uh the problem is going to be that there will be countervailing forces who will take a look at Nikki Haley's performance and say\nYou're

that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt I Love OK hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think\nPart of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not opened up of adopted children mind you but and I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that that your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race I mean thinking\nAbout this from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I am really sympathize and I know how difficult it is\nUm I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just things I Wish I had in my toolkit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they weren't given at the time either I think and they've expressed this to me that they wish they had then offered more in the way it information not like warning that don't\nRacially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with him about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family um that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know\nI'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted her adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we've gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you know they ask many questions just nobody really was telling them the there's some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how you answer this question or\nTalk to your child about racism nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to to to have those conversations I think\nOkay now so I can hear it and fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about uh was was something difficult enough to handle 'em or know know what to do with how to come through that\nBut in addition to the ... was there was there all along in that you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of was there a longing or an emptiness was something that you felt that needed to be filled because of you know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same\nFeatures are complex and as you saw with your parents\nYeah I think I was it wasn't so much an empty nester like I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did kingly feel once I was old enough to notice and once\nI was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly I'm In a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only like ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable um\nI don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships in great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt it I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like very white schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family that was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this is guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true\nThat that might not be and can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what matters finally decided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in the book my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I hadn't become apparent that other times I'm convinced that I Would have eventually search no matter what you know it's nothing that have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious I wondered\nUm I had gotten a little bit of information um that was available to me without making contact a state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve\nUm but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final punished I remember sitting at um\nNice and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birth\n'em and why I was born so prematurely um because I was I was born about ten weeks early and I don't know I had no answer that was actually really scary to be seen my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and childbirth I just\nI don't know something about my ... my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family that I was really scared and also [noise]\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think\nEvery parent goes through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and they can only those questions only become far more acute when there's so many on answered a issues in in the the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers who want to join us and uh and I just want to get at least a couple of them\nHere to be able to share their stories we can you hang on for a second one was Willie welcomes ... absolutely let's go to Jim is calling from El Eldridge Pennsylvania Jim you're on the air\nYes hello thanks for taking my call um I just have a story of my ah I'm white I'm my first wife and I we adopted a two children of color um one when he was six weeks old and the other or when he was two years old um and there was a year a difference between them so\nUm my my story starts when they're like a forty years old and a three years old [noise] and um they're all grown up now other twenty and Twenty one\nBut a a one day we're walking through the uh Walmart parking lot and just me and them and I've got one by chance and a kind of out of nowhere the younger one jak he says\nNo I'm Sorry I'm a little nervous I'm On the radio that's alright older one Isaac ... like he was about four years old he says he says that he says\nWhy are you white and were black and you know right then it's like oh goodness I didn't think I'd have to have this conversation in a Walmart parking lot you know mhm I'm so I'm ...\nI don't well he started oh isn't it I go to answer him\nAnd my younger son jak who is lighter skin um he stops he stopped right away three years old he stops key ripped says handed out of my hand and he says\nI'm not black on white huh and so now I turn to him because oh my goodness I I hadn't thought about\nHow they view themselves you know yeah and uh you know the younger one he was a a a mixture of a you know African American and Hispanic\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I don't know how long is that unusual\nNot really isn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment birth parents get the least\nAnd they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so\nIt it's not something they usually do place children for adoption in ... in their situation so I think there are so many pieces to this that are familiar and difficult and again every stories a case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's the whole family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of her sisters did you know ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is did that process than help\nUh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family do to get you to the place that you would hope you were hoping to to to go\nGaps I was aware of at the time I searched were just simply kind of cats and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or are there other factors I certainly cared about\n'em I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is\nOne of the reasons I searched but I think it was really from my sister's especially my full sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information I'm In a she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um and so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always steel\nAnd I I wasn't really part of this family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please Saddam medical history and if I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I respect that\nSo but Cindy Cindy was this was her family family the only ones who got and I think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers\nAnd that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps in knowledge well this is obviously an issue that has had an impact on many people's\nLives 'cause we've got a stack of callers and I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\n\nHi thanks for taking my call um I was raised in the south or in the sixties and seventies adopted Fifteen Years ago a beautiful young man from a laudable and my question is is I don't have any experience how do I prepare my son for living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experience racism John\nYeah I had lived in upper middle class life uh went in the military where there's very little racism than you know I'm just face those issue yeah how do I prepare my son to go out in the world he knows very dark he's you know going but basically saying I don't know what to tell him\nJoyce you have an answer for John well like you know there that's a huge question by one of the answers is to make sure you surround yourself with people of color especially you know if he's African American\nUm you know I make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for on models for him and that you look for help for you uh you know the best people to help you to understand how to deal with racism or people who have experienced it\nAnd so ... and it's also good for him to see you claiming these people who are like him and not just him yeah let's go to Dana who's calling from Glen falls New York dinner you're on the air\nHi um I'm a white parent of two Asian um daughter the Asian American now uh we began our adoption process about Twenty years ago and\nI feel really grateful that we had the agency we did I had I had no knowledge of how to do this when I when we started but one of the requirements of her agency was that we attend numerous workshop throughout the process\nAnd a few of them involved adult adoptees who\nUm [noise] um where people of color are adopted by white parents who shared their stories which in many cases were not so good mhm and made clear to us how important it was for one thing I'm\nNot you know to the extent we could don't live in a segregated white community I live in a place where our kids were", "year":
