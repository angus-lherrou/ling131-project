consequences of global climate change it's a very dire new report and it's based on more than six thousand sided studies written by Ninety One authors from forty different countries\nAnd saying that if we continue on the path that we are now globally\nThat the devastation that climate change could cause would change human civilization permanently I'm joined today by Chris Mooney covers climate change energy and the environment for the Washington Post ... del also joined us he's professor of climate sciences at Duke University and was one of the authors on yesterday's report by the inter governmental panel on climate change\nAnd we want to hear from you where it eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk a and Christian drew I just want to play us a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski scientist and lead author of the IPC the report and he said that we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nAnd lots of it but learning that doing so will also have some consequences\nTo limit more bang to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this and quit planting trees bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage changed lawns management as well as some normal approaches that sort of at a at least stages of development\nHowever carbon dioxide removal on a large scale could have implications for food security for ecosystems an for bio diversity\nThat's Jim ski scientist and lead author of the PCC report Chris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as as he talks about there\nBut it's this it's when he said that um remove all on a large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about\nWhat he's talking about is this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that emissions has to be cut at of extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry\nThe polls carbon monoxide out of the air and this doesn't exist now some people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies and in climate models in one of the ways in which they imagined it a involves planting huge essentially plantations\nOf trees are crops and using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they were burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plants and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food uh so what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze and now that sounds like a a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I think that taking the risk that we can emit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out\nYou know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this is a enormous gamble with the future of our whole planet and and I think you know where the turning over a large portion of our arable land\nTo grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer has enormous implications for biodiversity inability to feed the planet and so forth caught our eye missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios to do this in the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carbon removals you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon removal that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires\nThe most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon of any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying well with some of that tree planting globally uh be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\nThat would generally be restoring abandoned land marginal lands on so we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away with out really compromising most of our arable land\nOkay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting scenario the aggressive emissions cutting scenarios that you're talking about are they going into that they're just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an ... an issue with that that affects us also let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question [noise]\nSorry my question is when the people that are profiting from the destruction of than my arm at like ... or whatnot when will they be held accountable like the conversation very scary but I never take the money on\nAnd so I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nTaxes or something to fund programs or the thing the actions taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes and just just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking that there is something that people make millions on oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean among the first of all thank you for your call in because many do you have a response from her for her\nWell [noise] I don't know I I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change is the consequence of industrial civilization it's the consequences of all of us\nAre deciding you adopt the technologies that we created um that make our lives better a driving you know heating your home cooling your home\nAnd many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy is mostly burn fossil fuels so the way that we live\nAnd the scale at which we are\nUsing energy is really a what's at stake here um so yes there's companies that sell energy a ... at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently um so\nIt drew shouldn't do pick up on that thought because I mean I think ... exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're saying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible\nWell there is an end\nAnd people consuming too much red meat and\nYou know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also\nAn indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies an automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry and this was a measure that would nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they got the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with ouch even counting for the environmental cost so what's happening in reality\nIs that we all pickup these costs no more than a hundred billion a year in disaster relief expenditures everybody's health care premiums go up when people suffer from heat waves and suffer from air pollution and so\nThese companies really are profiting\nBy imposing a hidden tax on every other part of American business and American consumers and I think until we do change that like something you said may not carbon tax that really reflects the true cost of these activities we are not going to make the shift that aren't necessarily\nLet's go to Larry who's calling from middle field Connecticut Larry you're on the air\nI I'm just want to mention that I

one eight hundred nine four seven auto\n\nTo some point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change is new report\nAbout what the future will hold if we continue emitting carbon dioxide into the air the rates that we are now and how much of a change civilization all level change humanity is going to have to undergo in order to get a hold on a climate effects are carbons effect on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he is lead author of the eye PCC report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fought the evidence the calls it says up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what he said about global warming\nMom is talking about all of this was the global warming and do that a lot of it's a hoax hawks I mean it's a money making industry okay so\nThat's December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's reports\nUh I mean we're two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think\nUh about what the the president's attitude was about global warming\nWell unfortunately well he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both parties supportive environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIt's more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're toting things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm cold is is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fuels just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace ...\nChris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a from above a response to the ... report\nYes we have statements from the state department and also I'm from\nI'm In our story actually I'm ... wheeler you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world the below a dangerous level of climate change and ah it didn't identify specific level but he pointed out um what BP is doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies\n'em and these technologies will be exported to other countries are so they're wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard from the world's coal association or they're saying that because this report quarterly targets colon says that we're going to have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely in what they're saying is\nActually no we need to create technologies that captured the emissions of coal and buried blow the ground\nUm so that's one of the angles or that is being taken on the report I'm\nYeah I'm seeing here that a State Department official I'm as you're reporting that said that\nGovernments do not formally indoors specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one present during the same time so so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there\nWell and it's it's not in direct us emissions have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world's to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius\nAll right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\nHigh magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I I guess more like a question ... comment um I think making and significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best\nHope of of actually making change so high and it's like a key campaign like this and that um you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with it unfortunately it's not enough to make a dent on and\nOn the problems that we had in the environment and but it is even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't send me from one day is that enough to make a change yeah\nWill brief thank you I'm a I'm a I didn't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to drew Chanel a individual level efforts a professor she can do is breeze asking could they make a difference\nThey can and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems just from so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking for what we looked at was people in primarily in the west\nWho eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines just going back to what's best for them right so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge sacrifice we're asking people to do\nWhat they should do anyway for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land the deforestation the land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport but biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport it's also good for your health you know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars unless there is charging infrastructure and currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax\nOn electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them [laughter] so\nWe can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners only if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of product so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available let's go to\nKevin who's calling from ... Louisiana Kevin you're on the air\nHello Hi Kevin what's your idea\nIs that how you doing I just had a comment to make 'em you know I work in the internal industry\nAnd um there's a lot of infrastructure that's already in place like in the Gulf of Mexico per se as\nTwo thousand platforms out there that has jazz jackets and the water might be a little less met but at least a thousand where wind farms could be adapted for those jackets easily I mean but they're naturally infrastructure what happened to be built to you know the power generation would give it to the beach\nBut that's something that that could be done also went on when an oil company those exploration on a certain area\nThey have to mitigate somewhere else it doesn't matter they drop and drop all they're not if the jeopardy clean the whole time\nThey have to spend money to mitigate another area that needs mitigate now needs restoration mhm so it's it's a balance you know and they do spend money and to the good I guess some people would call it to the you know mining industries some people it's bad yeah but we use it we need it you know I just not so much more common\nLittle ... Kevin thank you actually so much for your call because many do you want to respond him I think that first pies Kevin indicating that I mean he's out there working in the Gulf Oil fields saying that there is an infrastructure in place if we wanted to to expand a wind generation\nWell there's actually a close relationship between offshore oil and offshore wind I mean you you you find a company like status oil um which is a major oil producer now going a very strong into the uh offshore wind industry and that sort of the deep\nOffshore wind industry which is where you need really really powerful infrastructure and where some of the most powerful when can be harnessed and if you can get it to shore than you can get yourself quite a lot of renewable energy I I think I think it goes to show that there is a corporate transition that's happening right now again the it's not at the pace\nWNPR dot org slash\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

or whatever\nYou're listening to Alex huddled visualizing the route that he took to free solo climb seventies el ... and that's him going through step by step all the moves he would make\nIn order to conquer the one of the world's most famous a rock climbing walls and he did it with no ropes that effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy Chin and Alex ...\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climbed you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move 'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about with the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I Move my body\nBut then you know from my new for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep us you know the rest of the pitcher I could just count on myself to to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole whole face so many times that are kind of just remembered most of it\nOr you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay [laughter] but so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense I mean first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental armor one is\nI actually um I actually don't call them in ... in the film Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quoting something I'm like I've\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin stout offering online undergraduate and graduate degrees and professional education that certificate options for adult learners you W stout dot edu slashed WNPR\nMight shield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt that wasn't really a a sustainable way to climb oh crap I get is just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that\nThat at some point you know it's sort of come to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall is the wall and I'm and I am capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up for anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus in work that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film and a half two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I'm into took a long time to show comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I'd been dreaming about it and thinking about it in climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I could talk to you for the whole hour about the technical had preparation and I'm feet of climbing el kept but\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free so many of them have died and then that is shown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climber Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the deaths of the world's best free solar climbers\nI think everybody who is made free cell I'm a big part of their life\nBack or with a pioneer in so called three solo climbing the mountain when this past week at the age of fifty two\n... and the death of us climate showing Larry [noise] show them was killed in Utah was found a couple of days ago there were seeing was climbing and do some of the valley his body was found Saturday morning mercy climb as usual alone without road most\nPeople that are pushing the limits they have\nMentality of screw it whatever happens happens [noise]\nDown there from the documentary free so low I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing with no ropes that has really that really drew you in\nA yeah well yeah good good question um I mean basically you know I mean so not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes free cell and can mean scrambling a beautiful ridge and the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for rope climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an antisocial youngsters so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the the feeling of freedom to speed the efficiency I mean there there's a certain joy in in climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing a stone a small fraction of of my normal climbing yeah you know I'd I'd\nI climb all styles you know all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various various types of climbing in and free zone is always sort of represented this this extra little side\nBut you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean you\nKnow uh yeah I'd I totally understand that and I mean it certainly always been a variance\nOh it's only a small part of our dear okay has been sort of the most significant and a lot of was\nStill talk to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads are I mean is it is it assumed that you just cannot enter or experiencing any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience about feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into a feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling of flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you know feeling like you're you're close to to talk to your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here here's why ask okay because I mean a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know I'm On in in some beautiful places in the west the United states and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climb that I did that I got a little better and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my like low level climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering mind and body\nDuring of constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what would I enjoy about ... seats for the bigger challenge is things that are slightly harder than what you've done before so we feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit better what you do but of course\nWith ... the costs of the mistake or absolute so you know you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but in another to blend\nWell I mean we're ... number one I mean we're all going to die I'm I'm trying my best not to dark climbing are very much want to move to old age and her family and all that but um no I mean I I don't\nThink that if I just keep pushing middle for sure dark climbing or some time ago well\nLet me just reiterate nobody wants that [laughter] but um let me let me get some calls in here because we've got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex uh we're speaking with Alex ... he is a professional rock climber a best known\nFor free so loving and in fact he did a free solo Yosemite is el Capitan it's a three thousand foot wall in Yosemite one of the most famous rock climbing walls anywhere in the world he did it without ropes and that story is captured in the documentary free so low which is directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy ... so\nLet's go to Kay who's calling from the new Ohio okay you're on the air\nI make that and you did at several of the questions I was going to ask Alex about what drives him and that that that edge of a risk and you know that\nThat drive to conquer but I go back and forth from Boulder, Colorado to Ohio and so for the last forty five years so there's huge rock climbing community there and about four years ago go at the Boulder film festival they showed about four different\nAgain as she said and you just said there's this you're living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people who have been seen this and uh and they just see it as like oh well your brain's defective so obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it\nOr I mean I've always heard it as as you know ... with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know it's I suppose it's a little bit open ended\nYeah but one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to get a caller who wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to get his calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\n... um you know it's one thing to watch your preparing to go through in a regular on the wall where you are in their every move but\nThere's also the aspect of family and loved ones and I was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you prepare um before going out of one of these ... feet like al kept\nTo a photo of loved ones or anything like that ever come into your mind while you're in the ... stone multi thousand focused on\nYou know I mean that does and that's probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate about because in order words reselling is easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis or sort of argued that uh that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level I just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationship\n[noise] well I mean it scares was asking though in the middle of a big climb I mean well let's talk about al ... ascent yes you know on August ... did you think of her or is would you bring that I mean how how\nFocused on the on the harder sections which represents maybe half the route um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing moves interest performing but then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners uh\nI mean I remember specifically on on the free souls or cap I spent you know maybe a five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey and then\nYeah I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked out about my girlfriend uh [laughter] you know when I'm finished\nYeah well I mean ... as you're right in a free so does the movie doesn't explore um your relationship with Saudi McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free solar climbing\nI Want to like I Want to have my own listing price that you have any I mean I like minds one knew what we want to do while we're hearing a time when people die\nFeel like I Want to eat in half way\nWhen you sound like detaining indirectly [noise]\nRussia than going to be on\nWith putting him stand patient actually haven't changed anything when you actually make decisions differently\nI had some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan\nLike you obviously I'd have to give up so long\nTo me asking you do you see that as", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Madison", "day": "09"}
