the workplace there was a special New York times investigative series that took a look into\nA incidences of some some in some cases extreme incidences of alleged pregnancy discrimination and what happened and why that series was co reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and ... and they they join us today and we also want to hear from\nFrom you do you think that we're plays accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask for combinations from your employer uh and got them\nOr were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm having your work changed because of your pregnancy might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your dismissal were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five this eight hundred for two three talk also want to hear from employers about uh the situation from from your point of view\nIf you're an employer how much combination can you make and what are the realistic concerns that employers have about the limits too accommodating uh employees during pregnancy again we're at eight hundred for two or three to five five\nNow I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there\nYou're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas in two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it and she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for\nHer supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor and got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't accept your doctor's no because we have water I don't see the water fountains available to you I\nWas just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of having this big deal and they read and scrutinizing my doctor I decided to go against what my supervisor gifted and listened to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you have to go\nThat's how they're Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen\nNow it doesn't get silver Greenberg ... ah in the course of your reporting how did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you've found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt they had experience in the workplace while they were pregnant\nSo I think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common this experience was\nWhen you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the way that me too has and\nWe were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of very similar experiences from women all the way up and down the economic ladder and blue collar jobs in low wage jobs in office jobs for this\nI can say that uh we went to Texas together\nI mean to Texas to to Memphis together um and uh we had to in many cases\nGo back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal than devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us yeah\nAnd and I imagine the the extreme difficulty that the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to the extreme difficulty was compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were ... yeah\nExactly um so it was a paycheck and it was also health insurance and again just when I talk to people who are still working at the warehouse so these are folks who are at again great personal risk\nComing forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job\nRight now I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that the the warehouse company that use that many of these women or all the women in their ... your second story most of them that where they work\nDid the company not also said that they just do the allegations because of uh currently though their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\nYes they they did say that they said that um they said they believe that these allegations were manufactured drummed up an exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is\nCurrently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points to kind of mentioned that\nNone of so with the exception of one woman's I'm\nTasha morale who ultimately left the warehouse on and has become an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women were affiliated with the union at all so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all\nAnd you have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing to the Teamsters in a broader context which as they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so we and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm\nA pretty basic set of disputed facts so for instance when he describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story as they age and window is\nThey just eat the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows it has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't usually see sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nRight there are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that those exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement I think you need and the credibility of a denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than\nSay you know whether or not a woman\nHad a miscarriage on the floor\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now and there's an interior window I can see out into the whole way of our radios\nI can also see hot into a into a room where a man is working\nSo you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the legal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here in just a minute with both of you Jessica and Italy but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their stories and if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma join and you're on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first spine and um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't\nWell I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing was it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories I'm as well as all my other things and all these other men were just sitting there and what I thought were like at least co workers like a friend level on that level\nIt it didn't prove to be and it just makes me so sad that actually I just saw that friend of mine and she's pregnant and she's now an attorney a title attorney and she's having the same problems and so it's still very relevant and I don't know if it's just oil and gas is a good old boy kind of thing but\nI just really hope and pray that\nBall you know you see the day that men really want to look out for their women to just help us\nWill do anything to do the work [laughter] you know\nYeah Joanna thank you so much for your call and thank you for sharing your story let's get another story in here Erin is calling from Des Moines Iowa Aaron you're on the air\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public

investigative series on this topic it was reported by\nJessica silver Greenberg ... joined us today from New York I'm also joined by Joan Williams she's a professor of law at the University of California Hastings and director of the center for work life law\nThere and let's go to the to the phones once again and take a call from Lee who's calling from Fort Mill South Carolina Lee you're on the air\n\nI I figured I could be the same token male I was a nurse for Fifteen Years working in a profession that is only three to four percent male wanted with three of the people that you've had speak each one of them on our beyond accommodation which\nOf a disability it however temporary to a plea for preferential treatment on specifically talking about one of the ladies\nWho mentioned that people didn't understand she had children and that they assigned her shift that could have been assigned to the child was the single but that they didn't accommodate a CI had children that goes way beyond any workplace accommodation\nI was also a paralegal for a decade even one worker's comp and injury\nIf there are there is a lot of requests for understanding in a situation in which accommodating physical disability which is simply a simple ... aren't getting pregnant\nIs I've stood on fours and watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're having morning sickness or accommodating some you know hey they're going to come get me when I was a male nurse like pick somebody up good matter just because she weighs Ninety eight pounds\nShe can't lift like I can get some of those are simple mhm when you start moving into it you shouldn't have to work nights they ... on the single people don't have shoulder that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nLee I I hear you actually in and I I Want to turn your a call back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um and Joe Millionaire turn this to you but at least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr and give me a second here just that this outbreak because I think it was the last time or one of the more recent times that uh that we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace\nDriver Peggy young doctors that she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because it put her at risk of miscarriage ah so she was told to stay home a meaning she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case went all the way to to the Supreme Court and in a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy young described what happened\nSo I went to the doctor and got into it with my restrictions and I turned out in and basically they said you know we don't provide light duty for pregnancy go home and tell you how long are pregnant\nI should say in two thousand Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but Joe Williams my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent\nIn that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr some really interesting to see it and I think leave call echoes a lot of what Justice Scalia said back then he he wrote for example that prohibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others of similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favored employees\nThan it gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors they would have to offer show first pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age it would have to pay pensions to workers who cannot work because of childbirth so he says it's implausible the current federal law\nWhich elsewhere creates a guarantee of equal treatment here alone creates a guaranteed a fever treatment what do you think about that\nUm well that's not true I'm Lee does have a good point on it's not illegal but it's very bad practice um two Everytime you have an undesirable shift give it to somebody who's single doesn't have or doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers\nOn and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes\nTo take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because a pregnancy need to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers to accommodate the person with diabetes often don't accommodate the person I'm with a with the pregnancy\nAnd blue collar context and I think about what Joanna said she said we can do the work I remember reading one woman saying oh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what Joe in saying\nI'm often and blue collar contexts women can do the work but the employer might fence and reading hundreds of these cases\nIs um the employer didn't want to hire these women and the first place and so I figure it's great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on the eve and fire them and that's what the young versus UPS decision a began to put an end to\n... not just because silver Greenberg and Natalie ... how there there have been attempts though since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgraded modernization of all laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers fairness and that's been a kind of center piece of um efforts to strengthen the federal law and filling the gaps that the that exist in a pregnancy discrimination act\nThere's been effort since so every congressional sessions and twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced the pregnant workers Fairness Act so far it has not made it out of committee so it has not made it out of the um help committee which stands for health

N. F. though you say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons is inflate the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more\nThan the thousands of nuclear weapons are already have and in this case it did Bolton is pulling out an old ... is using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with ideological grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the the Russians who have modified and existing weapon to give it a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites in European Russia and apparently in one out of sight\nWe're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we've been detecting since about twenty fourteen\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently and arms control treaty their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't repeal the burglary laws you enforce them\nBy repealing this treaty you're allowing ... to do whatever you want now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want in Europe and here's the the the really bad part\nIt's unlikely that we can match it cause for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country that wants to them but no European ally wants them yes why you're seeing how of complaint\nFrom France from from Germany from the European Union who warned that you're taking down and these are the words a pillar of European security no one needs a new arms race says the foreign minister of the European Union\nAre among among others that's what they were afraid of that Trump is fighting an arms race that was already brewing as ...\nNuclear arms and now they're afraid that Europe once again be battleground\nFor these two nuclear giants battle right I mean Europe is signaling as lovely as it can it discomfort with the possibility of an end of the IMF treaty I mean I'm seeing here the sigma Gabriel who just stepped down in March as German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear madness I mean we should recall that ... is one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry in Europe which is one of the things that led to a the the INS to begin with not just wants you and I know you have a lot more to say but I Want to welcome in one more\nUh ... voice into this conversation Evelyn focus joins us now she joined us today from Washington She's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative Eurasia center and the ... Center for strategy and security\nShe also served from two thousand twelve to twenty Fifteen in the Obama administration as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia and one fourth is welcome to you\nThank you magnify great to be here so I'm very eager to hear your take on this given your experience here do you think the Trump Administration is a is doing is on the right track here in terms of its desire to pull out of the INS well\n... unfortunately I don't really see\nA better option right now because the Russians essentially put our back to the wall this is really like going back to Nineteen eighty seven where\nActually our European allies the Germans asked us to step in and counter the Russian short short range or medium range missiles that were deployed and threatening Europe at the time\nWith our own missiles so in that case the Europeans wanted us to help them out and President Reagan did so but did so\nI think ... largely in a way that he was able to use it to negotiate the Russians out of their own missiles and that's how we got the intermediate nuclear forces treaty\nAnd I having been in the administration [laughter]\nI Know that we tried very hard\nTo confront the Russians to convince the Russians um to do what we could using words\nTo deter them from continuing to violate the agreement but they did not stop 'em as you noted in the beginning this has been public since two thousand fourteen I'm the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff testified openly that the Russians have deployed this capability these missiles and\nSo what are we going to do I think that for the U.S government the best option unfortunately at this point is to do what we did in eighty seven which is to threaten to counter so the burglars burglar at us\nWe then send another burglar outside of their house have that burglar stand there and say if you don't stop we're going to send our burger and\nThe problem is the way I think the Trump Administration went about it it doesn't sound like they consulted it doesn't sound like they had a plan that included our NATO allies\nUm or or the issue of how to deal with the Asian theater so that's that's the issue I think\nToday well I wouldn't focus a couple of quick questions here um you first of all you heard Joe Syrians you and he just a few minutes ago saying that he sees\nThe way to counter the Russians is through the very instrument of the ... treaty itself and that by by you know deep sixteen the treaty you've lost what is perhaps the most effective mechanism to push back those intermediate range missiles or the that Russia you know as you said we've been talking about this twenty fourteen\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Virginia Margaret you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call I find the whole idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear a treaty buying\nAnd a logical to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons is is going to make the world safer we already have more than seven thousand nukes I Believe\nAnd I don't see how the idea of increasing that number is going to make the world and they say are we have enough to destroy the world many times over all ready it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call Ellen far just how would you like to respond to Margaret um well first to I'm Cal than if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be\nFrom with our adversaries and\nI guess my thinking with regard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now given the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt that that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and from these heavier enemies with regard to Margaret's point I agree I mean I Do not think we should be wasting money on developing nuclear weapons that we don't need\nAnd that's the whole point of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is a ... also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother show on that\nJust rinse your new turn back to here because of course uh we we could also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we will return to it but China has been lurking here uh a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the INS here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... were the ... us is constrained by the ins and not able to\nDeploy strategic weaponry in in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier because of this and that that's putting us ... Kelvin term behind the eight ball in Asia\nYou always have to be very careful when you hear people who want new nuclear weapons no language they use so John Bolton says you know what I'll outmoded treaty violation ignored were constrained\nAnd so you know it feeds into that feeling that we're being were the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons that\nA hundred times more weapons than you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into the trap\nOf nuclear war planters planners who who see this and some kind of a board game where you have to match piece for peace so on China\nWhat they're talking about is that China a land power doesn't have much of a navy doesn't have much of a an air force that can reach beyond us borders they have new for now [laughter] okay for now\nThey they they have a nuclear weapons are up about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to all seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like real like warm\nOr anything like the United states they have about forty to reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us from building those but we have see based missiles are hungry to interest\nOr based weapons that can reach them fought just fine we have strategic submarines the crowd the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons ... that can have them for every one that they have their can hit us we don't need to match 'em and here's the other off underline reality there's\n... there's nobody in no one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said\nThat they do not want us to part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match weapon\nWell everyone versus a ... I think the the deeper one of the deepest points that Joe is making here uh it's worthy of of some dispute discussion here for the discussion because it and I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to just point that what there is no need for land based I'm intermediate range missiles when we have such a a overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use\nNo one wants us to use them but that that are there for a for U.S Strategic purposes in the Asia theater\n[noise] well I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planners so I it's a little bit out of my\nLeague to say definitively that we don't need those weapons um I Will say however that it is true that\nOur president and I wouldn't say members of his administration necessarily better president does speak of America is that for a declining power as if we're not the the strongest military power on the globe right now the strongest diplomatic power at least potentially were squandering that every day\nUm and of course still the strongest economic power so I Do think it's worth bearing in mind that we do have the upper hand and the reason the Russians are developing the capabilities that they're developing has to do with the fact that they can't go head to head with us or the Chinese they have to develop asymmetric means\nAnd I think the real issue here has to do with Russia's\nFeeling of vulnerability the lack of what they call strategic stability in our defense relationship\nAnd their desire to do something to correct that and I think this administration needs to sit down and have some real\nBlonde conversations with the Russians about the state of our defense relationship about the various dangerous asymmetric asymmetric things the Russians are doing to try to get an edge on us like developing missiles not just these missiles that other missiles um like their cyber\nCapabilities the fact that they have inserted a box or other um cyber\nSupport for WNPR comes from grand lodge hotel and water park in Wausau offering family fun with a water park arcade and restaurant family sweets are available more on booking a fall get away is that state G.
