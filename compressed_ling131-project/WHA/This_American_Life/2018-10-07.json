Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet read over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved his version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last week\nHas been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nAnd this morning that they have\nAlso we talked about it wasn't but there was a\nIt was a thing got the thing that convinced him\nProtesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault\nIt's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before fleeing I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nSupport what do you believe women we\nThank you what do you have to say please something you can say that went in right now in the survivors\nGlover having this or\nAffect you and people yelling like that [noise]\nThe sleek making fun of himself talked about before\nLike lots of men his age doesn't connect you well to emotions\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge cap and I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators\nTrying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certain to go out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that trust\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the Ford cabinet testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't this off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything in a decision on a boat\nHas been this just\nTo debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that all of us we're all you know [noise]\nNext morning of course like finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the head and you've got to come back to\nPresent to the ...\nGoes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise]\nMeanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that flake the yes he chokes up reportedly says\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason struggling sorry a lot of tears in the capital those two days\nThe meeting begins the two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably check Twitter because he usually does but he says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR Pitt says he wasn't thinking about that at all\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied that the FBI report [noise] do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people [laughter] that stuff for several years apart you know\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child to stand in the middle of to quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family [noise]\n\nChase ... program which turned out it is a recording that we found of Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is the retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years the same being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today it's just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through it well I like my own\nYou know remember the\nSenate is a political party and they have to act in a political way\nThe ...\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nOr to recognize\nAnd integrity of our court\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nUh the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMy self was of\nFascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about\nSome some southern southern southern southern slanted a as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience of putting high school students people asking ... cases you've always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explain this job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um and discuss the case uh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision\nOr the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just\nReverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get and let's say five to four the\nFive in the majority don't have a lot of ... laps and high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realized one of us will have\nTo write an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nAre an opinion that explains\nTeach the principles\nOf law or the principles of the constitution of the control as a result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case [noise] uh we draw down on that capital of trust we make a withdrawal on the trust that in the public has it in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish that trust\nBy it hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nAnd fairness and quiet discussion\nAnd courtesy and scholarship [noise]\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nWe have one more story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nWas meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd one attorney raised his hand and said now you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and I divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nI Will take them home and read the briefs the second time over the weekend just before arguments and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to al ... [noise]\nWell the minute I that that I I kinda knew I lost the ... they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually\nPretentious thirty I heard some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because the attorney in the room raised his hand\nAnd said oh I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it is that are the ones to expect it to six back [noise]\nI thought I think I remember your last one was a three six pack\nIt was done [noise] wire like beer [noise]\nTo form club the Palm Beach is the recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up a total and complete amateur\nHas to decide a death sentence was only previous experience in these matters watching law and order that's in a minute ... radio when our program continues\nAn unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed on the next radiolab how many people do we say killed by the police each year our police shooting more black people and white people\nWe don't know there's no national statistics on the hill and keeps accurate statistics on police shooting of ... other mothers who've lost their children I cannot believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control [noise]\nThat's on the next radiolab at three on the ideas network\nThere are many things to enjoy in Wisconsin in every season of the year Wisconsin Public radio is here three hundred sixty five days a year to serve you with informative thought provoking programs thank you to WPRI members who support makes it all possible\nWisconsin Public radio stay connected with the whole state thanks to its network of seven bureaus with reporters on the ground across Wisconsin WPRI provides a news service that connects with issues that matter to your life to stay in touch with WNPR\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nJust American Life marriage glass today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled\nWith difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us in the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's teen and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something they've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is\nA more serious one anyway here's Johnny book staying\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole [noise]\nThat would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nLike let them live [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend\nNever expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness she had given me hands if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it\nIt wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor its fan it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are like ... ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nI did began to reply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and that sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\nFeel like you're really ready for [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was set the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected\nHappened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judas cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing well should have done to begin with for not following my good for not Brian [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or\nEven the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you\nEntered object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue and reads and I hope I'm not being too forward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forward originally email just then once you send two years ago\nThe one he can't stop thinking about\nWhen I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word\nInstead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\nI don't I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in the hotel suite downtown where I can stop offering food that she can stop producing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea\nMaryland is Tom Allen stately with smiling eyes she's in slacks boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll makes you have now than they are because she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people I knew you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come take\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the mobile and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member who are out is the cause of all of this and that was a very hurtful it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my child and I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality jobs she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son so it's\nKind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nI'm In Manhattan\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family\nHave all moved on to win Maryland red spends article\nShe saw him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay the sentence\nThe death penalty I thought I had that I\nI thought I had literally died it didn't even register because I'm just like what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing\n'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he has and I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you involved in a heinous crime that the true a monster but he wasn't a monster\nThere is no okay so she is going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for us\nI think that probably ... then they sit in as the ... and it's been a fan\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before he gets a\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spend this at the door [noise]\nI spent a Jonathan it's very nice immune from errands here now how do you\nSpend with the okay\nWe'll get a lot of Venn lingers in the door the hotel room down a have a seat over there uh he's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater it looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous [noise] and so\nThere were there with a lifetime Maryland in spanned and been in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent sat and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside her to do in a while you can't quite bring himself to look at it or as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] a rather than I re read it and I even began so her letters or the number one\nI don't want to write a letter of trying to make me feel better you know what I mean from the moment the vote was cast or however grab a I'm doing wrong", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city":
