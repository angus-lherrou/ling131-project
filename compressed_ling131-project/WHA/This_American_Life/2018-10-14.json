P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nAt the school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training the running to first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district in rural Ohio there's that his record 'em a condition that we not see their name on the air\nDate people on this team only two teachers volunteered for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team this year there's a pollock watch them doing this research so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThough did fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble\nGetting into the safe you had to put your finger on the sensor as of\nAnd it's a little tricky\n\n\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John\nThe principal for gray six to twelve [noise]\nHe's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and one of these shootings another kid can kill enough of this way\nI'll marry wearing and the elementary wearing [noise]\n\n[noise] I'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school goes into lock down\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nGoes wherever you're trying to unlock the door\nHere we go\nAll right here we go [noise] Oregon [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just tightening their side\nMy great that wasn't the attorney compare to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was he got here is the doors\nAre\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even habits on police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and start learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know the first time he should've gone that's pretty scary it was scary to me [noise]\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise]\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nRight and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't\nLet it be me who hurts\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that's who the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed\nBut these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen [noise]\nGet an effort that we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll to pass to dissipate the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help the\nBBC Chicago this American Life America last [noise]\n\nA\n... ...\nTo figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think that if they weren't prepared than the worst day I mean they knew what to do me what to do\nEven still even with that and he still has\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question one of our producers Robin semi and went to ... to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMost of all ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for a fire for every period for every dish is what a code black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were ... silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy\nTheir on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors with paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nAnd that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing are cool what she did\nShe no it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety second says kids are reading by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she still enter doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThere are following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was in the lab and there were terrified people reading and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol I follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and\nShe kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group is small enough to fitness apply apply that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there\nIn the closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phone and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Ferris says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nA while in our one by we heard noises\nThe quiet um had had the flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police have said this is a please send you went in here and then there was I kind of like a pause and and they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure\nI'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that in training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooter saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise]\nWhat's that told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\n'em for her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grades she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\n\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class [noise] now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this\nAbout ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom\nAnd training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like tapering over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings\nConsumes I talked to said no to that too I\nCodes and all I I\nIf I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the pool [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision\nAnd told her to actually curse how sheets didn't or doorway grabbing a dozens of scared student [noise] I'm a rose up right\nFrom her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling and kids\nThe problem with that and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes one thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded in your door\nBasically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door\nBut most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull those kids in her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how an investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything [noise]\nAllowed her to know about Barrett heating\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because it's a thing to reckon with [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about dumped the codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I as a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\nOf\nYear at Douglas there are new Gates's new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff\nHe can nice the rats [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] okay [laughter]\nRaised with me [laughter] [noise]\nAfter a few minutes he's got his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops you want to take action somehow\nAnd then had suddenly switches gears starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know and the viruses going on in this world [noise] picking goes away it's not going to share serves because stress for your drug stores are still able to hit and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year develop those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks I personally by\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shoving match was about to start until ...\nOut to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... or ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous\nAfter that Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail cell hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nI'm from ah [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again\nThe answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse find called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screening just\n[noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background\nPanic and he said um there's been a shooting site what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took to never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a law he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that made another Seventy people were injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook were twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there\nSaid he said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they\nFelt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know and I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what made it look like five months ago\nWith that look like\nThey're hanging on to each other all day thing frying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so\nWas also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis was the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state\nHowever this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light Bloomberg or should they should you know Seamus you were shouldn't you know let me flinch object or you're right I'm not too strict person on there will be they should as we're obsessed with this will you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople you were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\nWhat's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland\nI met them at their house there is something was Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nMitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting ... phone\nCalls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer was giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital that she saw patient who mash next description [noise] by that evening the door it still hasn't are directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in and gets Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we have to find your son and I was just like [noise]\nYeah and I'm\nAt two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from these rooms\nThan their names were called out even walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I thought that he was arrested\nAnd taken if I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second ...\nBody was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries which did not\nOn August says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck and the person that answer the phones\nA look what's the name again is Nicholas cage to swim or other swimmers perfect [noise] I think it meant that there was nothing on his face or its head like he was able to perfect",
