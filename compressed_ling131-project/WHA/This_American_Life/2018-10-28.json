producer in our program for many years and back when he was working here at today's show is a rerun he made a decision to return to his childhood he went searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate and their parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan me and her sitting in the back room telling her about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and stinks I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that\nMen Susan flipping through one of the time my books rock and roll through the decades sixties\nShe has long brown hair she's incredibly skinny\nIt's Nineteen Seventy five she's wearing bell bottom leave us a faded Jean jacket she points to a picture of a bloated man in the powder blue runs them jumpsuit sitting cross legged on a stage before a crowd of women [noise] that's my favorite picture of Elvis she sent\nThis information seems somehow personal an important [noise]\nI mean Susan riding in a car [noise] I'm going through this phase where I'm trying to notice things suddenly pull to stop I start trying to notice the guy in the motorcycle next to us he apparently doesn't want to be another especially by the kill your nine year old staring at him to the passenger window [noise] what are you looking at these near\nA turnaround that face the dashboard did he say something you\nSusan ask what didn't do\nNothing or he didn't say anything it's fine look green like tell me what he said what did he say to you I stay silent [noise]\nI Know if I tell her what he said she'll get out of the car truck ... which scares me the comforts me to\n\nAsk\nSusan Jordan was our babysitter [noise] she watched my sister and me every day after school\nWe didn't know any adults like we loved the summer before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place was packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and this isn't Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I checked them through as well as I possibly can I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has made some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nAnd tell her to hold on I'm trying to get my break we can catch up\nShe says great steps aside\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nI keep Glenn thing behind Susan making project gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at me\nFind links to test me on the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at two or three for two more years I never cynicism toward America\nOr\nOr\nWhat drives me crazy but I never saw arrogant [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care\nBut somehow having her play what to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it'd be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten them [noise]\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things\nAbout me I just had to find her\n\n\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers but I Know\nI'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling I Do I Do you remember she was in Jordan right\nGeorge\nGeorge springing up out but I Can't I\nUh she was our babysitter oh OK chicken like my pet\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I wanted to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really add more of a relationship with you and she said she seemed to\nAnd it was really it was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded\nWell how's desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean that people are complicated now what I really wanted to do would spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy to know a lotta times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably thought what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it see sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise] oh\n\nEvery time the subject for hard times came up\nI hear a subtle hesitancy and to enjoy\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly no\nIt wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that had been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was too kind back then because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family\nAnd that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but uh\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but I\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ...\nYou're for life that I remember\nIs he or she just as soon forgot [noise]\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like but\nDidn't think of myself as where it all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentlest terms possible\nWhen I was nine I was anxious and bookish\nNot just the missing and all that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like there were mostly folks more educational thing\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that cake had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite at play full as other kids that I have not just in more serious than general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\n\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship [noise] she said she must be remembered the side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keep people lived differently than the way I live and that's what I decided I wanted from I Know\n\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recordings [noise]\nOr you can find someone who knew back then [noise] someone you haven't seen since [noise] they still carry with them themselves in the picture of do this on clouded by the years in between\nThe remember you better than you remember yourself\nAnd you can do the same thing for them [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n... he did that story back when he was a producer here at a show now even pod casting company called gimme media and he's the host pod cast without fail ...\nHunker gray flannel suit [noise]\nFor a long time David filled with the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in Beverly Hills as you might imagine in Beverly Hills

really big commercial success but there were respected known in the history of punk by people who care about that kind of thing\nA few years back there not series of connections he ended up revisiting his teenage years for the first time but going back on tour in a version of his band in Japan here's that's something that happens\nI mentioned it to a client\nAnd I said well you know I played in um in the ... when I when I was a kitten and or if you're not really interested in and then the next day he sent me a copy of over ...\nAnd I said before so it was and I watched his what can I watched the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize wait a minute [laughter]\n\nSit down to brass tacks or how much we I think that one actually went to forty eight dollars\nI particularly like looking at you know all that sort of uh\nOther groups that were going and twenty five cents [noise] um [noise]\nYou know music business or offerings along punk lines or that you know I don't want to live on nonsense at the time and it was good to see that uh [noise]\nYou know that as their their ... value if he or she later I mean it was it was found that history

good boy [laughter]\n\n\nSo ah we whenever they want the October sick I took my wife [noise]\nWhich possibly with a ... was a miscalculation but [laughter] no it's a good thing to take my wife is a are you you're approached by dozens of teenage girls I was getting stumped on the street so what happened the first time you went on stage well there was just you know the announcement the light [noise]\nRecently Adam Davidson and occasional contributor to our program found his old high school diaries\nAdams mama's Israeli status American and grew up in New York [noise] his body was in New York [noise] his brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely [noise]\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise] that it was very clear to me that\nThis was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel and [laughter] I mean [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for\nHistory for people to know the deep thoughts of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to meet his nation [noise]\nOr or regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp\nThat was right before I started writing this\nDiary greatly me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing if the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude seconds me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes out of them was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nInteresting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] no that's a that's a kind of amazing\nWorld jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say\nIf he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] like amazing that you're in the prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably the trailer funds recite that at some point or the ball game or something in that sense right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but\nI don't know I mean it was like maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life\n[laughter] I Know you just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course if all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your\nActions won't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation\nYou know just to have your petty little craft and you're petting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nYou would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nYou'd be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this rating appease\nIt would seem like it's settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get on to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like stories from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make a bully sound like story on our show\nIs history about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people\nTo watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nMy friend's got with the top half\n[noise] it was beginning of the school year and we were\nUm [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] I guess basically got up on a on the phone back and they started yelling and screaming about\nHow he was magnificent he was and I think actually right after that I might have gotten that far back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord have thought that was pretty amazing\n\n'cause I bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good out of me thinking along [laughter] killer path\n\nTalked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class\nHe saw signs all over campus that set in both pretty\nI Am nine feet tall\nThe giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who put them up\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nScott decided he would go to the cloud specified time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nGiant man a booming voice\nProbably even know exactly with something like you know I'm trying to get out loud but just kind of weird [noise] you know sort of [noise]\nThing [laughter] way way way though I don't know and\n\nGot asked his college friend who does actors giant man's leg\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nAnd a black really way like the guy I think\nWe have a point in the bushes hold on and I um [noise] because I really couldn't see what was going on out of the crowd and for the hockey game and I got on the shoulder effects way of like around my waist and we walked out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Madison",
