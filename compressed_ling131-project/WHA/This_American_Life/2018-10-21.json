Hi I'm actually in room eleven thirty day can you hear me can you hear me [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except every now and then turn just laughed to herself\n[noise]\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds from forty four seconds and then when the recording you're here [laughter] [noise]\nNo and then she tries to door handle again thinking she told me later you know this can really be true like the cat just got to be with us going to work\nOne wall because it had the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car locks up in she hears people she hears some German tourists\nWalking towards her down the hall and fortunately she actually has the skills\nFor this very situation [noise]\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for a little bit\nAnd then they do nothing\n[laughter]\nHer husband's out on a dish and he's also a singer and it's from it's turned off she takes her mom there's nothing bad\nShe finds her mom and ready then somebody taps on the door the hotel room and close the ... are you okay\nCan you come to the door the person asks [noise]\nOh [noise] [laughter]\n\nOh my gosh current news is really weird thing to say to somebody as you're getting less clear\nCouldn't help herself nobody wants to look like I'm not you know [noise]\nThat'd be the Germans when they found this very sweet Jamaican housekeeper and twenty two minutes after cameras locked in the housekeeper set her free\nGod I was so happy to see her and she was so nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI Know this is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that [laughter]\nI don't know I didn't think of it then\nParent remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about the spectacle you know it's eighty people from the stage and horses and of vengeance and big grand feeling the was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in space not much bigger than your body it is\nThere's literally no movement in the spot if someone would just age this as an opera how would that go [laughter] [noise]\nUm [noise] it might be minimalist music actually [noise] uh right [noise]\nLike just repeating beam over and over and over again\nWith me yelling help [noise]\nAnd the people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I put the quarter to be under the story and make sure that sending put a little funky music on driven maybe you've heard our show [noise]\nBut when we did this interview like\nThree or four weeks ago I wrote a witness for once in my life I don't have to let the story
