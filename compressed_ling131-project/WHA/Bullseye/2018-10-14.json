[noise]\n\nComing up\nWe'll talk to Sarah Jessica Parker about her role starring in the HBO series divorce she'll tell me about where she got the inspiration for shows Tom\nSeventies cinema was the central inspiration from me I mean that's what I kept surfing around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around that you know all the great movie from the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play it's really important role\nBut I imagine that fat music with music as separate young people they fell in love to you know\nThen later ... we'll talk with him about his one man show career suicide you also tell me why she thinks there's no worse fate for a common\nThing being just okay what a fall on my face for people to watch me get caught I

for middle\nAge it's all coming up on both sides let's go [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse born in a resume that has spent decades Sarah Jessica Parker has performed some of the most compelling characters in TV and film\nShe kicked off her career adjust Fifteen starring on the CBS teenage comedy square pegs from there she appeared in movies like footloose LA Story and hocus pocus and there's also some show called sex and the city no big deal\nWhen I talked with her a couple of years ago she just launched another new show on HBO it's called divorce its second season wrapped up earlier this year they're working on a third one no\nIt's a drama to it that talks about the end of a marriage and the wreckage and birth that you find in its wake\nSarah plays Francis a corporate recruiter who's been with her husband Robert played by Thomas Hayden church for Seventeen years church and Parker don't really want to call it chemistry since they're splitting up on the show but there is something compelling about the way they interact on screen\nThe series takes on topics like commitment fidelity even finances in a very\nHere's a little bit from the first season of divorce and missing from the show's pilot Francis gives her husband venues\nYou spent last Christmas fishing in Alaska\nNow hang on a second that's the only time of the year that the Chinook salmon run in those numbers and you said you didn't mind\nI didn't mind\nIt was the best Christmas I have had in years You're welcome sometimes I come home from work and I'm happy [noise]\nActually feel happy\nAnd then I see your car their part that I realized your home\nThink [noise]\nYou know my own job is and what this is the I Want to save my life while I still care about it\nI don't love you anymore\n\nOn a divorce\nSarah Jessica Parker welcome to both say\nThank you thank you so much for having me\nAre you want to ask you something I'm a serious to begin with which is I just experience or a couple of years ago where a a pair of good friends of myself and my wife a split up they were married\nAnd um my my own parents were divorced when I was very young and I you know I always thought it was for the better I mean they didn't get along um but when these friends of mine were splitting up\nOr I sort of freaked out\n[laughter] I was really legitimately freaking out about it these people live three thousand miles from me [laughter] I care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right\nAnd uh it ... it occurred to me like how intense\nI just I guess I just never acts I just walled off that part of my ... my life experience mhm and the wall just crumbled all in one go [laughter] mhm\nUm and I wonder what it's like for you to live with the way that you live with this subject when you're making a TV show\nLive with divorce you know every day when you go to the office\nI'm the experiences I'm not I'm not a personal exploration for me you know in terms of trying to sort out my own home life but rather\nI guess in some ways what you've described as witnessing your friends marriage fell apart you know for me\nIt's a fascinating way to spend a lot of hours because\nI I guess you know the reason that I was interested in it initially and developing the show was because I I I like yourself I was watching friends marriage a fall apart I was witnessing friends um contemplate affairs\nFriends have affairs marriage survives affairs marriage be better for having ... having one party I have an affair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorced and all those things that surround\nUm surround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubstantive relationships and I liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the town that I was hoping for because it's for some it's devastating for others it's I'm an opportunity to sort of um\nAnd I think it's really complex I think people's reactions to divorce when it's not their own are really often surprising to themselves\nDoes it does it freak you out I mean the ... like ways when you spend time with it in your heart do you do you feel freaked out and I don't mean like in the sense like or does it make you feel like a a you and your husband are going to get divorced\nUm but like it's it's like an exit central dread for\nMe [laughter] [noise] I think I think it doesn't freak me out sometimes\nIt makes me very sad um and I'm I'm I don't know I'm not I'm not freaked out by it because it's\nBoth an artistic an academic exercise in some ways and for me I guess I've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children and up the active household and chaos and um I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um\nPenetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I loved the story I like\nPushing on the bruised I I've always been that way and\nUm I I'm\nMuch more interested in the potential to be freaked out than not\nI Want to play a pushing on the bruise scene from divorced so ah your character whose name is Francis is a head hunter\nAnd this is the this is the cold open ... of the third episode and she's sitting down with a client who's looking for a new gig 'em and they have this conversation\nBut never thought I'd be the kind of got to use the head\nI don't want to know what's out there for\nOkay uh what are you looking for I'm not sure\nSomething of this job for twenty plus years [laughter] just the same thing over and over and over and over again I'm not getting any younger goalie crazy but I Want a new challenge [noise]\nAnd me NPR wind club where members receive NPR

Jeffrey for my guest is Sarah Jessica Parker we talked in twenty sixteen she is of course the stars sex in the city she's also been in films including LA Story footloose and the first wives club she's currently starring in the HBO show divorce your husband is a actor Matthew Broderick\nDid you have a relationship with his work before you knew him as a human being like I mean like I'm not I'm not telling you if you don't know but like he was first view it for example\nI'm not only did I have a relationship with his work but before\nI met him um I when I met him I realized wow I've paid for all your movies [laughter] meaning as an audience I couldn't say that about a lot I can say about Woody Allen's movies from the time I was young child the always went to see Woody Allen movies [noise]\nUm and when I was in Utah shooting footloose that summer I think ... maybe two movies out and I didn't have a car\nBut all my days off I Would go to the movies one or two of which were Matthew Broderick movies so yeah I was very familiar with him I as a as a performer as an actor\nI look I'm a I think that um\nAny relationship is ... including a relationship between two very famous people as the two of you are a is about like just regular people you know like I've done this job long enough to know that like everybody is is a person you know find a point on it but what people are you know human beings\nAre what are the same time I do like the idea that there was some part of you like the first time you and your husband made out or whatever [laughter] where you are less just making out with Matthew Broderick\nOf course yeah I've never shared that the things that you are you there was so ... um yeah I mean I I I thought he was I mean there was a reason I kept paying to see him um yeah so when we started dating um we met\nThrough um friends in the theater he was on the brothers and Matthew and\nMatthew best friend founded the theater company called naked angels and I'd be hanging around there and um that's how we met and up for sure part of that was I'd seen that in on a big screen and liked what I saw\nUm\nAh how do you feel about Thomas feeding churches distinctive mustache show divorce\n[noise] um I like it very much I'm I'm I'm so glad that\nHas become a the six character on the show [laughter] um [laughter] and um it's\nBeen a wonderful conversation ... [laughter]\nI ... I since I had a whole conversation wheelchair and Oregon on the shoulder in London a couple of months ago a tree and I had an extensive conversation about backstage I Am ready to make out with them\nWith like a I think he looks so heads of wood that moustache me too I think it's so great and it's so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly like dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous\nAlready perfect way if it is that really helps define that character who has those qualities\nAt top totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show and in fact earlier than that I started thinking about\nWhat I Hope this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I Want it the music to look like and the costumes and\nSeventies cinema played\nWas the central ... inspiration for me I mean that's what I kept circling around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies in the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play a really important role um but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love\nTo you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will skiing all the great costume designers and and said this moustache\nWas part it fits so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter]\nI Love the sound in it so if I could have been anybody of a certain age group or who is interested in music would have a reaction not just to that obviously to the source music but to compose music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was\nIt so beautifully fit into these ideas\nWell Sarah Jessica Parker uh I'm I'm Out of time with you but I'm so grateful that or you came in to talk to us uh I really appreciate you taking the time\nOh it's been such a treat and you just did not let me down at all and you asked such good\nSmart interesting questions and it's been a real privilege to have time with you so thank you so much [noise]\nSarah Jessica Parker you can currently watching the first two seasons of divorce on HBO Now and HBO Go\nShe's also starring in and producing a new movie called here and now that said theaters them or not [noise]\nJesse born my next guest is Chris gathered Chris was of course the host of the legendary Chris gathered show it aired first on New York city public access television then later on the network fusion you might have also seen him on broad city or you don't think twice they were big we're improv movie\nChristmas also stand up and when we talk you're going to really interesting special it's called career suicide it's kind of a one man show gathered produced it would Judd Apatow to genuinely moving special got their talks very specifically about alcoholism about depression\nHuman very identifiable very funny\nOf course has a new book coming out it's called lose well and it's sort of a self help book\nHe talks about the lessons that he's learned in life shortcomings and successes in show business stories of family and friends and there's even a section on his high school band the lesson if you really want to be good at anything you're going to fail\nAnd if you want to do the right way to fail Chris gathered has some advice anyway let's take a listen to a little bit from the one man show here she's talking about his early days in show business running from audition to audition to get bit parts in commercials [noise]\nGet accurate I start getting acting work I'm getting mostly commercials mostly commercials if you search my name on YouTube to this day you go deep enough and the searching all you can still find it very annoying commercial for H R Block where I where later allergy\nI once audition price subway sandwich commercial to play the role all man who is on attractive to women [noise]\nCharacter named in this\nI couldn't even call them or something like [noise]\nI didn't book that part I'm assuming because [noise]\nChris gathered walking back to ... it's good to see a great to see you too so\nYour new special or one man show or whatever you want to call it was called career suicide it's largely about your mental health do you feel exhausted by talking about\nHim [laughter] you know what I mean one hundred percent yeah one of the great things about the special coming out is that maybe I can talk about I can stop [laughter] everything I have to say about it in in that special and when I get asked about it I can just\nTell people you know find it out all your uh HBO driven streaming platforms from work because that's really what I have to say about it because it has been many years of talking about it in some form or another and and definitely it's exhausting and doing the show more exhausting than I thought\nFor sure it feels like part of what you're doing in the special and also in your memoir which was the last time you were on the show I think is in writing about him performing about it you are talking yourself into engaging with it fully\nI think that's a very astute observation I think there's like definitely a part of me that knows that if it's not hit and it has less power over me if it's not something I'm trying to\nYou're listening to ... I'm Jesse for my guest Chris ... is a comedian and the star of the one man show career suicide which is washable now on HBO he's also the author of the new book lose well which has bookstores October sixteenth we talked last year one of the things you talked\nAbout in your special show\nFor suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to your career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be a Russian lawyer healthy because of that yeah\nUm two part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that\nThe second part is do you think you would feel comfortable doing work in your career that was good work but not\nCapital G. capital W good works you know what I mean like just if you were like if you got cast on as the second guy in a funny sitcom and you were doing a good job of that yeah and the sitcom wasn't evil but neither was it a place for teenagers and come\nRight right it was a it wasn't A Guided by this sense of urgency or a\nChip on his shoulder that might work clearly has now at like ... I'm definitely a workaholic its problems\nIt's probably like one of the biggest things is still wrap my head around is that I get called too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go away tomorrow which could getting better about that you know have a little bit for stability\nAnd they've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can just get one of those big jobs everybody have to notice it and\nSo I have to admit that I was right going for this and so I have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of ... in a cop to the fact is\nThat there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on it's I actually wants witnessed that ask cat New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member Knesset now talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get with my next gig ... might have to move across the country\nWas figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy you're on the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back and have proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out I have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems\nAs far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoyed if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say some of the stuff I've done\nI don't know like I mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest show great shows more funding they send their children there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of us about some other yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride one of my favorite shows of all time course\nBut it doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something they're going to have their mission statement of trying to like break the system and he came back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know but I I think hard about it because there's a there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know always doubting by integrity or my indie credibility at this point like I think anyone who knows\nMy work would say that guy spent years bending over backwards to try to do this thing and at times he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people's fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I couldn't move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel out of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up accomplishing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work\nAnd I'm not quite there yet but I Would love to be because I feel like one of the things I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago when nobody\nWas particularly interested in the hat to just kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians court in that spot and help them do not have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen so that's another thing is like\nMaybe if I was the one of those bigger jobs that could give me that credibility and that could bring some other stuff into the world but who knows I don't know I'll sell out some day everybody to us right [noise]\nIt's ... I'm Jesse for I'm Talking with the comedian Chris gathered about his special career suicide you can watch it on HBO Now\nFriend of mine was telling me this past week it has a friend who sold the company for sixty five million dollars and he said this to me as a kind of warnings and my friends told his company for sixty five million dollars not only does is make bad art and I was like the dream make bad art yeah I mean\nThat's already make it better than had been doing for years yeah [laughter] not really getting paid that well for him yeah certainly don't have sixty five million dollars [laughter] I don't have to find a market for my bad art that's perfect\nYeah it is funny they're talking about the idea of moving on its you know the gathered show when I talk about the gathered show for years that has been my people and they're still my people\nTheir punk kids they're ... they're artists a lot of them are clear a lot of them are doing things their own way you know a lot of them either by choice or by necessity or people have walked their own path\nPeople walk there aren't that it's a beautiful thing I'm very very proud of it those are my people but it's funny they are so why is that like I get the sense\nOnline sometimes I'm really in tune with these people this past week I was in a fight with my own family club on my they banned they shut they stopped comments on my post and the Facebook group that's my fan club to get the ads and I was obviously mad about it and they were like we don't care where shutting down like I have this contentious relationship\nAnd I get the sense sometimes that like\nThey are such underground people and so passionate about the values of that\nDebt me being in ... his movie is a little bit of a sellout [laughter] beautiful anonymous pod a pod cast they're like you're getting a little too mainstream for us buddy and there's almost like a counter cultural element to the gathered show\nWhere I have to grow and I have to evolve\nAnd I'm In ... it's a very fascinating thing to realize I don't know if they want me to and that's a very odd feeling very odd feeling I can feel them being happy for it but I can also feel can feel a lot of my older school fans feeling like man like he's really\nHe's really growing up and moving on and I don't know exactly how to handle that 'cause I feel like that's what I've always been working towards this trying to get a better head on my shoulders it's weird I don't know how to go\nI'm heading you know especially thinking about H. B. O. like that's a more a bigger platform than I've ever had your ... name before you're yeah so the copier credits pretty fancy stuff how much longer can I claim to be this rebel try to ah throw rocks from the outside the house you know\nI don't know how much longer people are going to buy that but I don't really know what else I Am\nAre you worried that you're not going to get that some might show and you're going to have to move to CBS andme enlarge the ban\nMy God that was a bigger theatre [laughter] follow that man's life I Would be very often\nI don't know I just read a biography of Batman yeah life's not horrible but\nI can only talk about what I what I witnessed as a consumer of pop culture all ready to the junior senator yeah most brilliant out of oxygen as a kid it seemed thrilled about no fires the things we read about the actual um loneliness that doesn't seem great\nBut I I think a lot of that if he would be proud of the crews gathered show that's like a major concern of mine is like if footage of this ever went across David Letterman's desk\nWould he be sites because in my mind\nA lot of what's behind it is\nNot talking bad about anybody but late night just used to be a lot weirder I think it just used to be weirder he was weird cone instills weird even Carson had a lot of weird stuff on there\nUsed to be this element to it where it would get a little chaotic unpredictable and now in my opinion seems much more controlled and that's okay but I Want my show it to be an hour of just that\nLetterman you sometimes to like get a permit to shut down the block so he could pour ten thousand rubber balls off the roof of his duty onto the street and that was it no thought about it beyond that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bullseye", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
