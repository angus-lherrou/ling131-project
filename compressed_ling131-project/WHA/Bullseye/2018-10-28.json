[laughter]\nSo um we were trying to think of wants to do and I I just said well we should end with the song you know she'll be like a cherry ... you know a lot but looking on the bright side because it's it's terribly ironic to call and I should look on the bright side when you are being crucified there's not a lot to look forward to [laughter] so it is a sort of\nOptimism in the in the context of the movie but seems to be adopted it very allergy just got my eyes\nI talk about beginnings for a second I didn't know much about the circumstances of your early life can you tell me about how you came to ship off to boarding school fulltime\nWell I was a it was I was born in the world war two and a [noise]\nUh the end of World War two Ninety five my father was still in the hour if he'd been since Nineteen forty one and they told everybody hitchhike home for for the holidays and\nHe got a ride and he was in the truck which rubbed off the road and loaded crushed him and he actually died in hospital on Christmas Eve which is a kind of supporting it seemed running but\nUm I was only two and a half so it's not something that I experienced afterwards and through the absence of my mother's in extraordinary grief in reaction to that I think she disappeared into a depression for a while\nUm and then you know she she uh she got back [laughter] and ah ... then I I think I went to school in the other side of the ...\nThen it was too much I Know I was about seven and an unruly seven year old boy if you're trying to keep a fulltime job is in us but she was\nSo the the R.

I was like um\nWhat's that lived in ... the Victorians when the ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I like the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIs the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you say will be your\nLast shows [laughter] um and you know you just write your memoir like you're in you're in looking back mode right do you still look forward\nTo to still make the kinds of plants that you made ten years ago or Twenty years ago or fifty years ago\nNo I mainly wants us to read the books and [laughter] they're like a child you know [laughter] but um we can't do it again because sadly Terry Jones is not able to do it again and then so that's just a few of us left able and it wouldn't be the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well\nWe have a little we may have some surprises up our sleeves but um it will be certainly not us particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it um [noise]\nYou know ... fifty it's it's not our anniversary as somebody asked his wedding anniversary it's a very strange one but I thought I Would write my book because I knew I'd be questions so I wanted to see what I could remember while I still haven't forgotten\nDo you think of it all differently now than you did Twenty years ago or even like I'm Talking about after the movies were made and so on and so forth but still a long time ago\nVery long time ago and it it just it's amazing to me because it just seems to get bigger I mean it doesn't seem to pass away becomes more they're going to be in the end you just you know well what can you do\nYou embrace it enjoy it and be grateful for all those wonderful people that you met along the way and all the many left we were doing comedy so we have those on a bloody laptops and that's really writes\nEric I'm so grateful that you came here to be on both sides real honor to have you on the show and thank you for that and pay thanks very are amazing work that's meant so much to me in so many people show my pleasure thank you for reading the book [laughter] I did it through\nA whole whole Eric\nIdle a real life Monty Python member is new book always look on the bright side of life in bookstores now and go check it out I mean\nProbably found the greatest comedy group the English language has ever known a but I Will say one of my favorite little Eric Idle performance is is it a sketch called the ... brothers I'm sure you can find it now that ball pythons on Netflix and drink and find it on Web sites that play videos\nToo but ah yeah just Google the ... and you'll be glad you did [noise]\nIt's ...
