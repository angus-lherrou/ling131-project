[noise] it's harvest season ramps up we learn how Wisconsin drivers can safely share the roads with an increasing number of large slow moving tractors and farm equipment\n... is a ... safety expert for the W Center for agricultural safety and health\nAnd she joins me this morning as we talk about this issue Cheryl good morning\nGetting learning so it's harvest time uh talk about the kinds of equipment we typically see hitting the road this time of the year\nHe'll be seen a variety of farm equipment on taking out to the road from\nOur typical farm tractors and wagons to the larger combine 'em that will be harvesting or corn or soybeans I'm at the same time we have some you know all their equipment that's\nStill out there so you might still see some of the the smaller killed behind corn pickers ...\nEnds up a whole variety you know even potato harvest stores here in the state\nSo there's just a lot more of this kind of traffic this time of the year which makes perfect sense this is when they have to get the crops and\nSo ah how often do we see accidents involving farming equipment and the other vehicles at harvest time\nYou know the motor vehicles farm\nEquipment crashes aren't the significant motor vehicle crashes but we do have them happen and typically when they happen it results in a fatality to the motorist um or very severe injuries to to the motorist\nAnd especially if it's someone on a motorcycle out there because if you look at the size of our cars are pickup tracks a motorcycle um you know when you crash\nInto this this farm equipment it's bigger it's heavier and you just don't have the a lot of protection in those crashes\nGood morning\nSheera let's start with you the Milwaukee film festival is highlighting a female directors this year with almost half the films are featuring being directed by women and that some of last year was a little under a third of the films oh why did you decide to make that the focus this year\n\nWell that's a really great question it's it's been a challenge within the film industry as a whole lot to ensure that\nWomen get an equal voice and equal place within programming and it was a very important initiative actually started by my colleague Cara a that she put out to our programming so I'll let her uh add up to that commentary yeah 'cause\nI mean it really came about pretty naturally uh you know looking at our numbers that a lot of conversation around gender parity within the film festival industry which is an industry if you believe it [noise] um we were a little disappointed so um I sort of early on issued a challenge to programmers to say hey take the consideration\nAs you're making your way through the research that you're doing and let's see what comes to that um\nAnd we're pretty pleased with those results obviously industry why there's a long way to go in terms of equity for women in leadership roles equity for women are having access\nTo the funds to make the films to tell the stories that audiences want to hear but we hope that by our audience as coming and seeing these great films that that will help prove to the folks who make those decisions that these are folks want to face\nWill care as long as you're talking here keep it up on what ah what films are you most excited about\nI'm going to sort of specifically with in that genre of film I guess a sort of thinking about some of the films that are directed by women uh one of the fellas I'm pretty excited about that I actually haven't gotten a chance to see yet\nProgramming director don't always see all the movies but one of our programmers are on the cell and it's gotten a lot of critical praise I'm hoping his takeaway in theater and the U.S a call to keep the change in our American independence program\nAnd it tells the story that you know romantic comedy sort of drawn a scenario of\nAdults on the opposite spectrum that are exploring dating app check relationships comedy uh the trailer is definitely one of my favorites are really compelling\nAnd we're actually doing a panel uh after one of those screenings featuring some adults who have living out on the on the spectrum talking about how they respond to about much should be a pretty cool experience\nAnd it will come back to the film a bit to one of the female directed films though you're featuring this year is a virtual reality film and we have a little bit of the trailer list\nEvery day [noise]\nThis is a this was a documentary bully watch this movie about ...\nYeah so the sunlight is is the mention of the our\nDocumentary and I that's a little bit newfangled right so we are virtual reality as part of a gallery at our festival where audiences can come in put on a headset\nAnd immerse them solving stories so one of the stories is in the sun lady a documentary about a group of female fighter sort of taking on ISIS uh they're actually from the ... a community and\nThe women escaped and began the female only fighting unit called the ... as you heard in the in the clip their one of the unique things that that uh I Do is to me um ISIS believes that if you were killed by a woman you\nGo to hell apparently and so this was a particularly powerful moment for a sort of activating\nThe cars to sort of fight back on the half of their people\nAnd the virtual reality will ah will certainly be an attraction for people who are really really interested in technology\nThat we're talking about the uh the Milwaukee film festival with pure or burn and Sarah meaning and with you if you'd like to join us at eight hundred six four to one two three four if you're going to the festival which films are you interested in\nGive us a call and let us know eight hundred six four to one two three four ... another film directed by a woman at the festival this year is called zero weeks about pay leaving the United states and we have a clip from that let's listen to it\nMany folks have expectations and the government guaranteeing them paid time off when they have a family emergency and that's not the case\nWent to work every day and then on my lunch break and radiation and went back to where\nI Am working on\nMy dad had leukemia ... might not have a job will come back I found myself sitting in a cubicle at work while nine nine and I'm going I'm going to fight in red wine coming\nHere to tell us why we should come and see this documentary\nSays there weeks which has directed by Chicago based filmmaker hijacking a is an incredibly insight says a story about\nHow paid leave affects all Americans and how our lack of access to it um\nIt really is a challenge but it's a really unique to the United states you know to the United states is one of 'em at least to a westernized countries are are globally a powerful countries that don't have\nA significant pay plead as part of the governmental policy hasn't really explores how that affects everybody right I think a lot of people may think of this as a witness\nIssue but it isn't you hear in that trailer um you know a man who was talking about his child but it affects people with aging parents are people who has a diseases that require treatment of it as you hear in that trailer really kind of affecting lots of people\nAnd sort of digging into what what might be a reason for making that kind of change on a broader level\nAnd we we're trying to talk about another or one of the female directed films are showcasing this year so let's hear a clip from the movie keep the change\nIn my girlfriends your girlfriend goes\nLike this is part of her name she also\nDon't expect anything [laughter]\nSo tell us more about this film a camera so it it you know as you hear there there's a bit of comedy there's a bit of light hearted nuts but really sort of helping the characters on screen that are really\nRecognizable above all I'm as at many of us have navigated the world of dating relationships and trying to get to know somebody uh I think you see all that play out on screen with a light touch 'em and some recognizable actors\nTo tell us about the recognizable actors [laughter] well\nHere's where I Will admit my a lack of familiarity with actor name but the the actress who plays a we feel blew a on a ... on on TV is in this film as well playing another mother a little bit different of a mother\nNo kidding well there's a there's a there's an attraction shouldn't have a ... we're going to mention is again a throughout the program but Sarah what where can we go online to find more information about the the films and the festival itself\nWe would love it if everyone wanted to learn about all three hundred and eight films by going to end Katie film dot org\nYou can find a full on line programs\nSchedule there and learn a lot about many uh basically every film that we have programs but it'll also give you a ton of information about the locations where the films are being shown and where\nThe parties in events are taking place a lot of people obviously show up the film festivals to see the film but there are a lot of conversations and the parties in celebration that surround\nUm you know what what we learn and how we feel about the films we saw so it it wouldn't be a festival we didn't have parties and conversation than forums to discuss what we all just stop together\nSo how does this a forum or how does this festival compared to other festivals that someone might go to cross country\nThat's an interesting question um you know I'll make a comment\nAnd then I'll at all I care add on to it as well you know when some people think of film festivals they think of you know Sundance Film festival or you know Toronto film festival there's a you know a small group of international film festivals in film festival in general where\nMajor uh Hollywood films and independent uh you know\nFilms make their premieres are and some of the largest film festivals are in that category Milwaukee film festival is unique in that\nWe have a selection of world premieres in fact I Believe we have H. world premieres taking place during the marquee film festival but we also select from the best of the best of the most recent film festival favorites uh\nSo it really ends up being a very\nWell curated collection of the films that are available up her festival viewing and that makes it easier frankly for people who don't know a lot about them to come and feel comfortable that what they're going to see has been vetted by and that a group of people before them have decided that may have been their favorite\nOkay sure will come back to that and we'll get cares take on this as well um ... Osbourne is program going education director for the Milwaukee film festival ... chief marketing officer for the Milwaukee film festival I'm ... It's MORNING show on the ideas\nAnd we are very committed to and have a lot of support behind the idea of continuing to grow that economic base and continuing to push the viability of the film industry here in uh in our state and in uh the city of Milwaukee\nWe'd go to some callers who want to join the conversation so much welcome Jim who is calling us from Kenosha Jim thanks for joining us on the morning show\nGood morning thank you I'm a big question for the gas\nUm if we wound up work with the directors of the story ... movies and stuff and want to meet interact\nWith them is any chit chat you meet them and the festival or a successful if it were the folk and you want to pose that idea to structure how would you go about doing I think you I'll hang up all of it\nJim thanks for the call so I'm Wondering how much of an opportunity to use their for interaction with the filmmakers\nSo one of the one of the cool things about film festivals in addition to great films and opportunities to talk about the films with others and community is that\nFilm filmmakers attend a the festival we're bringing in a over a hundred and twenty guests from outside of Milwaukee to be here to represent their films to\nEngage in Cuba days after the screenings with audiences um and so there are opportunities to kind of a eat a\nFolks maybe emerging a filmmaker who may eventually have a film coming out of Hollywood that you'll see at a multiplex of big blockbuster but also to really kind of get to know the people who make the work um and so through those two days I'm In a number of factors that we have\nThose are ways to kind of get to know filmmakers better and to um you know sure pitch them an idea and maybe it's something they'd be they'd be interested in sort of discussing further\nOh much will it looks from some more callers joined is eight hundred six four to one\nTo the festival what is it you're looking forward to seeing maybe you've never been a you have a question about something related to the festival we have the two individuals here who are best situated to answer that question eight hundred six four to one two three four\nHundred six four to one two three four ... take a look metaphorically speaking to some more of the films on offer at the festival this year and there are over three hundred of them that's pretty overwhelming so where should festival goers start Kara\nSo we we realize that three hundred film as a lot and that it's kind of overwhelming us so we have the kind of organized into film program categories um and I sort of take that table of contents as one ... tactic\nUh yup ... a program called sound vision which you use like documentaries so if you're looking for an experience that followed and fish and that may be recognizable\nTo you about that that stone jet or am I a a those are opportunities to kind of explore we also have a section called quick fix that you're like I don't know just find me something that'll that'll give me an emotional experience you can go to a something that's probably going to be a jerk or um\nBut I you know and at our this isn't necessarily a popular opinion but I\nFind just getting lost in the program book to be a fun way to sort of explore and find things that are interesting sometimes it's an image or sometimes it's a description of it can take a little more time but if folks are looking for just like what's showing today\nAre going to the website at looking at the schedule that that's another way of kind of selling like water my option tonight\nOr the opening night filmed this year is a documentary called science fair about the most competitive high school science competition in the world and we are here is one of the films subject a science wiz named Robert\nI wanted to the pros I don't know what I Do\nUniversities making deals going on how it's harder than wind over to jail for for the afternoon\nScare or why did you decide on this film for opening night so\nUh I'm laughing a little bit here because Robert is one of the subject with el he's he's going to change the world right where do you watch this on your like this guy he's going to be going somewhere on science fairs documentary it premiered at Sundance earlier much earlier this year um and it's actually co directed by you get ... who's an a Milwaukee native originally and\nHer co director there and foster and it's really comparable to Spellbound um that selling email from a few years ago that we know everybody probably saw\n'em but really following guns future scientists and engineers up kids are actually going to invent something that's probably going to change the world so it's pretty inspiring a it's a great film for opening night because it opens your eyes to gain from around\nThe world and gets you really geared up for the power of creativity and art and science uh\nFor the next Fifteen days of the film festival\nThe film festival isn't all documentaries in art films you also have some movies with big names or let's hear a clip from a ... character in the movie ideal home\n[laughter] and so we're moving in case we couldn't even handle that God coyote problems all\nCare

space of a single generation American views changed on the institution of marriage we also talked about how social change happens\nAnd what we can learn from this case how did you see attitudes about gay marriage change over time what do you make of the generational change that you see when you consider the L GB GQ plus movement and\nWhat do you think we can learn\nFrom this movement about other

the morning show\nThanks very much for having me\nI Want to start with a snapshot in time that you use in your book\nIs June twenty six twenty fifty the Supreme Court has ruled five to four that same sex couples are protected under the fourteenth amendment and cannot be denied the right to marry the change has the support of a sitting president and supporters celebrate even as opponents consider this a symbol of last moral compass\nFor you this was a symbol of how dramatically the U.S has changed and change quickly tell us why\nA study came out not too long ago that showed that the rise and public opinion about gay marriage was literally unprecedented\nA ... in other words no a issue has ever changed so much so quickly\nUm and uh it was ultimately about a generational change in how young Americans\nOf the relations between children parents and grandparents um but there's a broader meaning of generations that refers to uh what social scientists called cohorts\nAnd cohort simply refers to any group of people who goes through an event at the same time I'm most ah people would be familiar with the idea of a birth cohort that is every one born during a certain here\nOr your high school graduating class\nUm and so uh this book is all about generation in that sense of the term how one group of people who grew up in one period of American society thought about homosexuality and gay marriage a differently than the different generations\nSo what are the signs that generational changes president or a factor in in something happening in in our culture\nOr the signs that can come from almost anywhere and that's one of the really interest uh challenges studying generational change\nA generational change can manifest itself and how people talk or it can show up in people's behaviors it can show up in music people like the ways people dress\nHow people vote a and so it's oftentimes difficult to determine what kinds of changes that we see in society are due to a generational change versus what kinds of things are due to other sorts of changes\nLet's take another call here Jessie is with us in Green Bay Jesse good morning thanks for joining us on the morning

their turmoil and all of it\nIs that the Catholic Church and they made me start questioning what is who gets to find what's correlate who decides what question at\nOkay to homosexuality is they are going to how are you really like allowing by\nOh can you can't and if there are limits to what I wanted and I just wonder if that was kind of a general population you know what will happen or start going okay to reach weakest every phrase\nMoral that this foundation or is it\nJust see thanks for that to things for that insight and ... to ... from college girl because they think these are related and then we can talk about that a depth thanks for joining us on the morning show\nHigh ... um yeah I Want to make a similar comments about um that churches will I get that my attitude is well I got a lot more for progressive church and they're an open and affirming church and basically we just you speak about gay people and it's all about love so it\nYou know their love is the same as any other heterosexual Bob so um I think it's also about the people that you know surround yourself with two and\nThat they're you know everyone in the same and the approach of each other that they\nAre Deb thanks thanks for that uh Peter ... one of the things you said in your book you talk about the research a public opinion research and one of the questions was I think whether homosexuality was a sin or not these two callers\nUh seem to kind of fit in with that talk a little bit about the uh the public opinion research that that you cite in the book and how that shifted a overtime\nSure thing um the single largest a predictor of a person's opinion about same sex marriage is whether or not they believe homosexuality is immoral or not\nA and over time uh those attitudes changed right along with the attitudes about same sex marriage\nUm whether or not\nIs getting into the scandal and the Catholic Church um may have caused people use to change a and what other some of the other sources of change might have been scholars are still debating that right now\nAre so we don't know for sure um what I can tell you is that when I did interviews with a a older generation and younger generation in ah northern Illinois for this book\nI heard stories very much like both those of the callers just now um many people had a variety of different uh experiences with religion and a variety of different religious beliefs\nUm that led them over time to change their minds about the extent to which homosexuality of this and\nUm and uh whether or not same sex marriage is something that is morally supported um people continue to seek out religious guidance and spiritual guidance\nOr on their opinions about this issue and it happens on both sides whether you're supportive or post\nOh let's take another call this time we'll go to Joe in walking showed Joe hello welcome to the morning show\nI heard you I'm yeah I'm a I guess what your guest noted I think has a central meaning I think on this what in other words that\nThe change is not what you do that who you are in other words people who will be going to come out of the you know within families friends um you know so an uncle who you know very well and a brother or sister or even the parents\nUh decide to come out and say well this is who who I Am a where you may have had this one a notion of ah homosexuality or\nL. D. V. D. to people as what they do you begin to see this is who these people who are who I Love how could I be prejudiced against people if you know people have known all my life you know family friends people I'm close to our share with\nAnd that made you know major changes I think as more and more as I said well gee if you teach people come out of the closet and has changed the views of people they know\nJoe thanks so much for that or for that insight to Peter\nJoe's story is the most common story I heard about are the reasons that older Americans change their mind and it also gets to exactly what change happen on during the Nineteen nineties that that started this long a sort of upward march of public support for same sex marriage\nOn the one hand you had a more and more lesbians and gays are coming out to their friends and family and neighbors and co workers and\nJoe described even for Americans who didn't have\nA gay friends or family members though um they started to see representation of lesbians and gays and on prime time TV viewers me remember Allen's coming out in Nineteen Ninety seven was a big t._v. events but at the time and in Nineteen Ninety eight will and grace that they'd be which was the first\nTelevision show that began with a leading gay character\nAnd what do I even for a Americans who didn't have gay friends they started sort of got to know a a gay characters as if they were a friends or family\nWhat can we learn about the role of generational change in social movements from what happened with the gay marriage\n[noise] um we might imagine generational change happening\nIn a number of ways today um that a movement that arose from the Parkland school shooting a this past year\nUm the current controversy surrounding the me too movement or black lives matter regardless of how older Americans are responding to those events\nWe know that young people are reacting to them in a in a different way and in a way that's probably going to be more enduring\nThan the ways that older adults react um what's responsible for generational change ultimately is that some historical event triggers something in the minds of young people in their formative years and those formative experience that have a way of shaping people's worldviews are\nAlmost for life it's not that they don't change when they get older but they tend to be relatively enduring a and so young people growing up during this era I'm are going to think a little bit differently about politics as a result of what's happening and we may not see the effects of those changes for another decade or two\nPeter ... thank you for joining us this morning thank you very much\nPeter Hart brings it is an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and the author of the gay marriage generation how the algae B. Q. movement transformed American culture\nComing up next the rate of pay for private attorneys in Wisconsin who take on public defender cases is forty dollars per hour and that's the lowest in the nation as a result fewer lawyers are accepting public defender cases especially in more rural parts of Wisconsin\nWe talked to the states public defender about efforts to boost the pay for these attorneys\nI'm drawn monsoon you're listening to the morning show on the ideas network\nBut it it is not an efficient way for us to have a have attorneys traveling hundreds of miles for\nJust a handful of cases um is difficult and and again these are attorneys that are willing to take a case of locally so you'll have an attorney down in Milwaukee or ... that'll have\nClients there and then they're rushing up to marathon county and then perhaps over to Lincoln county and it it it just it it is not an efficient way to run our criminal justice system\nAnd I I Would also speculate probably a dangerous thing for me to be doing here but I Would also speculate that these attorneys were coming from five six hours away\nAren't as familiar with the local conditions and the local culture or the local ... version of the legal system as a as local attorneys would be an end that could also be a vote to the detriment of ... and couldn't\nIt certainly could be I Will say I think the court the local court systems um are\nSo happy to have attorneys showing up for these cases of that\nThey are they will be very I'm very helpful to the new attorneys but they're always like you said there are nuances that you may not be familiar with 'em and issues going on and\nYou know programming and everybody's there to help everyone out so it's not like build leaves at least people without that kind of knowledge but it there as you said there's just those basic pieces of information\nThat um that can be can be helpful and again a lot of it's the more nuanced type of um information there's no doubt about that\nShow forty dollars you know are we sort of the lowest rage or in the nation or how far below the ... the average rate of pay across the country is Wisconsin's rate\nI that's a good question um it varies because of the different systems out there uh Wisconsin has had been at forty dollars an hour now since Nineteen Ninety five so I think we could go more on average is usually the average I'm closer to sixty five Seventy dollars an hour nationwide\nUm this county now is ... ... they pay so\n... the Supreme Court has been hearing this issue and they have been a great partners and talking about advocating the need for this right to raise but they are looking\nI'm In the future of of raising county appointments for attorneys at to up to a hundred dollars just to meet the need we have federal opt to a public defender cases that I Believe pay summer where a between a hundred and twenty a hundred and forty dollars an hour or so\nForty dollars a significantly lower than the fact that it has not been raised since Nineteen Ninety five is a significant issue for us\nAnd ... that same attorney would make a in a private ...\nOh I ... you know that those averages very um they can very well a ... ... it could be it could be\nThe it could be all the way up to hundreds of dollars an hour um you know we have an urgent Leila were so significantly less we're not we're not even in the ballpark anymore um and there are a fair number of attorneys I Will say statewide\nThat used to take our cases and they would call it let's say mean someone at pro bono level because what they could get for private private pay was so much significantly higher and they're not even taking these cases anymore because if they're not coming anywhere near to even reaching their overhead costs\nWill it brings us up to this week the troubled county board unanimously passed a resolution I Would urge the state legislature to increase the rates were public defenders to one hundred dollars an hour by twenty twenty\nThat a step in the right direction\nAbsolutely and the counties that on such wonderful partners in this because\nThey have their own appointments that they have to make for certain types of cases outside of our purview and ... what's happening is if we can't find attorneys\n... individuals are sitting in custody and judges will make if they are absolutely have to county appointments and it's significantly higher and that burden us then shifted to the counties when it's my responsibility the state responsibility\nAnd so the counties have been terrific partners no one wants to see somebody sitting in custody who shouldn't be and certainly nobody wants to see someone who should be represented\nI'm not getting the representation that they need and they recognize because we've been working so closely with the justice system and again this is the local judges the court staff and the counties um\nThe the uh work in the involvement the workload is taking to just find sometimes one attorney to take a case and at some point in time does not much more that we can call every attorney um on our list and when they say no we start over again\nUm but especially for conflict cases we must find private council um so they the county boards I Will say and these resolutions it there it's organic it's happening at the local level and recognizing the need their county that's been so that's been wonderful support\nThis wasn't a a new issue you mentioned the rate has been changed since the nineties uh why do you think there has a has been done traction for this issue\nI think priorities I mean I think people are you know we've had a lot of support in um in our criminal justice system and I think it's bipartisan support I think people recognize that presumption of innocence I think people recognize the value of having a strong strong public defense system\nBut this is an issue that I it's not as if we go in and people say worst were against it I think it's worth it falls as a priority and I think this priority level has\nHas ... accelerated I think people are hearing about it not just from me and not just from the public defender's office I think they're hearing about it at their local levels I think they're hearing about it from their judges I think they're hearing about it from I'm from the county is you know now that we have Nineteen Nineteen of these ... on board resolutions now I'm\nA throughout the state and many more are looking at it and I think that's what\nWhat the legislature and the and the governor's office is hearing and I think that's why we're seeing finally some traction in this area and and the need that this is that this is that this is a top priority for not just the public defender's office but for the entire criminal justice system\nOr a Rodrigo retired circuit judge a drinker really echoes what you've been saying Kelly he wrote into say forty dollars an hour makes it hard to find a turning this means the defendants may not get adequate representation cases take longer to resolve because of the shortage of attorneys\nTaking these cases will continue our discussion with Kelly Thompson

increasing number of large slow moving tractors and farm equipment [noise]\nGerald ... is a ... safety expert for the W Center for agricultural safety and health and she joins me this morning as we talk about this issue Cheryl good morning\nGetting learning so ... it's harvest time uh talk about the kinds of equipment we typically see hitting the road this time of the year\n... variety of farm equipment on taking out to the road from our typical farm tractors and ... to the larger combines um that will be a risky in our corn or soybeans\nI'm at the same time we have some you know all their equipment that's still out there so you might still see some of the the smaller killed behind corn pickers\n... a a whole variety you know even potato harvest starts here in the state\nSo there's just a lot more of this kind of traffic this time of the year which makes perfect sense this is when they have to get the crops and so ah how often do we see accidents involving farming equipment and the other vehicles at harvest time\nYou know the motor vehicle firemen quite meant crashes aren't the the significant um motor vehicle crashes but we do have them happen and typically when they happen it results in a fatality\nTo the motorists um or very severe injuries to to the motorist and especially if it's someone on a motorcycle out there because if you looked at the size of our cars are pickup tracks a motorcycle\nUm you know when you crash into this this farm equipment\nUm it it's bigger it's heavier and you just don't have\nSarah let's start with you the Milwaukee film festivals highlighting a female directors this year with almost half the films are featuring being directed by women and that some of last year was a little under a third of the films oh why did you decide to make that the focus this year [noise]\n\nWell that's a really great question and it's it's been a challenge within the film industry as a whole lot to ensure that\nWhen you get an equal voice and equal place within programming and it was a very important initiative actually started by my colleague Kara or that she put out to our programming full so I'll let her I add up to that commentary\nYeah 'cause I mean it really came about pretty naturally uh you know looking at our numbers that a lot of conversation around gender parity within the film festival industry which is an industry if you believe it [noise] um we were a little disappointed so um\nI sort of early on it should've challenged programmers that they have to take that into consideration as you're making your way through the research that you're doing and let's see what comes of that um\nAnd we're pretty pleased with those results obviously industry why there's a long way to go in terms of equity for women in leadership roles equity for women are\nHaving access to the funds to make the films to tell the stories that audiences want to hear well we hope that by our audience as coming and seeing these great films that that will help prove to the folks who make those decisions that these are folks want to face\nWill care as long as you're talking here keep it up a what a what films are you most excited about\nI'm In a sort of specifically with in that genre of film I guess a sort of thinking about some of the films that are directed by women are one of the ... and I'm pretty excited about that I actually haven't gotten a chance\nSee all the movies but one of our programmers are on the cell and it's got a lot of critical praise I'm hoping to take away and theater and the U.S called keep the change in our American independence program and it tells the story you know romantic comedy sort of drama scenario of\nAdults on the oxygen spectrum that are exploring dating app check relationships comedy uh the trailer is definitely one of my favorites are really compelling and we're actually doing a panel uh after one of those screenings featuring some adults who are living\nUp on the on the spectrum talking about how they respond to a film which should be a pretty cool experience\nAnd it will come back to the film a bit to one of the female directed films though you're featuring this year is a virtual reality film and we have a little bit of the trailer let's listen to that\nEvery day [noise]\n\nThis was a this was a documentary believe what's this movie about ...\nYeah so the sunlight is is the mention of ER\nDocumentary and I that's\nA little bit newfangled right so we have virtual reality as part of a gallery at our festival where audiences can come in and\nPut on a headset and immerse themselves at a story and one of the story is in the sun lady a documentary about a group of female fighter sort of taking on ISIS uh they're actually from the ... a community and the women\nEscaped and began the female only fighting unit called the lady that actually hurt in the in the clip their one of the unique things is that a news to me um ISIS believes that if you were killed by a woman you\nGo to help apparently and so this is particularly powerful moment for\nA sort of activating the cars to sort of fight back on the half of their people\nAnd the virtual reality will ah will certainly be an attraction for people who are really really interested in technology\nThat we're talking about the uh the Milwaukee film festival with cure or burn and Sarah meaning and would you if you'd like to join us at eight hundred six four to one two three four if you're going to the festival which films are you interested in\nGive us a call and let us know eight hundred six four to one two three four ... another film directed by a woman at the festival this year is called zero weeks about paid leaving the United states and we have a clip from that let's listen to it\nMany folks have expectations that the government guarantee them paid time off when they have a family emergency and that's not the case\nWent to work every day and then on my lunch break and radiation and went back to where\nI'm working on\nMy dad he had leukemia virus might not have another comeback I found myself sitting in a cubicle at work while my son and I don't know if I didn't read why I'm\nHere to tell us why we should come and see this documentary\nOr weeks which has directed by Chicago based filmmaker high tech and a is an incredibly incisive a story about how paid leave affects all Americans on how a lack of access to it um\nIt really is a challenge that is really unique to the United states the United states is one of\n'em I Believe to a\nWesternized countries are are globally a powerful countries that don't have a significant pay pleaded as part of the governmental policy hasn't really explores how that affects everybody right\nBut it isn't you hear in that trailer um you know a man who is talking about his trial but it affects people with aging parents are people who have a diseases that required treatment of it as you hear in that trailer really kind of affecting lots of people and sort of digging into what\nWhat might be a a reason for making that kind of change on a broader level\nAnd we we're trying to talk about another or one of the female directed films are showcasing this year so let's hear a clip from the movie keep the change\nIn my girlfriend or your girlfriend go\nLet me just part of nature and also the Holocaust bummer\nDon't expect anything [noise]\nSo tell us more about this film a camera so\nIt it you know as you hear there there's a bit of comedy there's a bit of light hearted nuts but really sort of helping the characters on screen that are really recognizable above all I'm as\nAt many of us have navigated the world of dating relationships and trying to get to know somebody uh I think you see all that play out on screen with a light touch 'em and\nSome recognizable actors\nOr tell us about the recognizable actors\n[laughter] well here's where I Will admit my a lack of clarity with actor name but the actress who plays a we feel blew a on a ... on on TV is in this film as well playing another mother a little bit different of a mother\nNo kidding well there's a there's a there's an attraction you know ... ... we're going to mention is again a throughout the program but a ... uh what where can we go online to find more information about the the films and the festival itself\nWe would love it if everyone wanted to learn about all three hundred and eight films by going to end Katie film dot org\nYou can find a full on line programs schedule there and learn a lot about many uh basically every film that we have programs but it'll also give you a ton of information about the locations where the films are being shown\nAnd where the party than events are taking place a lot of people obviously show up\nAt film festivals to see the film but there are a lot of conversation and the parties in celebration that surround um you know what what we learn and how we feel about the film is thought so it it wouldn't be a festival we didn't have parties and conversation than for him to discuss what we all just I think either\nSo how does this a forum or how does this festival compared to other festivals that someone might go to cross the country [noise]\nOh that's an interesting question um you know I'll make a comment and then I'll at all I care add on to it as well you know when some people think of film festivals they think of you know Sundance\nFilm festival or you know Toronto film festival there's a you know a small group of international film festivals in film festival in general where\nMajor uh Hollywood films and independent uh you know\nFilms make their premieres are and some of the largest film festivals are in that category Milwaukee film festival is unique in that\nWe have a selection of world premieres in fact I Believe we have H. world premieres taking place during the ... film festival but we also select from the best of the best of the most recent film festival favorites uh\nSo it really ends up being a very well curated the lax\nUp her festival viewing and that makes it easier frankly for people who don't know a lot about films he'll come and feel comfortable that what they're going to the U.S and vetted a and that a group of people before them at the side of that may have been their favorite\nOkay sure will come back to that and we'll get cares take on this as well um Tara ah Auburn is for running an education director for the Milwaukee film festival ... chief marketing officer for the Milwaukee film festival I'm John ... It's MORNING show on the ideas that\nJust in Milwaukee in the metropolitan area but certainly throughout the state\nAnd we are very committed to and have a lot of support behind the idea of continuing to grow that economic base and continuing to push the viability of the film industry here in uh in our state and in uh the city of Milwaukee\nWe'd go to some callers who want to join the conversation so much welcome Jim who is calling us from Kenosha Jim thanks for joining us on the morning show\nGood morning thank you I'm a big question for the gas to um if we won't network with the directors of the story gliders with movies and stuff\nAnd want to meet interact with them is in each had a chance to meet them and the festival or a couple of origin of folk and you want a full size idea to structure a whole would you go about doing ... thank you I'll hang up\nJim thanks for the call show what how much of an opportunity to use their interaction with the filmmakers so\nOne of the one of the cool things about film festivals in addition to great films and opportunities to talk about the films with others in ...\nUh the festival we're bringing in a over a hundred and twenty gas from outside of\nMilwaukee to be here to represent their films to engage in Cuba days after the screenings with audiences um and so there are opportunities to kind of a eat a folks maybe emerging a filmmaker who may eventually have a film coming out of Hollywood that you'll see at a multiplex the\nBig blockbuster but also to really kind of get to know the people who make the work um and so through those Cuba days I'm In a number of ... that we have\nThe other ways to kind of get to know filmmakers better as to um you know\nSure pitch them an idea and maybe it's something they'd be they'd be interested in sort of discussing further\nOh much a ... term some more callers joined us eight hundred six four to one two three four if you were planning to go to the festival what does that you're looking forward to seeing maybe you've never been a you have a question about something related to the festival\nWe have the two individuals here who are best situated to answer that question eight hundred six four to one two three four\nHundred six four to one two three four ... take a look metaphorically speaking to some more of the films on offer at the festival this year and then there are over three hundred of 'em that's pretty overwhelming so where should festival goers start Kara\n[noise] so we we realize that three hundred film as a lot and that kind of overwhelming
