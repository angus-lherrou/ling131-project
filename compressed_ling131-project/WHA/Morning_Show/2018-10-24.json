ideas network I'm John months what gives milk\nIt's a serious question these days there are dozens of products on the market that call themselves milk but are they that's what we're going to look into this morning on the morning show do you prefer plant based dairy alternatives to milk like\nAlmond milk or soy milk why do you do you notice the difference in the way you feel tell us about that if you prefer dairy milk over plant based alternatives winds back do you think the FDA's moved to consider whether to control which products can or can't call themselves milk\nIs less about helping consumers and more about helping the dairy industry and why is that eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas at WNPR dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings\nScott ranking is a professor of food science and chair of the department at the University of Wisconsin Madison morning Scott I'm welcome to the morning show\nI jog and warning I think for the invitation to speak with your ... uh just show\nSo how does the food and Drug Administration defines milk\n[noise] well that's a good question um [noise] you know in in the uh federal regulations you know they they have the definition of mail that speaks to towards the\nUm University of things including like the health of the animals and and um [noise] uh how it's\nHow it's handled and heat treated that talks about its composition\nAh it also refers to I'm a document called the pasteurized milk ordinance which is nearing five hundred pages long of regulations you know dictating really what you know everything\nAbout the whole process the state of the farm in the state of the milking you know I'm systems or how the milk is handled in truck and processed and labeled et cetera et cetera and so there's [noise]\nSo the FDA looks at it with a very very sort of rigorous set of standards I guess you'd say and I'm at so that you know again if you talk about milk in the U.S that you know it's really dictated by hundreds of pages of regulations\nBut Scott what do we know about why consumers turned to plant based alternatives\n[noise] yeah well um and there are certainly you know I'm a collection of reasons why um [noise] um they may do it\nFor 'em you know reasons I'm so for health reasons for instance um some individuals may have a significant allergies to milk proteins and\nAre you know to them you know it's a function of\nA dairy product or milk you know continue milk proteins that type of thing could have significant health implications\nUm others may be may avoid them for the presence of um of um [noise] I'm of them milk sugar or lactose in other words he may be individuals who have difficulty digesting lactose and\nAnd decide to avoid dairy products because because of that and so so um you know their host of other reasons why they may choose to go for non animal a beverage\nUm um you know they are very legitimate and I think sort of like the the challenges that are\nUm you know if we have all these products that are labeled milk\nSo again I think there are very wise thoughtful reasons why people would avoid the traditional you know animal animal milk milk for instance that you buy at the supermarket [noise] um but I think the the controversy resides well who who can use the term milk though and\nAnd if you apply the term milk to the host of different you know beverages including you know both buy milk and\nA ... of soy and so forth does that you know um does that allow and so the use of milk than mislead individuals into thinking well they're all just milk so I'm just going to consume anyone and there'll be fine\nWell I think the biggest challenges that um you know there there's so many it's such a variety of nutrients um um you know densities in these different products that I think that's where the the the controversy resides um whereas with milk has these\nVery very rigorous standards of how it's made and it's standard of identity and its composition 'em and you know you go to the store any day and you know you well you know you know\nYou will be assured that um that you'll have the same so nutrient density day in and day out and no matter what milk you buy from what manufacturers that all men\nThe non animal melts don't have that sort of structure around them so what are you getting you know I think Dennis is er here earlier callers mentioned to you know read the label and and that's very wise but\nBut if you're not reading labels you know and you just swell and just I Need some milk well you won't be getting the same thing in terms of nutrient density I think that's where the the trouble resides in applying or one of the problems with applying for allowing the use of milk for all these different alternative beverages\nPaul is with those in Washington County Paul welcome to the morning show\nBy and I think this guy is a promoter shelf or the the the growing or the growing areas history ah hey look no such generic term it's\nNot copyrighted sat trademarked and I I'm the editor into the very early got any cause a dairy aisle and you'll see a while ago she will well why don't they call it ... ... ... email or a a goat milk\nOr ... you know that's it for it's a generic term you have to further defined that see you got casual almond milk or we slash ... which I've seen I've tried it's very good\nAnd you do on the outskirts of the nutrients you know what kind of protein or a mineral content uh it's probably better for the environment that you have these uh uh ...\nNot ... not going to a organic digestive system that's polluting the soil in the water ... so I just say\nThe theory industry which has been consolidated and to get like five thousand hurt farmers where they can't even handle the waste material in a responsible manner so my my plan is a somebody's got to tell them that I get over it you have to further define milk\nAren't getting the dairy industry needs to just get over it because these other milks are here and they are milk and that's the dairy farmers of course in producers\nHave big industry groups in their corner pushing to protect their interests or how does how does that play opened a in front of the FDA who's got the who's got the upper hand here\n[noise] yeah no color has a good point in the sense that um you know middle can be applied to a million things and you just need to be a you know allies consumer about what's out there and I guess I'm I'm you know\nSo in terms of animal milks whether it's a you know a cow or sheep or goat or when you go to the store and you buy that gallon\n... there there are very rigid definitions about um how that product comes to be and\nBut if so so good and you go to the store and you buy two percent milk from\nYou know any produced any um process or uh any different brand and and because they all have to abide these regulations you know you're getting the same thing\nIf you go to buy soy milk or almond milk or you know or or another plant based milk you you're not you don't have that insurance so they don't they don't abide with and we were to refer to as a\nStandard of identity so so I'm I'm so again that's where the rub is right so so you get so you go by animal meal could you you're sure that you're getting a product that meets this hundreds of pages of code that say here's how you here's how you make milk\nSo it could come along and say well we're going to put you know I'm I'm a an an ... or a plant based product into this and and and well color red white and and um you know put milk on it too\nWell that's that's where the the ... you know that the difficulty is right and that and that um what are you getting you know and and certainly in ...\nBut I think the FDA at looking at that and\nSaying well you know this term milk you know we already have a definition for it and so and that's how you know Canada and in other countries have\nHave looked at it and say well no no no you can't just say well we're up to you know milk has already been defined and I think that's the that's the sort of basis\nOf the dairy products that are um a tabby Baldwin is is working on and it essentially says that you know where you just want to force the regulations that already exist to say well here's the definition of milk we already have that and the ... ... ... ...\nEspecially excluding the products that are get there through some other route\nWe had a an email from Peter who ah in some reads bird and uh the uh the slogan his email remember the Colorado yo wars here we go again hash tag dairy industry nonsense\nOr Peter points out that an Eighteen Ninety five the state legislature passed a law forbidding the manufacturer say a little bowl or a butter colored only yo or margarine\nOr ... not too long wait are farmers marched to the capital to block a system for bringing yellow only go into the states\nPeople used to have to sneak it across the border from Minnesota an Iowa in Illinois in Michigan uh and uh uh does this resistance or remind you of what's going on now Scott\n[noise] um [noise]\nYou know I I guess I don't really um [noise] you know I look at it from the standpoint of you know if you go on to the store and you buy a gallon of milk I'm from a I'm from a regulatory standpoint or otherwise\nYou pretty much you should be [noise] um I think you know average consumers should be assured that they're getting the same thing day in and day out\nAnd if you allow if you open the door on that to include other things and applies to either butter or um you know the ... the you know the margarine type products you know you're not you're not getting the same thing\nFrom a nutritional standpoint and so can you still\nUse the same name and the same presidents and the dairy case and things like that you know I don't want to be dismissive of the opinion that well look you know milk we can apply to a million things and so forth but but from a regulatory standpoint you know we have to be very thoughtful about what we allowed to use you know these sort of dairy terms\nAnd I appreciate that their industries position you know they have to abide these hundreds of pages of regulations and they work very hard to make sure that that every day I'm you know milk cheese et cetera meet those standards and so if you get there\nYou know if you if you're willing to compete in that market you know the dairy industry has this enormous regulatory burden to um live by abide by and if you get there from some circuitous routes and also call it milk\nI can certainly understand the tension there\nA God Bless them in a minute left about thirty seconds do you think the FDA will alter mentally decide to restrict language round milk\n[noise] you know I think um they're looking at it very closely I think I'm I'm you know how this will come out I'm I'm not quite sure but uh in many cases in the food industry it really\nIt really you know at the end of the day we often take what we do a very global take a position that reflects the incredible movement and I would say Canada and Europe have doing I'm doing my article a suit\nOn the other hand what matters to society most are the changes in the frequency of the intense hurricanes so weak hurricanes that may get up to eighty miles per hour so typically don't cause that many problems that we're more concerned about tendencies in the higher category of hurricane\nDo we ah well what's the evidence that these more intense storms are linked to climate change and why do scientists believed that the two are linked if they are\nWell I think that the primary basis for that belief a rat's upon basic theory which of course is hard to describe to people outside of the field but it's it's fairly robust\nAnd I can describe it a little bit the theory basically says and this was confirmed by observations that given a certain temperature of the ocean and the temperature profile in the atmosphere there is a a speed limit that up or down on how strong and you can make the winds in hurricane and\nWhen we calculate that up or down which varies from place to place and time to time even in the current climate are we seeing that and indeed it's it's almost impossible\nTo find hurricanes that exceed the speed limit although most of them don't make it up close to that speed limit fortunately but the theory is fairly robust as to that speed women and their theory again going back through the years predicts that as you warm the tropical\nOceans that speed limit should go up rather perceptive place so we're comfortable with that theory as far as it goes out the models or have the problem that the global models don't have enough resolution computational resolution really to get intense hurricanes they can model\nWeek storms we're only now just beginning to get to the point of being able to marvel intense hurricanes and the ones that do a do consistently show that the more intense storms become more frequent overtime they're less consistent in their predictions of the numbers have weak storms which in any case Don\nSupport for WPRI comes from Lawrence University in Appleton home to Fifteen hundred undergraduate students from nearly every state and more than fifty countries dedicated to a personalized global education Lawrence dot edu\nBut but on the other hand and has very important implications for the most deadly part of hurricane historically which is the storm surge I mentioned awhile back\nThat's what destroyed the city of Galveston and Nineteen hundred it was a big problem in Hurricane Katrina for example um and it is the large largest killer it is the same phenomena as a nominee\nAnd many listeners will have a seat in the horrible videos of us who nominees that we've had in recent times and places like Japan and the Indian Ocean it's the same thing except that it's caused by wins rather than shaking earth but hydrogen amicably it's the same thing and if you can imagine\nThe nominee arriving in the middle of a hurricane or a typhoon that's what you're up against and I'm as sea level rises um the few nominees are riding on top of an elevated surface they go further inland and they cause more damage it's nothing more much more complicated than that\nKerry Emanuel is a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of technology I carry what is your opinion on calling hurricanes natural disasters [noise]\nWell I've never liked that term and you know quite apart from the whole problem with climate change it's kind of a cop out um nature or has had\nHurricanes and other major logical phenomena for as long\nAs there's been nature nature as well adapted to hurricanes there are places like southern Florida there are eco systems that arguably to some extent depended\nUpon there being a hurricane what's said well just as there are forests that depend upon their being fires once in awhile so nature it's fine with hurricanes it's us but we're the problem\nAnd how we build rebuilding and live in places that are at risk to hurricanes and other natural phenomena\nOf the the phenomena that happens the structures get destroyed and then we call that an act of God or natural phenomena and so it kind of takes attention away from where we really need to direct it\nWhich is you know toward the policies\nThat we have in place which at least in the case the United states actively encourage in some sense subsidized people to live in risky places and while those policies are place we're going to have more and more so called natural disasters whether the climate change affects them or not\nSo what should we called him and said\nWell I think we should call the disasters what they are they're they're uh they're disasters occur uh I I don't have a good name for them off the top by it but the disasters occur\nBecause of unwise policies more than anything else you know if I'm someone building a ordinary condominium near the beach or in a hurricane prone place\nHad to pay and insurance premium that actually\nReflected the risk they wouldn't be able to afford it and I'm so in the U.S oddly enough with all the proponents for free markets we have absolutely nothing like a free market and insurance and we're actively stopping the pricing\nOf insurance premiums should be sending the signal the risk to people who are contemplating building something or buying\nSomething and it hurts\nKnow that's the disaster that that right there is the cause of the disaster if we didn't have that um insurance premiums will be very high so you'd either not\nBuild or by there or if you did build if you could afford to build a fortress that really could take a cat five a dorm in a place like Florida\nWhen our natural disasters not natural that discussion continues in a moment what do you think should we call these natural disasters or if we put our house in the path of a hurricane the week you know can we really call it a natural disaster\nEight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four Kerry Emanuel is a an ... is a professor of

resources\nIn our beyond the ballot feature that we played earlier in the show we heard how worried end up set Wisconsin nights are about the state of the state's roads take us beyond feelings for as the rest of the uh what's the cost of deficient roads and infrastructure for us personally\nWe asked made it in the last report that the total cost state wide of deficient roads was six point eight billion dollars or if you break that down for for example in the Madison area the average driver it's two thousand one hundred and thirty nine dollars\nPer driver but if you look at it a little bit close to the three components are additional vehicle operating costs which is almost half of that costs and and the that is quite simply a the worse shape the roads around the more stress your vehicles operating under\nA and its depreciating that much more quickly ... you can't hold on to that vehicle as long as you would like and that's a huge cost there's also more repairs more fuel consumption but the lifespan of your vehicles probably the most critical one with\nOver a on average five hundred and sixty people being killed annually in vehicle crashes\nIn the state or there's a significant economic costs to that and we estimate in about a third of those crashes if you had ideal roadway safety features in place that are very cost effective you could likely or reduce the likelihood of a serious\nCrash and then the final component about a third of the cost of the costs of traffic congestion on traffic congestion obviously impacts the individual but it also slows down the productivity of businesses and as Wisconsin competes with other regions for for\nBringing businesses into the state having good infrastructure good reliable highways is very critical\nOut what about federal funding or what how does how does that play into this equation well certainly\nA ... at the beginning of the Trump Administration there was significant that discussion of a of a significant boots and infrastructure although really the proposal from the administration were largely to leverage state and local governments from increasing their their investment and transportation\nWe really haven't seen the the the ability for Congress to move on that program and then the current\nFederal program will expire in late two thousand and twenty so we would anticipate that next year as Congress is going to be getting to grapple very seriously with with transportation uh investment but at the same time we just haven't\nSeen the the the uh ability or interest by Congress over the last two decades to significantly boost federal investment so it really is\nSupport for WPRI comes from the history museum at the castle in Appleton gridiron glory the best of the

tariffs on on on on on foreign steel doesn't intact\nDirectly highway construction which typically if it if it involves federal dollars is restricted to using US Steel the reality is is that US Steel prices are impacted when when other sources of of steel go up in terms of pricing\nSo we've got about a minute left or what happens if we do nothing what happens if we just decided to ignore this problem and we don't fix our infrastructure\nIf the state it continues to kick the can down the road what you see are conditions worsening more bridges becoming deficient you see traffic congestion getting worse which impacts businesses you don't see the roadway safety improvements being made that are going to keep you and and your loved one safer and those costs only escalate in in the

we're going to look into this morning on the morning show do you prefer plant based very alternatives to milk like\nAlmond milk or soy milk why do you do you notice the difference in the way you feel tell us about that if you prefer dairy milk over plant based alternatives winds back do you think the FDA's moved to consider whether to control which products can or can't call themselves milk\nIs less about helping consumers and more about helping the dairy industry and why is that eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas at WNPR dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings\nScott ranking is a professor of food science and chair of the department at the University of Wisconsin Madison your morning Scott and welcome to the morning show\nI jog and warning I think for the invitation to speak with your ... your show\nSo how does the food and Drug Administration defined milk\n[noise] well that's a good question um [noise] you know and and the federal regulations you know they they have a definition of mail that speaks to towards the\nIraqi of things including like the health of the animals and and um [noise] uh how it's how it's handled and heat treated it talks about its composition\nAh it also refers to I'm a document called the pasteurized milk ordinance which is\nNearing five hundred pages long of regulations you know dictating really what you know everything about the whole process the state of the farm the state of the milking you know I'm systems or how the milk is handled and truck and processed and labeled et cetera et cetera so there's [noise]\nSo the FDA looks at it with a very very sort of rigorous set of standards I guess you'd say and I'm at so that you know again if you talk about milk and the U.S that you know it's really dictated by hundreds of pages that regulates\nUh I think the same is true also in Canada but Scott what do we know about why consumers turn to plant based alternatives\n[noise] yeah well um and there are certainly you know I'm a collection of reasons why I'm I'm they may do it for 'em you know reasons I'm so for health reasons for instance\nUm some individuals may have a significant allergies to milk proteins and are you know to them you know they shouldn't have a dairy product a milk you know continue milk proteins that type of thing could have significant health implications\nUm others may be may avoid them for the presence of of um of milk sugar lactose in other words he's maybe individuals who have difficulty digesting lactose and and decide to avoid dairy products because\nBecause of that and so so um you know their host of other reasons why they may choose to go for non animal a beverage\nUm um you know they are very legitimate and I think sort of like the the challenges that are um you know if we have all these products that are labeled milk\nSo again I think there are very wise thoughtful reasons why people would avoid the traditional you know animal animal milk ... for instance that you buy at the supermarket [noise] um but I think the controversy resides well who who can use the term milk though and\nAnd if you apply the term milk to the host of different in beverages including al ... and milk and a ... of soy and so forth does that you know\nOf milk then mislead individuals into thinking well they're all just milk so I'm just going to consume anyone and there'll be fine\nWell you know I think the biggest challenges that um you know there there's so many it's such a variety of nutrients um um you know densities in these different products that I think that's where the the the controversy resides\nUm whereas with milk has these very very rigorous standards of how it's made and the standard of identity and its composition\n'em and you know you go to the store any day and you know you well you know you know you will be assured that um that you will have the same so nutrient density day in day out and no matter what milk you buy from what manufacturers\nBut almond and soy and and you know the non animal melts don't have that sort of structure around them so what are you getting you know I think Dennis is er here earlier callers mentioned to you know read the label and and that's very wise but but if you're not reading labels\nYou know and you just said well I'm just I Need some milk well you won't be getting the same thing in terms of nutrient density I think that's where the the trouble resides in applying or one of the problems with applying for allowing the use of milk for all these different alternative you know beverages\nPaul is with those in Washington County Paul welcome to the morning show\nStarted learning [noise] ah I think this guy is a promoter shelter they they they growing or\nThe growing area districts uh hey look no say generic term it's not copyrighted sat trademarked and I I ... into the area where the guy that caused the terrier act out and you'll see a while I guess she will well why don't they call it ... ... ... email or a\nA a normal or up\nTo ... it's a generic term he has to further define that you've got casual almond milk or we slash ... milk which I've seen I've tried it's very good and are you on the outskirts of it the nutrients you know what kind of protein or a mineral content uh\nIt's probably better for the environment that just have a a ... not ... it's not going to a organic that justice system lets polluting the soil and the water ... so I just say the theory industry which has been consolidated together like\nFive thousand hurt farmers where they can't even handle I waste material in a responsible manner so my my plan is uh somebody got to tell them that I get over it you have to further defining milk\nAren't getting their industry needs to just get over it because these other milks are here and they are milk and that's the dairy farmers of course and producers\nAre how big industry groups in their corner pushing to protect their interests or how does how does that play out in front of the FDA who's got the uh who's got the upper hand here\n[noise] yeah no color has a good point in the sense that um you know milk can be applied to a million things and you just need to be a you know allies consumer about what's out there\nAnd I guess I'm I'm you know so in terms of animal milks on whether it's a you know a cow or sheep or goat or I mean they go into the store and you buy that gallon\n... there there are very rigid definitions about um how that product comes to be and but if so so then you go to the store and you buy two percent milk from\nYou know any produce any um processor or any different brand and and because they all have to abide these regulations you know you're getting the same thing if you go to buy\nOr another plant based milk you you're not you don't have that assurance so they don't they don't abide what we would refer to as a standard of identity so so I'm\nI'm so again that's where the rub is right so so you get so you go by animal milk and you're ... you're sure that you're getting a product that meets this hundreds of pages of code that say here's how you here's how you make me feel\nSo it could come along and say well we're going to put you know\nI'm I'm a an an ... or a plant based product into this and and and we'll color red white and and um you know put milk on it too well\nThat's that's where the the ... the difficulty is right and that and that um what are you getting you know and and certainly you know reading a label and all that stuff is good but but I think you know the FDA at looking at that and saying well\nYou know this term milk you know we already have a definition for it and so and that's how you know Canada and and other countries have have looked at it and say well no no no you can't just say well we're up to\nYou know milk has already been defined and I think that's the\nThat's the sort of the basis of the dairy products that are um [noise] I'm Tammy Baldwin is is working on and it essentially says that you know where you just want to force the regulations that already exist that say well here's the definition of milk we already have that\nAnd the ... ... ... ... especially excluding the products that are you know get there through some other route\nWe had a an email from Peter who is from ... and uh the the the slogan his email remember the countered oh your wars here we go again hash tag dairy industry nonsense\nPeter points out that an Eighteen Ninety five the state legislature passed a law forbidding the manufacturer say a little bowl or a butter colored only yo or margarine\nOr ... not too long way to farmers marched to the capital to block a system for bringing yellow only go into the states\nPeople use to have to sneaking across the border from Minnesota an Iowa in Illinois in Michigan uh and uh uh does this resistance or remind you of what's going on now Scott\n[noise] um [noise]\nYou know I I guess I don't really um you know I look at it from the standpoint of you know if you go into the store and you buy a gallon of milk I'm from a from a regulatory standpoint or otherwise you pretty much you should be\n[noise] um I think the average consumer is should be assured that they're getting the same thing day in and day out\nAnd if you allow if you open the door on that to include other things and applies to either butter or um you know the ... the you know the the margarine type products\nYou know you're not you're not getting the same thing from a nutritional standpoint and so can you still use the same name and the same presidents and the dairy case and things like that [noise] you know\nI don't want to be dismissive of the opinion that well look you know milk we can apply to a million things and so forth but but from a regulatory standpoint you know we have to be very thoughtful about what we allowed to use you know these sort of dairy terms\nAnd I appreciate that their industries position you know they have to buy these hundreds of pages of regulations and they work very hard to make sure that that every day I'm you know milk cheese et cetera meet those standards and so if you get there\nYou know if you're if you're willing to compete in that market you know the dairy industry has this enormous regulatory burden to um live by and abide by and if you get there from some circuitous routes and also call it milk I can certainly understand the tension there\nOh God Bless them in a minute left about thirty seconds using the FDA below ultimately decide to restrict language round milk [noise]\nIt very closely I think I'm I'm you know how this will come out I'm I'm not quite sure but in many cases in the food industry it really\nIt really you know at the end of the day we often take what if we do a very global take a physician that reflects every kind of a movement and I would say is Canada and Europe have been doing a lawsuit\nOn the other hand what matters to society most are the\nChanges in the frequency of the intense hurricanes we hurricanes that may get up to eighty miles per hour so typically don't cause that many problems so we're more concerned about tendencies in the higher category of hurricanes\nDo we ah well what's the evidence that these more intense storms are linked to climate change and why do scientists believed that the two are linked if they are\nWell I think that the primary basis for that belief a rest upon basic theory which of course is hard to describe to people outside the field but it's it's fairly robust and I can describe it a little bit the theory basically says and this is confirmed by observations that\nGiven a certain temperature of the ocean and the temperature profile in the atmosphere\nThere isn't a speed limit it up or down on how strong and you can make the wins in a hurricane and when we calculate that up or down which varies from place to place and time to time and you can in the current climate\nNow we see that and indeed it's it's almost impossible to find hurricanes that ... the speed limit although most of them don't make it up close to that speed limit fortunately\nRobots as to that speed with him and then the theory again going back through the years predicts that as he warm tropical oceans that speed limit should go up rather perceptive place so we're comfortable with that theory as far as it goes\nUh the models or have the problem that the global models don't have enough resolution computational resolution we'll eat to get intense hurricanes they can model week storms we're only now just beginning to get to the point of being able to model\nIntense hurricanes and the ones that do a do consistently show that the more intense storms become more frequent overtime they're less consistent in their predictions of the numbers have weak storms which in any case dominate the total number of storms in any place\nWhat's the relationship between a a rising sea level and hurricanes\nWell there's no particular relationship in the sense that rising sea level doesn't affect hurricanes we don't have expect to see any effect at all but but\nOn the other hand and has a very important implications for the most deadly part of hurricane historically which is the storm surge I mentioned awhile back that's what destroyed the city of Galveston and Nineteen hundreds it was a big problem in Hurricane Katrina for example\nUm and it is the large largest killer it is the same phenomena and the sea nominee and many listeners will have a seat in the horrible videos of the sea nominees that we've had in\nRecent times and places like Japan and the Indian Ocean it's the same thing except that it's caused by wins rather than shaking earth but hydrogen amicably it's the same thing and if you can imagine the nominee arriving in the middle of a hurricane or a typhoon that's what you're up against\nAnd I'm as sea level rises\nUm the the nominees are riding on top of an elevated surface they go further inland and they cause more damage it's not more much more complicated than that\nKerry Emanuel is a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of technology I carry what is your opinion on calling hurricanes natural disasters\n[noise] well I've never liked that term and you know quite apart from the whole problem with climate change it's kind of a cop out um nature or has had hurricanes and other major logical phenomena for as long as there's been nature nature is well adapted\nTo hurricanes there are places like southern Florida there are eco systems that arguably to some extent depended upon there being a hurricane what's said well just as there are forests that depend upon their being fires once in awhile so nature is fine with hurricanes\nIt's us but we're the problem and how we build rebuilding and live in places that are at risk to hurricanes and other natural phenomena that the phenomena that happens the structures get destroyed and then we call that an act of God or natural phenomena so\nIt kind of takes attention away from where we really need to direct it\nWhich is you know toward the policies that we have in place which is nice in the case the United states actively encourage in some sense subsidized people to live in risky places and while those policies are place\nWe're going to have more and more so called natural disasters whether the climate change affects them or not\nSo what should we called him and said\nWell I think we should call the disasters what they are they're they're uh they're disasters of their career\nSupport for WPRI comes from American transmission company ATC provides a path to wait for power into communities throughout Wisconsin ATC owns and operates the high voltage electric transmission system that helps keep the lights on businesses running and community strong\nHack could pay and insurance premium that actually reflected the risk they wouldn't be able to afford it\nAnd I'm so in the U.S oddly enough with all the components for free markets we have absolutely nothing like a free market and insurance\nAnd we're actively stopping\nThe pricing of insurance premium shouldn't be spending the signals the risk to people who are contemplating building something or buying something\nIn a hurricane grown or we stopped that signal that disaster that that right there is the cause of the disaster if we didn't have that\nUm insurance premiums will be very high so you'd either not build or by there or if you didn't build if you could afford to build a fortress that really could take a cat caught\nA storm in a place like Florida\nWhen our natural disasters not natural that discussion continues in a moment what do you think should we call these natural disasters or if we put our house in the path of a hurricane the week you know can we really call it a natural disaster\nEight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to
