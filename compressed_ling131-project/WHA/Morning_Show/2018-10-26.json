roasted chicken it's right up there with friday fish fry and it was invented right here in Wisconsin\nSo let me ask you is it a tradition for you to go out for roasted chicken tell us about it and where do you go\nWhere in Wisconsin and you get the best roasted chicken in your opinion do you attempt to roast your own chicken and are you willing to share your recipe eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas the W. P. R. dot org\nOr tweet us at WNPR mornings\nDaniel Higgins is the food and drink reporter for USA Today network Wisconsin his recent piece is titled roasted chicken is Wisconsin invention and supper club staple the recipe is a secret Daniel good morning welcome to the morning show\nFor me I uh I have a\nFeeling that most Wisconsin nights listening will know but just in case tell us what roasted chicken is\nUm it's basically a ... it's like taking a deep fryer and then putting or using um like a a pressure cooker at the same time so you're you're um instead of like it or put something in regular pressure cooker you that a little bit of water you get some steam whatever that would speed up the process of of the cooking\nBut here in essence you're using you know the hot oil instead so what you're doing is it cooks the chicken a lot quicker\nThan it would if you just traditionally the fried it um it quicker cook means less um juice you know it feels everything and and the short it can get something the temperature of the year the meat is that's just the general way it works\nHow would you describe the look and taste a roasted chicken\n[noise] um it's super Jersey it's also to me sometimes you get it and it's I'm so used to have home cooked chicken Noel well I Do it always seems to you know if there's a little too ... it gets dry pretty easy and it's always soldiers see to me I I've always liked that they really\nBecause of juices are clear but it it's really amazing to me um how do you see it is all the way through the other thing is um because they marinate it a little bit at a time and they have a dusting that goes on there\nUm that all the way through you're getting that kind of same flavor that you get from the the crispy skin which is kind of the good bits of of fried chicken anyway but I think um it with the whatever they with their process it's just you get that flavor all the way through um even long after you've um gobble up all that skin\nAnd that and that's kinda what sets it apart from just regular fried chicken isn't it that the flavor does go all the way through\nI think so I ... for the most part I mean uh I'm baby there's someone out there doing fried chicken that has found a way to do it but I I think that's that's the the defining to me I'm part of it is is that you get the flavor all the way through and every bite\nSo the the pressure prior to the combination of pressure and deep prying a is really what makes this ideal because as you said the cooks fast and all the way through and and lots of flavors so let's talk about the history\nOf this technique who was the inventor of L. A. M. Zealand ah what did he set out to\nUm basically he was he was hum of a guy a inventor I'm\nIn the blade area and he's been credited with a lot of other inventions too um they didn't quite get into in the article 'cause they couldn't quite fully tracked on everything but\nUm he wanted some wanted fried chicken but he wanted a quicker than the the normal cooking time so he thought well what if we take a pressure fryer Anna I'm and I'm a pressure cooker I'm Sorry a pressure cooker and deep fry and kind of combined them somehow would that would that work you know I'm up to when he invented\nIt uh you know before that pressure cookers we're kind of had gotten kind of popular but then kind\nOf gotten dangerous where because if you weren't um they didn't have safety features and um before like they do now if you buy pressure cookers now there's little ah valves and and and backup systems so you don't blow up your your pressure cooker but\nThat wasn't the case so they kind of fall a little bit out of favor but he had found a way to combine the two into one one machine\nAnd it was interesting too is with the folks that procedure talked about is that the pot that it goes into um as a slender goal shape is it's kind of raw which creates this I'm as it's under pressure there it's a little bit of a war tax so everything gets done more evenly um with\nWith that kind of shape that they've\nGot no corners that that makes sense I was just so the ... company warned and blow it in Nineteen fifty three how did the invention sprint after that\nUm [noise] it was basically you know it was really a great way for if you're a local restaurant you could have this roasted chicken without having to become KFC or become a a a a full blown chain you know I'm like right on the\nCaller is you have to be called ... and do everything but you can serve roasted chicken and the official roasted chicken and as long as you as long as the the the pressure fryer fits in your kitchen\nThat's fine you can still be um whoever you know my novels supper club or or um hot knobs are riding and author and there but\nUm you know whatever your supper club or a restaurant as you just keep your name but you had roasted chicken as part of your menu options you can still do your friday fish fry and your Saturday Night prime rib and it just kinda fits in with everything else and I think\nThat kind of um versatility really help that spread\nAnd the uh the the ... technique\nThe official roasted chicken which is copyrighted and trademarked and legally protected six ways from Sunday ah that's all part of the uh uh uh what goes along with this as well and we're going to talk some more about that I'm as our conversation continues your Daniel I'm\nI Want to ask our listeners ... is a tradition a is a tradition in your family to go out for roasted chicken where do you like to go for roasted chicken or give us a give us your roasted chicken story maybe tell us about the first time you ever tried it and what that was like\nAnd where do you think the best roasted chicken in Wisconsin might\nBe eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four I have to say I had breakfast this morning but talking about roasted chicken is making me hungry again\nEight hundred six four to one two three four tell us your roasted chicken stories Daniel Higgins is the food and drink reporter for USA Today network Wisconsin and he stays with us as our conversation continues on John months and it's the\nIdeas network of Wisconsin Public radio and this is the morning show [noise]\nHere's a look at the weather forecast as we head into the weekend cloudy skies today a few rain showers possible around the state but more likely in the north hides in the low to mid fifties Saturday continued cloudy some scattered rain or snow showers especially in the northern areas of the state ice in the low fifties\nSunday cloudy with a good chance of rain in the south rain may be mixed with snow in the north highs in the upper forties to near fifty\nThis is Wisconsin Public radio\nComing up after she had an on the morning show will look into why some Americans don't vote and the systemic barriers that keep people from the polls on election day that's after ...

include a log me in makers of go to a meeting a collaborative meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world\nIt's the morning show on the ideas network I'm John Monson in this installment of our series of interviews with Wisconsin candidates for governor we speak with Phil Anderson share the Libertarian Party of Wisconsin\nHe's running against Wisconsin party candidate Arnie ends Democrat Tony neighbors independent Maggie Turnbull Green Party candidate Michael J. white and Republican incumbent\nScott Walker [noise] what is the top issue you want the next governor to focus on after the election and why what questions do you have for Kennedy feel Anderson eight hundred six four to one two three four\nEight hundred six four to one two three four ideas WPRI out or gives the email address or you can tweet us at WNPR mornings\nPhil Anderson is the libertarian candidate for governor of Wisconsin and is currently chaired the Libertarian Party of Wisconsin is also a realtor and lives in Vicksburg Phil thank you for joining us this morning thanks for having me John [noise]\nSo uh the first question is pretty obvious why do you want to be governor of Wisconsin\nWell I I I've seen over the last uh ten twelve years or so that uh\nThe relationship between citizens and their government is rapidly deteriorating not only at the federal level but at the state level and I don't see any change in that with the current Republican Party and the current dark wrap party\nAnd so I I feel like I needed to step up and run and be involved in politics I've decided to do that a few years ago when I ran for state assembly here in Pittsburgh and then US Senate two years ago to represent people's interest at the Capitol and not just the interest of the big parties [noise]\nSo let's look at your top issues one of which is increased local control what exactly do you mean\nWell if I'm elected governor we're going to look at every department of the state government and make some decisions valuations about it and that is a doesn't need to be done can be done in a more local level can be done more efficiently\nAnd I think that we'll see that uh as our economy has changed in as our ability to communicate has changed across the state in across the country\nWill see that there's not really in need as much anymore for\nA serious audit of the Wisconsin DOT from outside source somebody a like a forensic accountant\nBecause of the Wisconsin DOT budget is huge and the roads to start getting getting a built in repaired the way they should be um I think we need to look in terms of funding and more local based solutions more use space solution so I'm I'm not against pulling per se\nBut it needs to be a installed in a way that that makes sense and isn't too big of a dent in the budget but I I I Believe with my whole heart and I think the an audit will show much as I mentioned in the previous segment about 'em over spending on projects that's currently consciously being done by Wisconsin DOT and keep in mind\nThat that process seems to be so routine that the contractors involved and even notify the state that they've been paid twice so I I think that's corruption going on and not just mismanagement\nOf that as it may we need to take a hard look at how the money's being spent right now we don't even know how much it costs to actually build a road\nFrom trying to decipher the Wisconsin DOT budget because there's so much of a mess so we need to take a look at that first and foremost\nWould you be open to raising the gas tax\nI Would prefer not to all things being said um the gas tax wild better then sort of general revenue supportive roads it's it's not strictly use space anymore as there are a lot of electric vehicles on the road I prefer to move to totaling if we need to an end relieve pressure on the gas tax but in in the short term\nOr whatever we can do to move to things that are that are more based on use uh I'm I'm In favor of\nLet's take a phone call here Leslie joins us from Watertown Leslie welcome to the morning show\nGood morning morning thank you for having this fight class as we are ... and ...\nAnd I would like to know what your guest is transparency in open records and government as evidence in the Atlantic article this administrator has not\nWant it and now what they're feeling and so what are your feelings about it is a lady's\nCampaign finance reform we have too much dark money because the United what you need to save a lot of how these fat trends\nLeslie thanks thanks for the call a lot to chew on here let's take the transparency peace first\nWell I I think we need to do a better a better job of being transparent and I'm On record for\nUm you know wanting to install a system right away where where are all the communications in my administration will be completely transparent from the start 'em on record if we need to use ... technology or some other form of technology to make them available to the public it shouldn't take necessarily of a ... ... requests\nFor those to be available they should be a matter of transparency as it is an absolutely right to walk administrator into the terrible job\nAnd even has a um you know some of the testimony we've heard lately from officials saying that they were instructed to to put things on hard copy or to or to say things on the phone or on their private cell phone so that it wouldn't be the subject of a freedom of Information Act request\nIs a is despicable [laughter] ah but we can solve that pretty quickly I made a commitment that all my communications in any all my staffers communications and I'd like to extend the legislature as soon as possible are matter public record immediately when that happened um and aren't aren't subject to some bureaucratic process to be on earth hopefully\nPaying finance reform it given what the Supreme Court has already decided what can we do in Wisconsin\nWell I think we should challenge that I I don't think it was the founders intent and it's certainly not my belief that\nThat corporations are people and that there should be you know for that money equals freedom of speech certainly there's some middle ground there but there's tremendous abuses of that in ways that aren't good for our democracy ah so I support the movement to amend the constitution the federal constitution to to uh to accomplish that\nAnd as governor I Will support any any effort legislative or amending the state constitution to include that and actually challenged the federal the Supreme Court on that issue and fight them on that because\nUh we know the effect of that and it's certainly not the intent of of anybody I don't think except for those interests that have a huge amount of money and actually control our government at this point uh through campaign donations a transparent or non transparent to the Democrat and Republican candidates that's not the intent of any of us who really want to have a government that works for us\nUh Leslie thanks for that call let's take a call next term and in mosquito and good morning thanks for joining us on the morning show what's your question ...\nWell I had a comment and question first I Would say that's a fact I've heard of that I ... and I think it sounded intelligence logical and compassionate\nSide and crashed on secondly I wanted to ask about the idea of local control and how to find local schools and just to let your whole life later college boy I'll take my answer out there\nAre things in a great question of our plan for first wanting the law schools is to leave it relatively the same but try to revert as much of that to the local level as possible uh right now funds travel to the state\nAnd then the state basically a has strings attached when it goes back to the local communities or if it's a Democrat and ... certainly Common Core standards are going to come up whether they're called that or not\nAnd even in the Republican administration of Scott Walker's voucher program which some conservatives look at uh with with happiness is a way to spread federal control of education because in order to spend the money on those vouchers you have to uh\nThose private schools have to adhere to comic or standards which are mad at mandated by the federal government my position on it is that\nThe people in school districts in cities and counties should be deciding what their curriculum is and what's appropriate for their students\nWe still need to fund public schools are program would allow people to opt out of public schools but not with a a not completely it's called the universal open enrollment so those people who want to choose something other than public schools and if they are in areas where the public schools to start doing a very good job\nThey can take that open enrollment money which is anywhere from Eighteen hundred twenty five hundred dollars a year I Choose a different school now the criticism of that has been that that would decimate the funding for public schools but we're still\nAre supporting with most tax dollars public schools and people that are currently paying property tax are uh we don't have kids in school obviously are opting out and paying for education other way so that's the way to still fun public schools as a safety net and as an option for people that use that\nThose people who aren't being served well because of political wrangling about funding about schooling and especially people who are vulnerable uh the poor folks in Milwaukee Madison some other areas have options that they currently don't have so local control for schools balls boils down to people having choices parents\nOr family school districts in terms of how the kids are kids are educated we\nKnow that health care is on the minds of Wisconsin nights and it's this is a pretty broad subject if you like to do what would you change given the current state of health care in Wisconsin\nRight now federal aid at the state level health insurance that health insurance industry runs the health care programs that's why we have health insurance tied up to every single aspect of healthcare so let's drawn example\nIf we were to have the same insurance program for car insurance as we currently have for health insurance that every time you went\nTires it'd be going through this process of dealing with their insurance company and certainly a the the price will go up the choices will go down the quality will go down we need to move towards allowing for separation of those two things I currently belong to a local primary care service called our lady of hope clinic and\nUh I pay a subscription every month that's less than a hundred dollars for me as an adult and it covers all of my exams doctor's visits et cetera et cetera because insurance isn't involved\nSo whenever I can do as governor to help that ... that sort of system you started up so that people have options and then if we need to subsidize that for people so be it but right now\nEvery government subsidy that goes to help pay for people have access to health insurance is really a giveaway to the health insurance industry and has been since ...\nWho knows how long and we need to be able to separate those out so that you know what the real cost of insurance and the real cost of health care and then people can negotiate and and get better a better care and better access who would we be in a ... with\nWell if there's a variety of providers for example ... it just goes to the VA or any any uh any situation where we're subsidizing somebody's healthcare\nUm if they have a choice of where they can go and they and they and their spending money out of something that subsidized as opposed to being all the way routed through insurance I mean we know from from uh the investigations that people have done that often for the same procedure or a medical facility would charge a lot more\nTo insurance company or to to the to the government than they would for a private person paying for that and that doesn't just that doesn't make any sense that should be just\nThis this procedure cause this much and we're building this much but because there's a certain ... to the health insurance aspect of how we get our health care\nThen you sort of things happened and of course that's why health insurance health insurance industry\nOr wrote Obamacare a basically wrote Trump's response to it\nAnd why you'll you won't see any sort of a proposal\nUh do very well at the federal level especially that gets rid of it the insurance companies stranglehold on on the healthcare industry because the health of the health insurance industry spent so much money on politicians and political parties we've got to less than a minute left is Wisconsin ready to elect the libertarian governor well I sure hope so\nI'm part of the problem is that we're not offered a in the debates there's another debate tonight we protested last week outside gentle Fifteen\nAh but I give credit to a public radio for having all the candidates on um we will be having more a candidate forums that include\nWhile we're all six of us will be invited but probably four of us all becoming a ... and so far as the public's aware that that I'm running and and what I stand for um we do very very well and falls but it's just a question of getting uh my name and my ideas out in front of ...\nWhen I first got involved in the last year I actually sixteen or not yeah sixteen years old I'm I was just going in to my sophomore year of high school\nOr my junior year of high school actually and I had been doing a lot of activism at home if you are with different nonprofit organizations such as ... and the alliance\nFor climate education or learning about how climate change impacts young people disproportionately um especially in New York City I'm white especially impacts people of color disproportionately and as I started learning more about climate justice but also being a young person who couldn't necessarily vote ads to um find another way that I could take action\nBut still be hard for them by my politicians\nAnd that's why you became involved in the lawsuit yes\nSo why do you think that having young people as plaintiffs is important in this case\nI think that young people as plaintiffs especially important in this case because as we see the impacts of climate change as\nReports like the IPC report come out we see that\nMy generation is going to have to deal with impacts of climate change that other generations before me had it and we have no real base by which should do that and I feel like because of that we have a basic right to be able to have some control or autonomy over what happens in climate and our future\nIt's been a little over three years now since this case was first filed ended faced challenges right from the start and most recently the Trump Administration requested to stay in the case and the Supreme Court of the United states has put it on hold a ... how did you feel when you found that out [noise]\nYeah I was in essence they're really shocked when I found it out because like you said about this process um the initiation has tried to step in and a lot of\nUh extremely interesting ways for the legal system and basically they've just been a very of this is of getting hired I expect put right in front of them in a court setting which I'm not shocked by because they are ... ... um I think that it's kind of\nDisappointing to see the government or people who are supposed to be caring for their constituents holding the trust of the public running away from cars or is that the public has\nBut that's also why the case exist to hold the government accountable and put them in a system that will do that\nDo you think that this case will eventually make it to court so that the the evidence can be a presented in you know in illegal or legal venue [noise]\nI think it definitely well I think that the judges um that we have are determined to make sure that the case has hurt because they understand that it's precedent setting and at this point it's just up\nThey think that also and matter what their decision is I Know that there is definitely the possibility of appeals and making sure that the story is told one way or another\nSo ultimately what happens if you go all the way through this process and a and lose what will you and the other plaintiffs do\nIf we were to go all the way through the process but Liz I'm Me and the other point is we didn't have any reason to stop doing the work that we're already doing like I\nSaid we have a vested interest in making sure that climate changes but they get it because it's our futures are going to be on the line when it becomes\nThe worst of the issue that it is\nRick Perry is with us on the uh the morning show or one of Twenty one plane to send a case called junior ... versus the United states um she's addressed the un on climate change and is currently a sophomore at U. W. Madison studying political science and environmental studies\nHow ah how have your views changed as an activist since you first got involved in this case three years ago\nI think that the way that is an actor\nChanged is just that I\nHave learned to become better\nAt articulating the message of why use are important to to lose weight because I've seen that question that a lot especially through my where it's on the last ... I've seen a lot of questions from adults of um how young people are able to have this level of autonomy\nAnd if there's any adult influence the actual dollar taking that I think over the last few years we see that young people are autonomy and are really willing to step up and\nAre really willing to take some control over the future that's going to the ...\nWhat kind of reaction have you gotten a two to this a lawsuit from uh just people who are interested or or just others who find out about it what are they saying to you\nYeah I get a lot of questions about the last year about the logistics of it how at work um I get a lot of supportive added a lot of excitement um people like in that there's other routes being taken to change because I think a lot of people are disillusioned right now with um activism and protest in what's going\nOn I think that they get excited about something that they see as tense or change and that's really nice\nUm I had a lot of people who are skeptical questions and not because they're skeptical that just because they're genuinely curious and that that's a lot of fun to get to experience and I'm Talking about so I Love that\nShow do you think litigation is the best option when it comes to fighting climate change\n[noise] you know I don't know exactly what the best option is when it comes to fighting climate change as like but I Do definitely believe that litigation is a really important tortillas especially for young people who necessarily don't have the same political power and the governmental process it's people who could but\nWhat do you say to people who say hey you know what you kids need to just settle down here the adults have this um and uh the silver or the students just silly\nI Would say that there's a lot of examples currently in the world of how the adults do not have us and not have our best interests\nAt heart and aren't taking into consideration that general way that you feel about the world about the direction that the world should be going and I believe that young people are just not going to sit down and stop doing the work that we're doing because\nThe people in power tried to convince us that they're getting a good job because I think that all throughout history that that's been the stance that the people in power or tried to take out people are always like now we're going to keep fighting until the show that were being\nA big buried thank you for spending this time with this this morning I really appreciate it of course\nIan Giuliano versus the United states she's address the un on climate change and is currently an sophomore W Madison studying political science and environmental studies [noise] this program continues interest to them but it's the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nHere's a look at the weather forecast as we head into the weekend cloudy skies today of the rain showers possible around the state but more likely in the north ice in the low to mid fifties Saturday continued cloudy some scattered rain or snow showers especially in the northern areas of the state ice in the low fifties\nSunday cloudy with a good chance of rain in the south rain may be mixed with snow in the north highs in the upper forties to near fifty\nThis is Wisconsin Public radio\nComing up after setting whether you're looking for care or newsman Wisconsin has something for everyone the season I'll talk about corn mazes pumpkin patches costume contacts and more after spending\n[noise] on central time we visit with chef cookbook author sport passionate about\n...

A. M. feeling uh what did he set out to do\nI'm basically he was he was um of of of a guy a inventor I'm\nIn the blade area and he's been credited with a lot of other inventions to 'em that I didn't quite get into in the article 'cause they couldn't quite fully track down everything but um he wanted some you want it fried chicken but he wanted a quicker than the the normal cooking time so he thought well what if we take a pressure fryer Anna\nI'm and I'm a pressure cooker I'm Sorry a pressure cooker and deep fry and kind of combined them somehow would that would that work you know I'm\nUp to when he invented it uh\nYou know before that pressure cookers we're kind of had gotten kind of popular but then kind of gotten dangerous where because if you weren't um they didn't have safety features and um before like they do now if you buy a pressure cooker is now there is little ah valves and and and backup systems so you don't blow up your your pressure cooker but\nThat wasn't the case so they kind of fall a little bit out of favor\nOf favor but he had\nFound a way to combine the two into one one machine and it was interesting too is that what are the folks that procedure talked about is that the pot that it goes into um as of soil in their goal shape is it's kind of raw which creates this I'm as is under pressure there creates a little bit of a war tax so\nEverything gets done more evenly um with with that kind of shape that they've got\nYou're sure no corners that that makes sense so the ... company porn didn't blow it in Nineteen fifty three how did the invention sprint after that\nUm [noise] it was basically you know it was really a great way for if you're a local restaurant you could have this roasted chicken without having to become KFC or become a a\nRight under our as you have to be callers and do everything you can serve roasted chicken official roasted chicken and as long as long as the pressure fryer fits in your kitchen\nThat's fine you can still be um whoever you know separate 'em ups are right there in there but um you know whatever your supper club or a restaurant is just keep your name but she roasted chicken\nAs part of your menu options you can still do your friday fish fry and your Saturday I prime rib and it just kinda fits in with everything else I think\nThat kind of um for security really help it spread\nAnd the uh the roasting technique and and the recipe that's involved with the official roasted chicken which is copyrighted and trademarked and legally protected six ways from Sunday\nAh that's all part of the uh uh uh what goes along with this as well and we're going to talk some more about that I'm as our conversation continues your Daniel I'm\nI Want to ask our listeners ... is a tradition a is a tradition in your family to go out\nFor roasted chicken where do you like to go for roasted chicken or give us a give us your roasted chicken story maybe tell us about the first time you ever tried it and what that was like\nAnd where do you think the best roasted chicken in Wisconsin might be eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four I have to say I had breakfast this morning but talking about roasted chicken is making me hungry again\nEight hundred six four to one two three four and tell us your roasted chicken stories Daniel Higgins is the food and drink reporter for USA Today network Wisconsin and he stays with us as our conversation continues on John months and it's the\nIdeas network of Wisconsin Public radio and this is the morning show [noise]\n\nHere's a look at the weather forecast as we head into the weekend cloudy skies today a few rain showers possible around the state but more likely in the north ice in the low to mid fifties Saturday continued cloudy some scattered rain or snow showers especially in the northern areas of the state ice in the low fifties\nSunday cloudy with a good chance of rain in the south rain may be mixed with snow in the north highs in the upper forties to near fifty\nThis is Wisconsin Public radio\nComing up next on point go behind the headlines from the economy and health care to politics and the environment and so much more he's got you covered we on point next on the ideas network\n[noise]\nMany Wisconsin Public radio members have contributed for Thirty years or more and they want the programming\nThat they love to be here for the next generation hello I'm John ghetto WPRI southwest regional manager you can help sustain the future of Wisconsin Public radio by naming WPRI as a beneficiary of your retirement plans for more information called\nEight eight eight nine zero nine four one six three or visit WPRI legacy dot org [noise]\nSupport for WPRI comes from the riverside theater in Milwaukee presenting violinist it sock Perlman performing live in concert Thursday November rate tickets in more information for its ...
