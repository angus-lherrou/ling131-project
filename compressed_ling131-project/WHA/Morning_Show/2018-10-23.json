the hardest time understanding are you concerned about these moves to put biological definitions on gender or does it make sense do you what factors into your perspective eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six or two one two three four\nYou can email us at ideas WPRI dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings Brian Powell is a professor of sociology at Indiana University his research is focused on family education gender and sexuality Brian good morning welcome to the morning show\nThe morning John thank you for inviting me\nFor those who may not know defined for is what it means to be transgender\nTransgender um involves two parts and involved first of all the sex that you were assigned at birth\nAnd it's really weird racing to thank you were assigned to sex at birth baby does not determine you know their their sex at birth parents or doctor does and they do it based in terms of sex\nUm they do it based on um ... or or or or or some type of physical indication of it they could look for\nChromosomes you know but but the chromosome test so that they're using they're using sexual genitalia typically in terms of their definition of sex on the other hand\n... everybody from those people the idea of being told than what you find yourself at what you see yourself as what you deep down believe you are is not you know just to deny that\nIt's going to have a powerful effect on people's social so south\nThere you know could this have\nImplications in terms of their mental health yes\nCould it has implications on their their likelihood um for their likelihood to some type of behavior that would be harmful to them absolutely could result in them becoming closet and denying who they are\nAnd in an intern than having impacts on other people as well absolutely\nDo you see differences between what transgender people face and how we treat gay lesbian bisexual people\nI think there's a I think there are many parallels between the two um and I I think if we look at the attitudes that Americans had regarding same sex couples and regarding gay people like Fifteen Twenty years ago we would have found that about forty\nPercent of the population a would be supportive and sixty percent but not as completely flipped in a really short period of time so it's over sixty percent of the people now or supportive of same sex couples with same sex marriage it's closer actually to Seventy\nAnd it's been a flip right now the research that might reach my team has been collecting indicates that views regarding transgender people is precisely where Americans we're about Fifteen Twenty years ago on same sex couples\nSo there are parallels then between the transgender rights movement and the gay rights movement\nI absolutely I think the difference there a couple of different says I think one of the differences is there had been\nRegarding gay issues it had been something that people have been discussing for a long period of time\nAnd it had intensified intensified the Nineteen nineties spent two thousand\nWhen it comes to transgender issues it's a more recent phenomenon in terms of public discussion I mean they're being transgender people for a long long long period of time but it's only when the past few years that there's been a surge and discussion on it\nAnd I think so one of the difference is is when it comes to thinking about same sex couples when it comes to think about gay people it was a period of time for it\nEvolve when it comes to transgender people is coming in ... public views it's it's it's coming very quickly\nAnd I think that's one of the reasons why there has been you know ... and I think that's one of the reasons why public views haven't changed that much could still ... such a short period of time\nTo do it is this a case where policy move faster than public acceptance\nUm I think another difference between gay issues regarding I'm gay gay people and and and same sex couples in that case public opinion seemed to basically proceed legislation and court decisions\nIt's hard for me to imagine the Supreme Court would have reached the decision regarding same sex marriage had public opinion not been in favor of same sex marriage at that point\nFor trans gender people right now some of the changes that occurred during the Obama administration or changes that will really powerful changes and improve the lives of many transgender individuals and their families\nBut some of those changes did her her before public opinion\nHas and could have public opinion has reached the point that the majority of people really um like accept the notion of what transgender means\nLet's take a call damage is with this this morning in drumming Dan welcome to the morning show\nUh yeah my question is how much would you say the religious factor uh get into this I mean you got people who call themselves ... Inc\nAnd say well the Bible says there's and God's says this and I just wonder how much of tech bad habits\nI go ahead I I think religion is a key factor or certain types of religion is as a factor I think people who take sort of little is physicians regarding religion and in particular have\nBeen the most resistant to changes in ... most resistant to the changes in terms of providing writes transgender people this is also the group of people that was most opposed to same sex marriage\nAnd this also if we go back fifty years ago was the group that was most opposed to interracial marriage so yes religion plays a role ironically right now the people the people who find themselves who are very religious or to find themselves of for religious\nWho are opposed to transgender rights are also invoking science at the same time\nAnd that's a really interesting change because often you see this it's religion versus science in this case many religious people are trying to invoke religion also as their reason why they are opposed to transgender rights\nI Want to circle back to something we touched on a little bit earlier and that is the differences between sects and gender in your research have you found that most people generally understand that there's a difference between sects and gender\nI think most people do not understand it and quite bluntly if you read most articles including the New York times article\nThey confound these you know they can found that to you know sex and gender are pretty much used interchangeable you by most people\nAnd we did we conducted surveys with approximately four thousand people in the past year on the issue regarding transgender some of the definitions of views regarding transgender individuals and I can just tell you people to not distinguish between the two in their minds\nDoes this confusion around sexual and gender play into people's understanding of what it means to be a transgender person\nI think most people I ... I think there are several different categories of people there's one category of people who they they they appear to at least understand how what transgender individuals to\nFind themselves to be and they privilege identity what does the person I doubt\nFire house and that group and this group probably is around forty percent of the population at this point police that transgender people should be defined as whatever they define themselves to be and should have\nCorresponding writes the remaining group to not see that it's instead\nThey believe that deep down\nYou are what you were born as and more than anything else just as the Trump Administration guidelines soon to be emphasizing sexual genitalia is sexual genitalia that is defining what they think of as men and women\nSo what would it take for more people to understand that accept transgender people\nWell one thing we can learn something from the change of the public views regarding a same sex couples and homosexuality and that is exposure to the topic and exposure to people who fall into those categories\nWe can think of the number of people the number of found the number of family members who tell their other family members that they were gay or told their friends who told their coworkers that\nHas a very very powerful effect on people's fears\nHaving television shows or media in which public figures are actors actresses politicians talk about their own experiences with a transgender relative or being transgender can have a very very powerful effect\nI think the more personalized we can think about people the more likely we are going to respect them and give them taking the day\nSo is this going to take a I don't know for lack of a better metaphor an Alan moment on national television to to start to changing the way people see transgender people\nBut I well let's put it this way there wasn't Justin Ellen moment it was an Ellen moment it was on rose and it you know it was on will and grace it was on many shows but I think we're going to have to have multiple of these moments\nYou know I was over simplifying for time as a as a habit I but I think you know this has been a fascinating question and we will continue to follow this this issue Brian Powell thanks for joining us this morning they could show\nRyan Powell is a professor of sociology at Indiana University his research is focused on family education gender and sexuality\nYou're listening to the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nKind of anecdotal stories of young people who had experienced this but we really know how widespread it was and so we\nSurveyed them and asked about their experiences and\nAnd found that about five percent had been the victim of extortion and about three percent of the students we surveyed admitted to threatening others with\nExplicit images that were shared so I I think it's it's a it's a good kind of baseline of the extent to which this this is happening among youth\nWe're talking about sex door ... with Justin ... professor of criminal justice at the W o Claire and co director of the cyber bullying Research Center parents what's your reaction here are you surprised to learn that this is happening what questions do you have for or against about ...\nWhat do you think can be done to try to prevent this from happening or is it inevitable uh as long as teams in technology ... co exist eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four speaking of technology Justin\nTo what extent is this issue been fueled by the ubiquitous nature of smartphones\nWell smartphones and their capabilities certainly make this easier right because you've got a camera in the palm of your hands you've got the ability to to share anything with anybody pretty much anywhere uh in when you have\nSome people particularly adolescence being more prone to impulsivity and doing things that might seem like a good idea and the moment ah they can act on impulses in that moment and for example share and explicit image with somebody not considering\nThe potential long term ramifications so while\nThis could have happened to thirty forty years ago and somebody could have taken a picture could share that picture with somebody else and threats could be made of course it would be days if not weeks\nBetween the time of taking a picture and sharing it and there was only maybe one picture copies could be made so it could have happened years ago but it ... it's a lot easier\nSo who is most likely to be a victim of six door she\nWell we'll only looked at a few different characteristics we surprisingly found about boys were more likely to be the victim of sexual Russian than girls\nMost of the kind of public incidents that we're aware of involve girls who were targeted um and there's one other studied that sort of college students about sex door shut and kind of found the ... the same thing um\nBut we also found that those youths who identify as non heterosexual are more likely to be the victim of extortion or perhaps they put themselves in a position to be more vulnerable because of their identity and their status and maybe they're not\nOut with friends for example and so it's easier to threaten them\nBut we really didn't find any for example race difference really not even any significant difference by age we expected it to go up as kids got older and generally it did but not not a kind of nice neat linear trend\nUh like we expected so there than certainly there's a lot more that we need to investigate to figure out a who's experiencing this and why\nYou also found in your research that many teens are both victims and offenders are of sex doors and what explains that\n[noise] that's right and so primarily in those who admitted to us that they had threatened to others are so had participated in ... or disproportionately likely to have been the victim themselves and so\nIt could be a lot of things now our study or wasn't longitudinal meaning we didn't collect the data over time so we don't necessarily know which came first but we speculate that the victimization came before the offending so\nUh if you threatened me then I'll threatened you or if if I'm the victim of extortion then I I see this as maybe\nYou know a normative behavior or at least tolerable behavior and so all all threatened the others are but we're not off at all surprised by that because in in most of the kind of on line and I'll find frankly for that matter behaviors that we explore among youth\nOr there is a very close connection between the victim of a victimization and offending\nSo we see that with bullying and cyber bullying and and other behaviors as well\nWhat was the what was the thing that was the most surprising about your research results what was that was the weather any real aha moments here\nWhile apart from the the fact\nThat boys seemed to be involved in more than than girls on the victimization front\nUh I wouldn't say it was really shocking but it it it's telling that uh the vast majority of the time when these things happened uh the the person who's making the threats\nIs someone known to the target so\nMost often it's a boyfriend or girlfriend which which makes sense right so are you sharing image with a significant other or in confidence hope you can trust them and it turns out in some cases you can't and they make a certain threat a to share those images are also happens\nOr the the person making the threats in some other online friend or other friend in real life so\nThe somewhat surprising thing was it's very rare for the person making the threats to be a complete stranger [noise] ah\nSo it's so it's not like somebody for example hacked into a computer and stole images and then made threats or are somehow took over the the webcam on on a targets computer and and got the images surreptitiously so in the vast\nMajority of cases are the images were\nThe person knew trusted within a relationship with a and eventually that the you know that relationship turned and the threats were made\nWere talking about ... with Justin ... professor of criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and co director of the cyber bullying Research Center parents what's your reaction here surprised\nTo learn that this was happening what do you think can be done to try to prevent this from happening or is this type of misbehavior inevitable as long as teens and technology\nAre both involved give us your take it eight hundred six four to

tell us about the rural health initiative and the concept of kitchen wellness [noise]\nYeah they can they do have a kitchen a wellness really came from the farm women um when we thought of this idea of this started back in two thousand three when\nA group of people from chat community health action team\nA group of people spearheaded by say they care um northeast Wisconsin health system that said you know we they noticed that the only time we really saw farmers were when they were coming into the emergency room and the emergency doctors thought boy if we could have just saw some of these people earlier\nWith all that big heart attack that big strokes that big diabetic episode if we could just caught them sooner and I'm going to prevent we could have prevented this so there was a group of people that look at how they can um\nHeld side of the walls of the clinics and hospitals how they can improve the health of the of their community and there was a group of people that went on a plunge which is just an adult field trip from this group and they went out and saw a day in a life of a farmer\nAnd they saw you know what they deal with it I'm dealing with the long hours and the hard work ethic that they have but dealing with the stress of whether the stress of the uh\nThe price of health care the distance I'm just on and on there's so many issues so many barriers that prevent farmers from coming in\nAnd so they came back and there were a group of foreign women that we gather together and we said how can we help get your farmers your your husband's in and threw out a lot of discussion finally one of the far women said you know we really appreciate your kindness\nBut they said here just not going to get her husband's in\nUnless you unless you come to the farm you're just not going to see him and that was a retired cardiologist and the room Dr John Milky\nAnd he said why can't we why can't we bring health care to the farm\nWhy do we think that they should change their way of living\nTo come in for services because if you think about it everything else comes to the farm the veterinarian comes to the farm the field the feed 'em their supplies get delivered to the farm we get we wait for them to come to health care and\nSo that was where the idea was born I was sort of an off the cuff comment from afar woman they just said you know you're just not going to get them in and they're not going to take the time away so they look so then when we had this idea we said well what are we going to do about it so we formed the a real health initiative and ... and we said\nLet's just give it a try let's\nPilot for three years and see if we can make any type\nOf impact and so that was when I was hired and January two thousand four\nAnd I I have a farming backgrounds so that really helped because\nThey weren't even really sure how I was going to get to the farm\nOr explain what we would like to do and um I thought well who came to our farm I when I was growing up so I started writing along with the wrote drivers and the veterinarians and the milk van and I would just right along and jump out of their truck and say you know\nDo you need your blood pressure taken [laughter] and uh you know I can come back tomorrow a few fast they can come back and\nWe can check your cholesterol and your your blood sugars\nOr we can do this right here on the farm and that's where our kitchen and wellness\nIdea was born was um it's amazing how important the kitchen table is\nBecause we think about it it's a place where we talk about the important things in life we talk about our family we talk about our health we talk about our finances usually when when we want to have a big discussion and we sit down at the kitchen table\nAnd so we said this is kitchen wellness we're bringing it right to the the kitchen table\nAnd let's let's talk about the health issues that you may or may not be having but let's make sure you know your numbers so that's where it started in two thousand four\nYou mentioned uh checking blood pressure uh doing some blood testing for a cholesterol levels what other services are offered during these home visits\nYeah so what we do is we are they know they were coming so we have a great turnout rate right we don't have any no shows um so when we come to their table we sit down with them and have them fill out an assessment which is a missing them at the health risk assessment asking them questions about their health and their behaviors\nAnd then we do a simple blood dry and it tells us they're total lip and panel which is their total cholesterol they're good and they're bad cholesterol triglycerides and their glucose\nWe do their heightened their weight on which then also gives us their body mass index which we\nSaid BMI and we also do their body fat analysis [noise] um we take their blood pressure and this can all be done we get the results we get instant results of their blood test within ten minutes\nBut that's really where the magic happens when you can explain to someone this is what your number should be and this is what your number is\nJust very you know it's not accusing it's just it is what it is\nHealth education we can set goals within individual we can see if they can um start making some lifestyle changes because that's the ultimate goal is if we can prevent them from having I'm becoming a diabetic for instance you know that that's a great place to catch them\nBefore they get it or in the early stages that they can reverse it um we also can do at a ones the which is a a more diagnostic test for\nDiabetes but once it gets above that level once we detect that they may have a serious condition I'm really they do need to see a health care provider and typically then they'll go if they know that there's something wrong\nThey will go for care and they're also very compliant with their providers\nSo that's really great they know that they don't have time to be sick\nThe problem is is they don't think about it I'm thinking I think that anything's wrong because as long as they can get up every day and work and just go about their business they think they're just fine but in actuality when we sit down at the table and we do to do their testing\nFifty two percent of the time we find something acute something that they didn't know they had um that could potentially turn out to be something serious\nSo how does this service get paid for do you do the people who are receiving their service pay anything where does the funding come from\nYeah so the funding is a tricky part\nFrom the very beginning we didn't want it costs to be a barrier to the farmers farmers are self employed self insured\nThey don't share their insurance costs with others they're not involved in group plans um they also live and work in the same environment which is considered the number one most risk is occupation\nAnd so they're um rates are often very high so what they'll do their premiums are very I'm very very expensive and that is often with a high deductible that at least five thousand some time with him some sometimes at ten thousand dollar\nThat Dr ... so that's one of their barriers of why they don't come in they're already paying high cost but then there are also\nUm I have this barrier of the high deductible so really why would they go in if they don't think anything's wrong right so um and and if they do come in and for preventive health screening they're going to have to pay out of pocket\nSo for us we didn't want to have to charge and I'm very off to the farmers don't qualify for programs\nIt really would um that that's\nThat's it and I guess that's the tricky part of the program is how to keep it funded I'm a misconception many might have is that they think that there's\nGovernment or federal funding or state or Coney funding there is actually zero dollars that come from the government and in any way I'm including our local you know Coney\nUm this is all a hundred percent community supported you know a great option would be for the health care systems to say in in in any community say to say we're willing to take this on because it is that important\nUm so it could be it one health care system that says we want to do this for our whole service area\nThat it's worth the the amount so wherever the funding\nComes from it could happen in many different places or different ideas for us particularly and channel or the game you know a pack\nA counties um they didn't care has been a great supporter but it hasn't been a hundred percent um the other they've actually been thirty two percent so we still need to raise the others you know sixty for fifty percent\nOf the funding from our community through fundraisers and threw\n'em donations and sponsorships through other organizations such as the agribusiness is\nUh what's your relationship and like with the uh the main health care providers into three counties that you serve\nAs far as health care providers um the the doctors as far as those providers they have been fantastic they're very much on board we work in collaboration with each other where we um we refer clients in because we're detecting things\nAnd then so every once in a while they'll have a farm person that comes in for something else and they say we should do this type of testing and it and they'll say\nTo the the farmer well why don't we have the real health initiative come out to help save some money so that um that you don't have to have it in the office\nSo I'm so we work in tandem as far as insurance um you know often people said well why couldn't the insurance companies help with this couldn't couldn't they contribute um it would be great if they would contribute um as\nA financial aid to the program because we are on the front and working on prevention this is all about prevention\nAnd it would be ... um\nBetter to help on the front and um to prevent something happening for rather than at the end when it's a pretty catastrophic uh once that big episode of a heart attack stroke or you know diabetes happens um as far as insurance every farmer has a different insurance company\nAnd um it to find that one provider to say you know oh well we'll do will support this program is it's been almost impossible for us so we\nWe know that announcer prevention is worth a pound of cures so that that's certainly willing to be the case here so I guess that leads to the question and we're we're running out of time here but what kind of outreach just the rural health initiative do to encourage healthy behavior in rural Wisconsin\nThe first thing is knowing your numbers so we want our our clients and no are farmers to know what their blood pressure what their cholesterol and what their blood sugar levels are then we want them to be educated on the simple things that they can do reducing sugary beverages eating more fruits and vegetables\nUm eating less weighing less feeling better um each year we we focus in on one educational piece\nAnd we're trying to help our farmers live healthier lifestyles both and their health and wellbeing and also in safety\nAnd where can our listeners go if they're interested either if they're in your service area they're interested in getting care through the rural health initiative or if or if they want to help out working they go for more information about you are in this nation\nThey can go to our website which is W.

sexuality Brian good morning welcome to the morning show\nMorning John thank you for inviting me\nFor those who may not know defined for is what it means to be transgender\n[noise] transgender um involves two parts and involved first of all the sex that your assigned at birth\nAnd it's really weird facing the thank you were assigned to sex at birth\nAb does not determine their their sex at birth parents or doctor does\nAnd they do it based in terms of sex um they do it based on um genitalia or or or or some type of physical\nIndication of it they could look for chromosomes you know but but the chromosome test so that they're using they're using sexual genitalia typically in terms of their definition of sex\nThe idea of being told than what you find yourself or what you see yourself as what you deep down believe you are is not the you know and just to deny that it's going to have a powerful effect on people's social so south\nThere you know could this have implications in terms of their mental health yes could it has implications on their their likelihood um for their likelihood to some type of behavior that would be harmful to them absolutely\nCould result in them becoming closet ... who they are and in an intern than having impacts on other people as well absolutely\nDo you see differences between what transgender people face and how we treat gay lesbian bisexual people\nI think there's um I think there are many parallels between the two um and I I think if we look at the attitudes that Americans had regarding same sex couples and regarding gay people like Fifteen Twenty years ago\nWe would have found that about forty percent of the population a would be supportive and sixty percent but not\nAs completely flipped in a really short period of time so it's over sixty percent of the people now or supportive of same sex couples the same sex marriage it's closer actually to Seventy and it's been a flip\nRight now the research that light risque light team has been collecting indicates that views regarding transgender people is precisely where Americans we're about Fifteen Twenty years ago on same sex couples\nThe transgender rights movement and the gay rights movement\nI absolutely I think the difference there a couple of differences I think one of the differences is there had been\nRegarding gay issues it had been something that people had been discussing for a long period of time and it had intensified intensified the Nineteen nineties when two thousand\nWhen it comes to transgender issues it's a more recent phenomenon in terms of public discussion I mean they're being transgender people for a long long long period of time but it's only when the past few years that there's been a surge in discussion on it\nAnd I think so one of the difference is is when it comes to thinking about same sex couples when it comes to think about gay people\nIt was a period of time for people to as Obama said evolve\nWhen it comes to transgender people is coming in the public views it's it's it's coming very quickly and I think that's one of the reasons why there has been you know the ... and I think that's one of the reasons why public views haven't changed that much because it's still ... such a short period of time\nTo do it is this a case where policy move faster than public acceptance\nUm I think another difference between gay issues regarding I'm gay gay people and and and same sex couples in that case public opinion seemed to\nBasically proceed legislation and court decisions it's hard for me to imagine the Supreme Court would have reached the decision regarding same sex marriage at public opinion not been in favor of same sex marriage at that point\nFor trans gender people right now some of the changes that occurred during the Obama administration or changes that will really powerful changes and improve the lives of many transgender individuals and their families\nBut some of those changes deter her\nBefore public opinion has and could have public opinion has reached the point that the majority of people really um like accept the notion of what transgender meets\nLet's take a call damage is with this this morning in drumming Dan welcome to the morning show\nUh yeah my question is how much would you say the religious factor\nUh get into this I mean you got people who call themselves ... Inc say well the Bible says and God's to this and I just wonder how much of that bad\nI go ahead I I think religion is a key factor or certain types of religion is as a factor I think people who take sort of littlest positions regarding religion and in particular\nHave been the most resistant to changes in ... most resistant to the changes in terms of providing writes transgender people this is also the group of people that was most opposed to same sex marriage\nAnd this also if we go back fifty years ago was the group that was most opposed to interracial marriage so yes religion plays a role\nIronically right now\nThe people the people who to find themselves who are very religious or to find themselves with for religious who are opposed to transgender rights are also invoking science at the same time\nAnd that's a really interesting change because often you see this gets religion versus science in this case many religious people are trying to invoke religion\nAre opposed to transgender rights\nI Want to circle back to something we touched on a little bit earlier and that is are the differences between sects and gender in your research have you found that most people generally understand that there's a difference between sects engendered\nI think most people do not understand it and quite bluntly if you read most articles including the New York times article they can found these you know they can found that to\nYou know sex and gender are pretty much used interchange ugly by most people\nAnd we did we conducted surveys with approximately four thousand people in the past year on the issue regarding transgender some of the definitions and views regarding transgender individuals and I can just tell you people to not distinguish between the two in their minds\nSo how how does this confusion around sexual and gender play into people's understanding of what it means to be a transgender person\nI think most people I ... I think there are several different categories of people\nThere's one category of people who they they they appear to at least understand how what transgender individuals to find themselves to be and they privilege identity what does the person identify us\nAnd that group and this group probably is around forty percent of the population at this point\nBelieves that transgender people should be defined as whatever they define themselves to be and should have corresponding writes the remaining group to not see that it's\nInstead they believe that deep down you are what you were born as\nAnd more than anything else just as the Trump Administration guidelines soon to be emphasizing sexual genitalia is sexual genitalia that is defining what they think of as men and women\nSo what would it take for more people to understand at except to transgender people\nWell one thing we can learn something from the change of the public views regarding a same sex couples and and I'm a sexuality\nAnd that is exposure to the topic and exposure to people who fall into those categories\nWe can think of the number of people the number ... found the number of family members who tell their other\nFamily members that they were gay or told their friends who told their coworkers that has a very very powerful effect on people's fears\nHaving television shows or media in which public figures are actors actresses politicians talk about their own experiences with a transgender relative or being transgender can have a very very powerful effect\nI think the more personalized we can think about people the more likely we are going to respect them and give them dignity\nSo is this going to take a I don't know for lack of a better metaphor and Allen moment on national television to to start to changing the way people see transgender people\nBut I well let's put it this way there wasn't Justin Ellen moment it was an Ellen moment it was on Roseanne it you know it was on will and grace it was on many shows but I think we're going to have to have multiple of these moments\nYou know I was over simplifying for time as a as a habit of it but I think you know this has been a fascinating discussion and we will continue to follow this this issue Brian ... thanks for joining us this morning John\nRyan Powell is a professor of sociology at Indiana University\nShouldn't gender and sexuality you're listening to the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nWe surveyed them and asked about their experiences and and found that about five percent had been the victim of extortion and about three percent of the students we surveyed admitted to\nThreatening others with explicit images that were shared so I think it's it's a it's a good kind of baseline of the extent to which this this is happening among youth\nWe're talking about sex doors you adjusted impassioned professor of criminal justice at the you W O Claire and co director of the cyber bullying Research Center parents what's your reaction here are you surprised to learn that this is happening what questions do you have for gas to about ...\nWhat do you think can be done to try to prevent this from happening or is it inevitable uh as long as teams in technology ... co exist eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four speaking of technology Justin\nTo what extent is this issue been fueled by the ubiquitous nature of smartphones\nWell smartphones and their capabilities certainly make this easier right because\nGot the ability to to share anything with anybody pretty much anywhere uh in when you have\nSome people particularly adolescence being more prone to impulsivity and doing things that might seem like a good idea and the moment ah they can act on impulses in that moment and\nFor example share and explicit image with somebody not considering the potential long term ramifications so while this could have happened to thirty forty years ago somebody could have taken a picture could share that picture with somebody else and threats could be made of course it would be days if not weeks\nBetween the time of taking a picture in sharing it and there was only maybe one picture I mean copies could be made so it could have happened years ago but it is a lot easier now\nSo who is most likely to be a victim of six doors\nWell we only looked at a few different characteristics we surprisingly found that boys were more likely to be the victim of sexual Russian than girls most of the kind of public incidents that we're aware of\nInvolve girls who were targeted um and there's one other study that sort of college students about sex door shut and kind of ... the same thing um\nBut we also found that does youth who\nIdentify as non heterosexual are more likely to be the victim of extortion or perhaps they put themselves in a position to be more vulnerable because of their identity and their status and maybe they're not out with friends for example and so it's easier to threaten them\nBut we really didn't find any\nFor example race difference really not even any significant difference by age we expected it to go up\nAs kids got older and generally it did but not not a kind of nice neat linear trend uh like we expected so there then certainly there's a lot more that we need to investigate to figure out um who's experiencing this and I don't know why\nYou also found in your research that many teens are both victims and offenders are of sex doors and what explains that\n[noise] that's right and so primarily those who admitted to us that they had threatened to others are so had participated in sex or ... or disproportionately likely to have been the victim themselves and so it could be a lot of things now our study\nAh wasn't longitudinal meaning we didn't collect these data over time so we don't necessarily know\nWhich came first but we speculate that the victimization came before the offending so uh if you threatened me then I'll threaten you or if if I'm the victim of sexual coercion that I see this as maybe\nYou know no normative behavior or at least tolerable behavior and so all all threatened to others uh but we're not off at all surprised by that because in in most of the\nKind of online and off line frankly for that matter of behaviors that we explore among youth a there is a very close connection between the victim of a victimization and offending so we see that with bullying and cyber bullying and and other behaviors as well\nWhat was the what was the thing that was the most surprising about your research results what was it was the weather any real aha moments here\nWell apart from the the fact that boys seem to be involved in more than than girls on the victimization front or I wouldn't say it was really shocking but it it it's\nTelling that uh the vast majority of the time when these things happened uh the the person who's making the threats is someone known to the target so\nWhich which makes sense right so uh you share an image with a significant other or in confidence hope you can trust them and it turns out in some cases you can't and they make a certain threat or to share those images are it also happens\nOr the the person making the threats of some other online friend or other friend in real life so the somewhat surprising thing was is very rare\nFor the person making the threats to be a complete stranger a folk so it's not like somebody for example hacked into a computer and stole images and then made threats or are somehow took over the the webcam on other\nTargets computer and I got the images surreptitiously so in the vast majority of cases ah the images were originally shared with someone the person knew trusted within a relationship with a and eventually that the you know that relationship turned and the threats were made\nWere talking about sex door ... with Justin ... professor of criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and co director of the cyber bullying Research Center parents what's your reaction here surprised to learn that\nThis was happening what do you think can be done to try and prevent this from happening or is this type of misbehavior inevitable as long as teams and technology\nAre both involved give us your take it eight hundred six four to one two three four eight
