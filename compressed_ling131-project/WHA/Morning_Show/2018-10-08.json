[noise] judge Brett Kavanaugh became justice Brett Kavanaugh Saturday as he was sworn in as the one word fourteen justice to the United States Supreme court selections ... conservative control of the high court possibly for decades\nWhat's your reaction to the Senate vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four\nIdeas that WPRI dot org or you can tweet us at WPRI mornings\nCharlie Jacobs joins us to talk about this today he's an associate professor of political science at Saint Norbert college into pier is areas of expertise include American politics and the judicial process Charlie thanks for joining us this morning on the morning show\nMy pleasure John\nSo it's been one heck of a political weekend what's different now from forty eight hours ago\nWhat's different now is that\nJustice Kavanaugh will arrive at his chambers he'll start working on the business of the court which really kicked off about a week ago when the session began although of course the court and uh it's that's been working for a long time in the near term we're not going to see any significant change in what is occurring on the court they'll do their business as usual\nWe have to wait for is the announcement of some opinions and some opinions that will give us some sort of signal about how he is behaving whether or not he is a voting at a consistent fashion either in a liberal direction or to conservative direction\nAnd with whom he is voting so the blocks of justice is that he is working with to come up with a particular decision\nSo ... there's going to be a leg here we're not really going to do much and really the blockbuster cases in any term in the United States Supreme court they don't come until June anyway because they typically fit on them while they work on the language and the interpretation of the law so\nFor most of us who study the court we wait until the until we get some data to work with the exactly what's going on\nAs a practical matter I mean what's the real timeline for justice cabinet yes he's sworn in yes he's a member of the court yes you'll be in in his office ah what's the ... there'll be some ramping up ah what's the process for getting him situated there\nWas inaugurated I mean I think these people were already to vote they were ready to vote a year ago or more and and to try to undo it in any way what they think is is has happening to the nation so\nI don't think it's going to really change those individuals much except get them more excited may drive them to do a little bit more work to get more people to the polls they typically what we see in mid term elections is lower turnout for Democrats who tend to come out and greater numbers in in the presidential election years [noise]\nSo the hope is is that they can really\nDrive a get out the vote campaign to get people there this may spur some Democrats but I don't think this is one of those issues were fence sitters are really going to jump off and decided to get themselves to the poll I I think it might be\nIt might be a related issue again about women's rights about the treatment of women under laws especially when it comes to matters of sexual assault so you might see\nMore women come out but I think that they were generally motivated to come anyway that's what the data tend to be showing us so far but\nThis is one of those things it's very fluid and you don't exactly know what's going to um to transpire until after we see some of the day after the election so this is one of those tricky things are I mean usually we see in mid term elections\nIssues related to um pocketbook issues and unemployment and employment issues and whether or not to people are feeling in effect of a growing or weakening economy\nFor for Donald Trump I think that's actually been a problem for him because even though the economy has been booming I mean we see that from statesmen statements from the fed 'em and from other economic announces\nHe's not really getting the kind of credit that he would he thinks he deserves and so if you're not getting credit on these kinds of issues I'm not sure whether or not\nOr Republicans are going to feel as if this is a reason that the Supreme Court nomination to get them to the polls it seems like there's sort of a lackluster approach to what is transpiring in the United states for Democrats that something totally different\nI mean they are just so angry that Hillary Clinton lost in twenty sixteen\nUh that I think that they're ... every little item that comes up in the news that seems to disparage Republicans and their governance is another reason for them to go so just stack this on the pile and will likely at least keep people interested through November elections\nThe um uh the so called swing vote a swing votes in the United States Senate or indicated that they found the extra background check that was done on I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes the fact that that investigation took place a add any credibility to now justice cabinet\nI I think in the minds of some it will because at least they they didn't rush headlong into a vote they did stop and so I think that you can give the Senate and its leadership some credit for at least listening to members who are concerned about the rumors that they had heard about a judge Kavanaugh and\nSo I I think it's going to give them some credibility but the problem of course is they did not give deep access to the report to individual members it hasn't been submitted to the public for their review and there are those who are criticizing the process because it was to brief investigation and one that didn't cover all of the\nThe major players in parties involved in the accusations that were made against judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so I think that are on the one hand people at least we'll say there were some measure of due process others will say it's a gigantic cover up and again this is going to split right down partisan lines I mean if you're if you look at some of the most recent Gallup poll data that the divide between Republicans and Democrats\nAs sort of reflecting the current polarization that we're saying so I'm not sure whether or not the FBI\nInvestigation is going to do anything but in trench those points of view of partisans on each side [noise] it it may help this way some of those a swing voters who are going to go to the polls\nAre because they may perceive this differently but again even Gallup shows that is split rather evenly in the United states that this is really just sort of a ... another clumsy partisan kind of event in in recent United States history that I'm not sure we can read the tea leaves very clearly until well after the fact\nOf the New York times reported that at one point of the White House told Brett Kavanaugh that if you wanted to save his nomination he needed to show how he felt\nHe uh uh responded to the testimony about sexual misconduct allegations by a breaking down yelling occasionally snapping senators on the Judiciary Committee\nOur Americans interpreting this and how well do you think that strategy worked for him\nI mean I I Would say at least in his own mind he may have regretted it considering his response a few days later in the wash in the wall Street Journal where he's trying to explain why he got that angry\nAnd I think part of the strategy there was at work very well for Justice Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One\nHe came out and he was accusing or the Senate in particular the Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee of what he called the high tech lynching it and I I think it really captured the imagination of the public it gave him something to reflect on about how hard it is for an individual like that\nTo to take these kinds of accusations and I think they Kevin always hopeful to do the same it's also a parallel strategy that Donald Trump himself uses and so Kavanaugh might have taken those two cues as something to pursue while giving his second testimony [noise]\nUm I'm not sure whether or not the public bought it I I I think that\nThat what we see is if that Thomas with a sympathetic figure in that situation Brett Kavanaugh who's perceived by many as among the elite um certainly of white rather than African American might have been perceived as a little bit too abrasive and that kind of situation especially the way he\nTreated some of the members of the the Judiciary Committee and I think that's why you saw sort of his almost apology in in the wall Street Journal now I suspect for some of Trump's supporters they were very happy to see him stand up for himself\nAs though this individual were being discriminated against by certain factions within the United states again I think this is going to split on partisan lines\nOr ... what lens you're looking at this kind of testimony through\nI think was in an almost no win situation if you don't fight back you'll look weak and you might not be perceived as explaining the accusations against you if you come out and you act like he did with his Dukes up and ready to fight it might be seen as too aggressive so he was really ... in many ways in a no win situation\nLet's take a call here Randy is with us from Madison Randy good morning thanks for joining us\nIs a good morning I'm I Do a ... just a lady response to what you just said that uh somehow I think the drama queen aspect or didn't serve them well either but I'm a other people are saying that did a I was bothered by the fact\nThat Ninety eight people when it came to voting they knew he had perjured himself on the\nIssues like his drinking his college days is attitude towards women and I'm\nFifty fifty of them said that's all right ah what ah what I Wish I was seeing is that somebody was calling on a judge Kavanaugh to say we please was draw for the good of the company of the country not\nCompany ... again like Randy thanks I Want to give a guess chance to respond and we're starting to run up behind Charlie tickets\nAt a Randy raises a very good point and in some senators were really beating the drum that we need more time to investigate and and\nIt was interesting about the way in which the Republicans were insist on rushing the way that they were obviously there's some nerves that they feel about what the polls are going to do to the majorities in the house in the Senate and November and so they wanted to make sure that they got their man and they got they got him sworn into office and so the whole perjury issues sort of swept under the rug\nProblem with perjury is\nIs trying to prove intent and in that kind of situation where he's trying to remember facts and figures from years back I'm not saying that you know if anyone has given permission to lie\nBut the argument can be made that he missed remembered or a ... would have liked his memory to be a sort of reminded of exactly what he did and said in the past\nRather than sort of gotcha questions so they are all sorts of issues that are raised with this should they have slowed down and maybe review these possibly there's an argument to be made but when Republicans were in control and driving a bus\nThey want to hit the accelerator as fast as they can the house can always come back in a patient proceedings if they gain the majority in has an investigated it may reveal nothing it may reveal something that could lead to articles of impeachment with potential removal by the Senate\nWe're just about out of time but if you could hit maybe the high points of what's coming on the Supreme Court docket this term and what cases might benefit from having a strong conservative majority\nYou know the the first part of this term is kind of a younger and and some are arguing that the reason is is that Roberts in the court decided to put some of the easier and less contentious cases early\nSo that uh if they had to wait for a ninth member to join they wouldn't have anything one of the blockbusters I think the biggest cases are going to be the gerrymandering cases including the one from Wisconsin a Kennedy was always sympathetic to at least hearing arguments to roll back some of\nThe um the laws and regulations\nThat we're giving advantage one party or the other cat does not seem as amenable to those arguments aren't as Kennedy was\nWe're gonna have to leave it there ... Jacobs thanks for joining us this morning I think John ... Jacobs is an associate professor of political science at Saint Norbert college into periods areas of expertise include American politics and judicial process I'm John months and it's the morning show on the ideas network [noise]\nYeah our research shows that uh alcohol and other drugs are are part of the problem I can tell you that\nFor example that people don't realize that when somebody has a has an overdose on staying opioid we gave a medication to help reverse that\nIt was not uncommon for us to be helping them brief but then put them in restraints for their own protection and ours when we gave the medication to reverse them because they come out of this they're very very violent frequently\nA and you can imagine with alcohol it's also common to have people that\nLose their inhibition and perpetrated violence against health care workers it's not uncommon that once they finally sober up\nThey're often very surprised at their own behavior\nWe're talking with Dr Terry ... chairman of emergency medicine at Oakland University William Beaumont school of medicine in Michigan he's been studying workplace violence in the emergency room for more than a decade\nI you mentioned earlier that to the ... the numbers we've been talking about a A R ah that's about doctors but I'm a suggestion here is that uh the the people who see patients first in the ER the nurses\nOr the or the workers at the front end of this operation are seeing even more do we have any idea what those numbers are like\nYeah so um or citizen tax ah definitely have experienced a greater approval has to have a great prevalence of violence perpetrated against them and our research shows that really there's a direct correlation between the amount of time you spend with a patient um and then the having increased incidents of violence\nSo nurses [noise] um it's almost a hundred percent with what we found and if you look at some of the studies ours ours have shown that\nAssaulted at least once and the previous year and many of them more than that and as I said before physicians actually although not immune to it their numbers are lower than it out of the nurses and tax\nSo well I I Want to invite our listeners to join us as well or the listeners do you work in an emergency room have you experienced violence on the job and how to do to impact your life boat in and out of the ER eight hundred six more two one two three four\nEight hundred six four to one two three four ideas that WPRI dot org use the email address you can also tweet us at WNPR mornings\nA doctor ... do you said that the uh the increase in violence or that you're you're seeing in the research could be in part due to employees reporting abuse more often or why would the tempted to themselves before\nSo there is an old a two reasons that we found out that there was under reporting first of all we know that there is on a reporting even today but it's better today than it was even a decade ago\nI'm part of it was that it was a potentially ... an owner is process and you can imagine if you're a nurse who just finished a twelve hour shifts and you were shut out during the shift\nBut you weren't physically hurt by it you might not take the time to fill out some sort of a form to report it and the other things we've we've found or that\nThere was a fear that if you report it\nMore often people might think of you as the problem you can imagine that have two different people have different thresholds for what the report one reports everything and the other one report nothing\nIf you're an administrator looking at these reports and you see one name keeps keeps coming up it may actually think that that may be that person may be the problem when in fact they are not a problem there just reporting more often\nDo we do we have a sense of of how under reported this abuse has been in any aren't setting\nYeah so um the is our number show that it's only the reporting rated probably less than fifty percent and uh and and actually when you look at that that just reporting to the hospital\nWhen you look at actual reporting to police every study we've had has been less than five percent of the time do they report anything to the police\n... well I suppose you're going back to your uh your earlier comments about why they don't report they're reporting that police will just increase the amount of paperwork and the time they would have to spend after the fact uh to to deal with this\nAnd there's also a fear of retribution either from the perpetrator or from work itself if they continue to go forward the other groups of people that we know are under reported are groups where we as health care professionals um\nRealize that they're not under their control so for example small children or a older adults with dementia frequently if you're starting an IV or something like that it's painful to that person ... react\nAnd they can't caused by they can react in a violent manner and we know that those instances are almost never reported\nA ... I Would like to start at least having a conversation here about the actual effect of this physical abuse on ER workers were coming up to a a pause in the program here's who will probably continue this afterwards but\nLet's talk about the impact of this uh this abuse on E R workers I'm assuming there's a physical toll what the what is the physical toll here\nDepending on what ended up happening to uh to the person I mean I've seen everything from a person having uh\nOut to um be slashed and cut with a broken a computer screen and then use that as a weapon against some are nurses so the extent of physical violence really is [noise] run the gamut\nBeyond the physical damage there is a psychological component\nAfter certainly either a victim of a violent act and just be aware of it and I can tell you that with some of the briefings that we've done with ... like this is not uncommon that all the witnesses\nSuffer significantly from it as well mhm\nWe know that there's issues better psychological and urban plenty of studies have shown there's been instances of it yesterday and then not infrequently uh especially among the nursing staff um they they look to find a different position somewhere else\nAnd I I Want to continue that part of the conversation or as we as the program moved former here Dr Terry ... is our guest who's the chairman of emergency medicine at Oakland University William Beaumont school of medicine in Michigan [noise] this is the morning show on the ideas that were [noise]\n\nChecking the WPRI weather forecast for today cloudy with rain likely some isolated thunderstorms are possible warmer with hives from the low sixties to near eighty mostly cloudy on Tuesday rain and the few thunderstorms possible in the north and west of the state highs from a low seventies to around eighty\nMore rain and thunderstorms expected on Wednesday with hives from the low sixties to low seventies and for Thursday clearing and much cooler with hides from the mid forties to mid fifties\nUp next on the morning show is the state capital report our guest is a political scientist who breaks down the race between democratic US Senator Kennedy Baldwin and Republican challenger Leah Vukmir that's ahead on the morning show\nWe like to match our side we try to match furnishings in our homes we even match with\nThat has your employer match your donation to Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nTo see if your company has a matching gifted program go to W.

damage Joseph ... is a democratic strategist who's worked on a number of campaigns in Wisconsin He says prices responded well to those attacks\nMainstream Republican line on this which is a she would have supported as confirmation a and also then you know that going some of the points made about\nNot having any cooperation of any other witnesses and saying this is not fair to\nJudge Kavanaugh's a legacy and his integrity and his long career but he's had on the court and so this is a really polarizing issue right now looking for the base is probably the issue that is galvanizing both Democrats or Republicans more than anything we've seen in the last month or two\nBut it really riled up of the Democratic base initially um and now just in the last week after President Trump came out and attack Dr Ford it seems to have also now galvanized the Republican base in a way\nA unfair attack I was given a cabinet has been confirmed you'd think that perhaps the anger over him being on the court should\nPerhaps motivate Democrats more than Republicans at this point because Republicans were able to to get their nominee will have to see how that plays out\nHow is gender playing into a tune to the Senate race or or is it not coming up at all\n[noise] well it it seems to not you know come up as as much as as you might think but I think it is something that uh probably it home for the Republicans have been having a woman running against Henry ball then cause a bomb on\nA has run very strong ah across the state of an appeal not only for women but done pretty well with a with male voters as well and so to have a nuclear running as a challenger against Tammy Baldwin a could perhaps reduce the gender gap\nTo some extent and will I think see perhaps a record signs ... nationally in this midterm election because of a cab not because of Donald Trump\nUntil it to the extent that live near can reduce the gender gap for Republicans Wisconsin gives them at least a something of a chance there'd be able to have a competitive race against Andrew Baldwin\nLet's take a call from Mary who joined us from Milwaukee Mary thanks for joining us on the morning show\nWell thank you very much thanks Jon thank your guest um what I wanted to bring up is I rarely watch the commercials any commercials much less political because I'm not going to get my education and information from them um many times they are mud slinging\nBut with a live ... trying to blame for instance Tammy Baldwin um they set the current senator\nWho's done a fine job I'm going to look into her what she has really gone it seems like many times some mudslinging comes from the right a little bit more and I'm In the toll on my case for instance Tammy Baldwin certainly wouldn't\nDo a cover up and has not done a cover up\nOf what's going on with the um uh you know the medicine at the VA until among them um that's my point is I don't think a whole lot of people actually get their education or I Hope they don't want for for the people that really fault\nSo uh marry for you ads don't make a difference so you you do your own research\nExactly and I listen to NPR and get the experts advises\nOkay well thank you uh David cannon\nGo vote or or do a lot of people really get their information from a ads they see on TV\nWell sadly I'm Mary is is not the typical voter as a plot or and and I wish more voters were like married to their own research and and looked into things and not leave everything they see on on ads because one really important point she she makes is that\nThe ads typically will have like some kernel of truth but then blow it up in a way that ends up being a very misleading and so to take that tell them that example in one of the book or as\nYou know basically add blame Sandy Baldwin a for you're not looking into this quickly enough\nTo save this one a veteran who died well it turns out he died like a day after she got the report and so there's no way that she could have possibly intervene quickly enough to prevent that specific deaths and so that's the kind of thing that they Mary's referring to that often these ads are are very misleading now unfortunately research has shown that\nThese ads do work that people do pay attention to as I think it's less so today than it would have been say six eight years ago because more people now are you know on the Internet on social media and so the actual broadcast ads are not as effective as they were say six eight years ago\nWell in a lot of people are using a digital video recording equipment and uh you know if you have a T ball box for example you can hit a button and skip right through the entire at cost her and get back to the show All right a lot more of that as well\nIdaho and no doubt and that's one reason or another reason that the broadcast ads are as effective as they used to be\nSo we know that there's a lot of money being spent on this you mentioned that a lot of it is coming from outside groups or how much money are we talking about do we have a sense of the total number of dollars being spent and where it's coming from\nYeah we do so the the last ... reporting period that you see they still haven't posted the September thirtieth recording career to last we have is from uh July twenty fifth that he's even as of July twenty fifth um to have all had raised over twenty two million dollars\nUm and ... campaign was just getting going at that point and she only raised about two million I'm sure those numbers can be much higher by the uh September reporting period\nBut the outside spending already at the end of July Tammy Baldwin had over seven and a half million dollars spent against her and only one point seven bent are in favor of her\nOr and so the outside dollars are going to be well over double that by the time we get to the end of the race on election day\nThe latest Marquette University law school poll released mid September ... had ... within eleven point lead which was a big bump from the ... previous\nOr a new Marquette poll is set to release this week you do you think anything's happened in recent weeks that will move the needle for a for either from either candidate David Kennan\nYeah I Would expect a the numbers should stay probably the same same range or low double digits high single digit lead for\nFor ... fifty three forty two last time and one thing that's noteworthy about that number for mid September is only five percent undecided now that many weeks out before the election which is\nIs pretty low some most voters have made up their mind already you know often in a race you'll see eight nine ten percent undecided still in September but the fact that we're down to just a five percent undecided\nAlready a couple of weeks ago I mean this is a race that I think getting a lot of attention but also voters are pretty locked in in terms of who they prefer he'll probably won't see too much movement in this next pulled us released\nWhat could either candidate do at this point to attract that small sliver of undecided voters to their side of the ballot\nWell I think they're more crucial thing actually\nVoter turnout that at this point not that many people are changing their minds the key thing is getting your voters the whole I think that's one thing that both Democrats and Republicans are focused on here in Wisconsin but also nationally\nUm just given that most people don't vote in midterm elections nationally this is a where the focus is going to be over the last several weeks of getting your voters to the polls\nThat show which raises the bigger driver of getting people to the polls this one or the or the governor's race\nThat's a great question it's not that often that you have to really hotly contested elections like this and uh I Would say there are probably both equally motivating for for most voters and likes to the ball to erase the\nUh the ... race also uh is getting a lot of tension but also has both sides pretty much locked in here that\nScott Walker has been around long enough that every voter and Wisconsin as a an opinion whether they like him or don't like him so you're not going to be seeing too many voters changing their minds especially in the governor's race I think uh and there again it's going to be all about voter turnout\nYeah at the end well I guess there's some question as to who helped to more just Baldwin help ... mourners ... Baltimore's same thing with a book mayor and Governor Walker and and those are certainly things we could probably spend another hour talking about but we don't have time so we won't\nUh what else are you going to be watching for in tonight's debate you said that there would be a a lot of there would be some talk about how to work with the other party and and maybe he'll some of the divide what else are you looking for in tonight's debate\nWell one thing I Would expect Kennedy ball and to do is trying to link look nearer to Donald Trump Donald Trump is not popular in Wisconsin the latest luck at all had him at a forty two percent favorable fifty four percent unfavorable which is pretty comparable to the\nNational numbers and nationally and here in Wisconsin as well you see in the mid term elections voters wanting to have a check on Donald Trump that so even if Trump is on the ballot he's very much a looming presence in this election and and Democrats are trying to get their voters motivated by this idea of we need something to stop Donald Trump and\nSo I Would expect Tammy Baldwin to try to link look nearer to Trump and to say that you know she would be a voice in support of the president I wouldn't be surprised at\nThe mere tries to distance herself a bit for the president but it's a difficult balancing\nAct for her because she doesn't want to alienate that strong base of supporters and so she has to be pretty careful how she does that she wants to buy the book fairs opposite independent boys a yet not alienating the the ... supporters\nDavid cannon uh thank you very much for joining us this morning [noise] that's a good to be with you David Kennedy was a professor of political science at the University of Madison coming up next we check in on how the state is addressing the spread of chronic wasting disease and what the governor hopes to do about it I'm John months in in the morning show on the ideas that were\nIn a well rich hang on we have a caller uh Dwayne who I think has a wants to weigh in on this uh he's calling us from Hayward let's take ... call now and joins with welcome to the morning show\nThat's all tense and all inclusive and doesn't have any common sense into it I have friends on farms that county line runs through the middle of the far\nSo they would be breaking your last day shot Iran one part of the farm and took a process that far far it'd be more like something well if you have five miles from the line or something like that because they are all inclusive\nYou can't you shall not to run across all the time when you're close to\nThe way no thanks thanks for that call what about it I mean how were the uh how are they going to determine what the boundaries were for an area that is you know how you define an area defected by cw D. and and put that on a map\nRight even that is it's a bit confusing for people who don't you know follow it constantly like us reporters are some lawmakers or whatever but um so if it's the county has an ... or they find a positive for cw ... there was one in Oakland County for example\nUm then the DNR looks at that so that old Clare county would be cw the affected but also any county within ten miles circle of that is also considered a cw the affected because deer do tend to move a bit [noise]\nUm and that's where some of the confusion would have been I mean the the hunters would have really had to have looked\nAt the latest cw the maps to see where there's fifty five counties that are are listed as cw the affected so they're definitely could have been some some real confusion and also because of the rule was set to go into effect immediately for these this year's hunting seasons um the question was well are the DNR\nWardens going to start issuing you know citations because there's a learning period you know so uh it was unclear whether or not they were going to strictly enforce that or not but nonetheless the rule is gone so for this on things season at least it's not\nIs a WNPR reporter based in oak layer he's been following the cw di story for Wisconsin Public radio or were wondering what do you think should be done about to chronic wasting disease and what you thought of the governors proposed emergency rule\nUh end up perhaps also the uh the rules about fencing for deer farms eight hundred six four too\nHe'll work with the legislature to reintroduce his emergency rule do we uh have any idea what will be different this time around\nI asked him that about two days just after the the board voted to kill his part of his rule and\nHe said he was going to work with the legislature on that and then re introducing it he didn't say I tried to get him to to specify whether that would be through the normal rule making process or through legislation he just said that you know he would work with law makers and reintroduce it the the the ... during the hearing on these rules\nA lot of people that were for the the the a carcass transport ban and also for the cw D. or for the fencing bat a requirements they were saying if we don't act now it's not going to happen we've seen this come up\nPolitically before and then when people say they're going to address it in the next session it never happened so that's part of the justification folks that want it to see these emergency rules in effect instantly\nMhm meanwhile a rule that did go through the deer fencing requirement where are we on that\nWell that is an interesting one to because the the fencing requirement rule once it goes into effect it to the deer farms\nAre that have had cw the positives you know they're they're required already to have double fencing but this one would require enhanced fencing in any county that has lifted the cw the affected [noise] um and also I so that\nRule will go into effect they've got three hundred and sixty five days to comply with the rule but because it's an emergency rule ... the rules [laughter] I'm San rosel at\nThe emergency rules are only on the books for a hundred and fifty days or so there's a possibility for extension so the question is whether or not this emergency rule goes away before these deer farms or hunting ranches even have to come into compliance Mm\n[noise] so ah the main while they're more than half of well that sounds like about three quarters of the counties in Wisconsin affected by sea WD\nHow how are people reacting to what transpired regarding these rules and a ... I imagine there most of the reaction would be within the hunting community and and those who follow this issue a closely\nIt's interesting some I mean you've got some people who are very concerned about cw D a decimated the deer heard and then you've got other hunting groups that and\nOf course the people that points to southern Wisconsin that had this you know they've got huge amounts of cw de down there but yet they point out that the deer heard is actually increased um that is a complicated situation because now there's county deer advisory councils that are committees that\nVote to a grow the herd or reduce the herd so there's some human factor in there as well but [noise] um there's there's it's just it's such a polarizing issue and and you know back in the early to thousands when it first broke out\nThere was huge reaction and lately it seems like a lot of people don't seem as worried about it\n[noise] well and the deer hunting a a a major piece of Wisconsin's a welder traditions in this state does well as being a pretty a sizable amount of money that's spent on it a lot of people involved in it\nAnd certainly uh certainly has been a big issue in the legislature at least in terms of what people are likely to say about it and uh uh I Know rich that you'll be you'll be following this story a very quickly here what do you think will happen next to any nothing's gonna happen before the election right\nNothing before the election um and what will be interesting is whether or not this carcass or transport ban is introduced\nA wheel a rich Kramer stays with us She's or Wisconsin Public radio reporter based at all clear at when we come back we'll talk about rats and minding I'm John months and this is the morning show on the ideas don't work [noise]\n[noise] checking the W.

Norbert college and appear is areas of expertise include American politics and the judicial process Charlie thanks for joining us this morning on the morning show\nMy pleasure John\nSo it's been one heck of a political weekend what's different now from forty eight hours ago\nA different now is that just as Kevin all arrive at his chambers he'll start working on the business of the court which really kicked off about a week ago\nWhen the session began although of course the court and uh it's that's been working for a long time in the near term we're not going to see any significant change in what is occurring on the court they'll do their business as usual we have to wait for is the announcement of some opinions and some opinions that will give us some sort of signal about\nHow he is behaving whether or not he is a voting at a consistent fashion either in a liberal direction or the conservative direction\nAnd with whom he is voting so\nThe blocks of justice is that he is working with to come up with a particular decision\nSo ... there's going to be a leg here we're not really going to do much and really the blockbuster cases in any term of the United States Supreme court they don't come until June anyway because they typically fit on them while they work on the language and the interpretation of the law so\nFor most of us who study the court\nWe have to wait until the until we get some data to work with the exactly what's going on\nAs a practical matter I mean what's the real timeline for justice cabinet yes he's sworn in yes he's a member of the court yes you'll be in in his office ah what's the ... there'll be some ramping up ah what's the process for\nI don't think it's going to really change those individuals much except get them more excited may drive them to do a little bit more work to get more people to the polls I mean typically what we see in midterm elections is a lower turnout for Democrats who tend to come out in greater numbers in in the presidential election years [noise] so the hope is is that they can really\nDrive a get out the vote campaign to get people there\nThis may spur some Democrats but I don't think this is one of those issues were fence sitters are really going to jump off and decided to get themselves to the poll I I think it might be\nIt might be a related issue again about women's rights about the treatment of women under laws especially when it comes to matters of sexual assault so you might see more women come out but I think that they were generally motivated to come anyway that's what the data tend to be showing us so far but this is one of those things it's very fluid and you don't exactly know\nWhat's going to um transpire until after we see some of the data after the election\nSo this is one of those tricky things are I mean usually we see in mid term elections issues related to um pocketbook issues and unemployment and employment issues and whether or not people are feeling in effect of a growing or weakening economy [noise]\nUh for for Donald Trump I think that's actually been a problem for him because even though the economy has been booming we see that from statesmen statements from the fed\n'em and from other economic analysis he's not really getting the kind of credit that he would he thinks he deserves and so if you're not getting credit on these kinds of issues I'm not sure whether or not\nA Republicans are going to feel as if this is a reason that the Supreme Court nomination to get them to the polls it seems like there's sort of a lack lust\nStates for Democrats if something totally different I mean they are just so angry that Hillary Clinton lost in twenty sixteen\nOr that I think that they're ... every little item that comes up in the news that seems to disparage Republicans and their governance is another reason for them to go so just stack this on the pile and will likely at least keep people interested through November elections\nThe um uh the so called swing vote a swing votes in the United States Senate or indicated that they found the extra background check that was done on I'm Brett Kavanaugh thorough\nOr does that mean does the fact that that investigation took place a add any credibility to now justice cabin oh\nI I think in the minds of some it will because at least they they didn't rush headlong into a vote they did stop and so I think that you can give the Senate and its leadership some credit for at least listening to members who are concerned about the rumors that they had heard about a judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so I I think it's going to give them some credibility but the problem of course is\nThey did not give deep access to the report to individual members it hasn't been submitted to the public for their review and there are those who are criticizing the process because it was\nTo brief investigation and one that didn't cover all of the the major players in parties involved in the accusations that were made against judge Kavanaugh and so I I think that\nI'm On the one hand people at least we'll say there were some measure of due process\nOthers will say it's a gigantic cover up and again this is going to split right down partisan lines I mean if you're if you look at some of the most recent Gallup poll data that the divide between Republicans and Democrats a sort of reflecting the current polarization that we're saying so I'm not sure whether or not the FBI\nInvestigation is going to do anything but entrenched those points of view\nOf partisans on each side [noise] it it may help this way some of those a swing voters who are going to go to the polls\nUm because they may perceive this differently but again even ... shows that is split rather evenly in the United states that this is really just sort of a a ... another clumsy part is kind of event in in recent United States history that I'm not sure we can read the tea leaves very clearly until well after the fact\nOf the New York times reported that at one point of the White House told a Brett Kavanaugh that if you wanted to save his nomination he needed to show how he felt\nHe uh uh responded to the testimony about sexual misconduct allegations of by a breaking down yelling occasionally snapping at senators on the Judiciary Committee\nHoller Americans interpreting this and how well do you think that strategy worked for him\nI mean I I Would say at least in his own mind he may have regretted it considering his response a few days later in the wash it in the wall Street Journal where he's trying to explain why he got that angry [noise]\nAnd I think part of the strategy there was at work very well for Justice Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One um he came out and and he was accusing\nOr the Senate in particular the Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee of what he told the high tech lynching it and I I think it really captured the imagination of the public it gave them something to reflect on about how hard it is for an individual like that to to take these kinds of accusations\nAnd I think they Kevin always hopeful to do the same it's also a parallel strategy that Donald Trump himself uses and so cabinet might have taken those two cases as something to pursue while giving his second testimony [noise]\nUm I'm not sure whether or not the public bought it I I think that that what we see is is that Thomas with a sympathetic figure in that situation Brett Kavanaugh who's perceived by many as among the elites\nRather than African American might have\nBeen perceived as a little bit too abrasive and that kind of situation especially the way he treated some of the members of the the Judiciary Committee and I think that's why you saw sort of his almost apology in in the wall Street Journal now I suspect for some of Trump's supporters they were very happy to see him stand up for himself\nA as though this individual were being discriminated against by certain factions within the United states again I think this is going to split on partisan lines\nOr ... what lens you're looking at this kind of testimony through social\nJustice Kevin I I think was in an almost a no win situation if you don't fight back you'll look weak and you might not be perceived as explaining the accusations against you if you come out and you act like he did with his Dukes up and ready to fight it might be seen as too aggressive so he was really in many ways in a no win situation\nLet's take a call here Randy is with us from Madison Randy good morning thanks for joining us\nIs a good morning I'm\nI I uh ... just a leader as far as to what you just said that uh somehow I think the drama queen aspect or didn't serve him well either but I'm a other people are saying that did\nA I was

again like Randy thanks I Want to give a guess chance to respond and we're starting to run on time you're Charlie tickets\nAt a rainy raises a very good point and in some senators were really beating the drum that we need more time to investigate and and\nIt was interesting about the way in which the Republicans were insist on rushing the way that they were obviously there's some nerves that they feel about what the polls are going to do to the majorities in the house and the Senate and November\nAnd so they wanted to make sure that they got their man and they got they got him sworn into office and so the whole perjury issues sort of was swept under the rug\nProblem with perjury is is trying to prove intent and in that kind of situation where he's trying to remember facts and figures from years back I'm not saying that you know if anyone has given permission to lie\nBut the argument can be made that he missed remembered or a ... would have liked his memory to be a sort of reminded of exactly what he did and said in the past rather than sort of gotcha question so they're all sorts of issues that are raised with this should they have slowed down and maybe review these possibly there's an argument to be made\nBut when Republicans were in control in driving the bus\nThey want to hit the accelerator as fast as they can the house can always come back in impeachment proceedings if they gain the majority in the has investigated it may reveal nothing it may reveal something that could lead to articles of impeachment with potential removal by the Senate\nWe're just about all the time but if you could hit maybe the high points of what's coming on the Supreme Court docket this term and what cases might benefit from having a strong conservative majority\n[laughter] you know the the first part of this term is kind of a younger and and some are arguing that the reason is is that Roberts and the court decided to put some of the easier and less contentious cases early so that or if they had to wait for a ninth member to join they wouldn't have anything one of the blockbusters\nI think the biggest cases are going to be the gerrymandering cases including the one from Wisconsin a Kennedy was always sympathetic to at least hearing arguments\nThe uh the laws and regulations that we're giving advantage one party or the other cat does not seem as amenable to those arguments as Kennedy was\nWe're going to have to leave with their ... Jacobs thanks for joining us this morning thank you John ... Jacobs is an associate professor of political science at Saint Norbert college into periods areas of expertise include American politics and judicial process on John months and it's the morning show on the ideas that were [noise]\nYeah our research shows that uh alcohol and other drugs are are part of the problem I can tell you that\nFor example that people don't realize that when somebody has a has an overdose on say an opioid we gave a medication to help reverse that\nIt was not uncommon for us to be helping them free but then\nPut them in restraints for their own protection and ours when we gave the medication to reverse them because they come out of this they're very very violent frequently I and you can imagine with alcohol it's also common to have people lose their innovation and perpetrated violence against health care workers\nIt's not uncommon that once they finally sober up\nThey're often very surprised at their own behavior\nWe're talking with Dr Terry ... chairman of emergency medicine at Oakland University William Beaumont school of medicine in Michigan he's been studying workplace violence in the emergency room for more than a decade\nI you mentioned earlier that the the numbers we've been talking about a A R that's about doctors but I'm a suggestion here\nThe people who see patients first in the ER the nurses [noise] uh the uh the the workers at the front end of this operation are seeing even more do we have any idea what those numbers are like\nYeah so um or citizen tax ah definitely have experienced a greater approval is to have a great prevalence of violence perpetrated against them and our research shows that really there's a direct correlation between the amount of time you spend with a patient um and then the having increased incidents of violence\nSo with our nurses [noise] um it's almost a hundred percent with what we found and if you look at some of the studies ours ours have shown that\nAre up to sixty percent haven't physically assaulted at least once and the previous year and many of them more than that and as I said before physicians actually although they're not immune to it their numbers are lower than that of the nurses and the tax\nSo well I I Want to invite our listeners to join us as well or the listeners do you work in an emergency room have you experienced violence on the job and how to do to impact your life boat in and out of the ER eight hundred six four to one two three four\nEight hundred six four to one two three four ideas that WPRI dot org use the email address you can also tweet us at WNPR mornings\nA doctor ... you said that the uh the increase in violence or that you're you're seeing in the research could be in part due to employees reporting abuse more often oh why would the tempted to themselves before\nSo there's an old a two reasons that we found that there was on to reporting for what we know that there is on a reporting even today but it's better today than it was even a decade ago I'm part of it was that it was\nA potentially ... an owner as process and you can imagine if you're a nurse who just finished a twelve hour shift and you were shoved during the shift\nBut you weren't physically hurt by it\nYou might not take the time to fill out some sort of a form to report it and the other things we've we've found or that there was a fear that if you reported it more often\nPeople might think of you as the problem you can imagine that have two different people have different thresholds for what the report one report everything and the other one report nothing if you're an administrator looking at these reports and you see one name keeps keeps coming up\nIt may actually think that that may be that person may be the problem when in fact they are not a problem there just reporting more often\nDo we do we have a sense of of how under reported this abuse has been in any aren't setting\nYeah so um the is our number show that it's only the recording rated probably less than fifty percent\nAnd uh and and actually when you look at that that just reporting to the hospital when you look at actual reporting to police every study we've had have been less than five percent of the time do they report anything to the police\n... well I was going back to your uh your earlier comments about why they don't report their reporting the police would just increase the amount of paperwork and the time they would have to spend after the fact ah to to deal with this\nAnd there's also a fear of retribution either from the perpetrator or from work itself if they continue to go forward the other groups of people that we know are under reported are groups where we as health care professionals um\nRealize that they're not under their control so for example small children or a older adults with dementia frequently if you're starting an ivy\nThey react and they can cause I can react in a violent manner and we know those instances are almost never reported\nA ... I Would like to start at least having a conversation here about the actual effect of this physical abuse on ER workers were coming up to a pause in the program here so will probably continue this afterwards but\nLet's talk about the impact of this ah this abuse on E R workers a ... I'm assuming there's a physical toll what what is the physical toll here\nSo depending on what ended up happening to uh to the person I mean I've seen everything from a person having a facial bones broken into two knocked out\nTo um be slashed and cut with a broken computer screen and then use that as a weapon against some are nurses so the extent of physical violence really is [noise] run the gamut\nBut the physical damage there is a psychological component and you don't even have to have a victim of a violent act and just need to be aware of it and I can tell you that with some of the briefings that we've done with them when they're having is like this\nIs not uncommon that\nAll the witnesses suffer from it as well ...\nYou know that there's issues that are psychological and there have been plenty of studies have shown there's been instances of it yesterday and then not infrequently uh especially among the nursing staff um if they they look to find a different position somewhere else\nAnd I I Want to continue that part of the conversation or as we as the program moved former here Dr Terry ... is our guest he's the chairman of emergency medicine at Oakland University William Beaumont school of medicine in Michigan [noise] this is the morning show on the ideas that were [noise]\n\nChecking the WPRI weather forecast for today cloudy with rain likely some isolated thunderstorms are possible warmer with hides from the low sixties to near eighty mostly cloudy on Tuesday rain in the few thunderstorms possible in the north and west to the state's highest from a low seventies to around eighty\nMore rain and thunderstorms expected on Wednesday with hides from the low sixties to low seventies and for Thursday clearing and much cooler with hides from the mid forties to mid fifties\nComing up after the morning show is on point we're broadcasting from Philadelphia where we'll get top reporters views on what story to be another big leak in the news plus a conversation about redistricting all that more after nine o'clock\nEvery day on central time we celebrate my been Wisconsin and what our state has given to the nation and the world\nFrom Georgia O'Keefe to Les Paul we learn about Wisconsin I passed in President made their Martin tune into central time for a look at the people who make our state and great place to call home weekday afternoon from three until seven or online anytime as WPRI dot org and\nSupport for WPRI comes from ... in Vernon County Wisconsin with two hundred and fifty miles of classified trout water sixty three spring creeks and several lakes for walleye bass in pike ...
