article\nWhy Halloween pop ups suddenly possess so many dead retail spaces\nTaylor welcome to the morning show they were having me in the in the lead up to a today Halloween and out and even after we often see Halloween pop up stories taking spots that once housed big box retailers like toys are us we're Circuit City\nDealer how long of Halloween pop up shop spin around\nSo the first one was opened up by the man who eventually open Spencers Ninety three I actually originally owned a women's clothing store and decided to toss in like some Batman mask\nAnd fake blood a and he had a huge success with that and the early eighties and started operating a few more pop up stores but they didn't really become popular and and have a lot of other competitive chains until the mid to late nineties\nSo there are actual chains of these pop up shops what are some of the main ones\nSpirit Halloween is by far the biggest uh this year they're actually even more than Thirteen hundred at twenty five spirit stores in the U.S and they have\nThank you John it's nice to be here\nTell us about the Milwaukee Streetcar what does this record a car looked like what kind of vehicle is this and how does it run\nA ... a a two and a mile stretch and ... now has two routes ... around in the downtown area and has asked most bird to a dynamic front\nAnd you can think of that ... as a third I think that's a very loud check and it's a virus more than building it has the hop symbol on the car so it's got to be interesting to read it\nAnd it runs on electricity over tracks\nYes or a rise out and actually stay over to track\nIt people in Wisconsin may still be familiar with street cars those who are old enough and I guess I Would have to count myself as one of those others may have encountered trolleys\nOr in in some cities what's the difference between a what do we think of history cars or trolleys and what the uh the hop is in Milwaukee\nI think technology wise there is no much difference and it runs on to fix track it has a very small space in between the stops sit you can hop on hop off going to a different destinations very easily\nUm to my understanding is just a name which on a street car that basically means technology wise the same thing of course we have when you are clean our technology for short now\nAnd but this isn't a this isn't my grandfather's a streetcar they were bumpy and noisy and uncomfortable a tell us about these modern street cars what are they like inside\nA it's going to be learned Clyde and they're right it's got to be very smooth I haven't tried out and I'm going to try out our hub\nThis coming weekend but when I ride on the street carts across the country or they are very comfortable and you can see the streets gaping you can see people walking by it can be very pleasant\nAnd how many people can ride on these at one time\nA U.S feel how do you think that we are as chest petition professional as we are talking about daily that shape and they expected the right shape it around the thousand a day\nSo now that we understand what\nAbout the primary purpose of the Milwaukee Streetcar why does it exist\nOh well we've been talking about streetcar all a real transit system for a long time [noise] uh\nSo they phoned in actually the federal funding came to Milwaukee in Nineteen Ninety One so when the Ice T the a multiple year federal refunding federal law was passed during that time and the law was to encourage multi ... a safe\nTransportation system for all people so along with other larger metropolitan areas like Los Angeles like the sea Milwaukee also get a big chunk of federal funds to support a expensive\nTransit system in Milwaukee but over at the time the said they didn't have the matching found\nAnd a day discussion of a real it's real transit system has been going on for years until ten to Fifteen so that was when uh the time that the common cause of Milwaukee approved the current scope off the street car that's the streetcar we see today with a two and half a mile stretch\nSo it is part of the ... is part of the reason for this thing to exist to attract a tourism or to get people to come to downtown Milwaukee something else uh what uh what uh what's the goal here\nUh I guess they'll go the larger goal as economic development so the goal is slightly different from\nThirty almost Thirty years ago at that time we were talking about transportation support transportation access to\nJobs to opportunities right now I think the goal is more um um improve the image of Milwaukee and serving right now with the um they tried half mile distance serving the downtown ...\nResidents I'm sure a curious and visitors to downtown can enjoy the convenience writes ah the coming into service probate provided by the streetcar [noise]\nShow for our listeners who aren't in Milwaukee give us some background this has been in the works since the early nineties and uh what finally a tip the scales and made this thing a reality\n[noise] I think as they perception and acceptance of transit service is a four years uh there is a perception um transit and there is a perception that\nReal transit is going to be super expensive and it can be costly for the residents and they serve\nHigher income people are those people leaving in downtime connecting to the suburbs I'm over the years we realized that we cannot rely on private automobiles\nAre the streets are getting congested the air quality is getting a worse than was the emission from the cars so residents in Milwaukee it seems to me are more and more acceptable to a environmental frankly convenient transit services\nAnd we know that transit is not as a way I'm\nAs a way a perceived as slow as efficient and transit is more convenient and serving a different residents and gave very community services or access to a lot of different opportunities so I think Milwaukee residents are\nAccepting a new mode of a new phase of transit\nI just wanted to bring up like in addition to the streetcar Milwaukee is also seeking grants to build the first bus rapid transit system in Milwaukee so we're talking about a lot of different modes of transit now\nI mean who is chair of the department of ... a professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee school of architecture and urban planning we're talking about the new Milwaukee St card\nOn the ... there's a starting this Friday there uh opening it up to the public and you can check that out if you were in Milwaukee\nOf the uh the the streetcar in Milwaukee moves on city streets the official website details that goes between twenty five and thirty miles per hour in stops every three to four blocks what are some safety concerns people raised with history car sharing the street with buses and cars\n[noise] ah we've seen some small accidents already the main reason is that people haven't got used to a big trading on the street and it's a mixed traffic [noise]\nUm I guess the only thing we can do is just be aware of street car just imagine just know that is a big trading or the magic is a big check\nDo not stop suddenly in front of the election do not turn right in front of the gene those are the things that we need to consider one way or aware there is a big chain uh reading next to us\nAnd what about ah people a pedestrian shore bicycle is a horrible visuals making sure that they aren't are in danger\nI there are a lot of new pacman and knew a\n... a new designs a features to make sure that people are aware that the trend is coming and ... can cross the street to simulate a watching out for the ... and frankly when people get used to the street car and when people get used to the mix traffic\nIt's gonna be potential they it's going to be safer if I'll be that's inside bicyclists eighth district car can reduce automobile traffic on the streets [noise]\nUm we've seen we've seen a lot of health a successful examples across the country when the streets are more open to translate 'em reduce they traffic of private automobile is that encourage people walking biking on the streets that's going to increase the safety\nAnd speaking of bicycles some a bicycle riders aren't happy with the trolley or what the what the streetcar because their tires have gotten wedge during the streetcar tracks have we seen other complaints already\nYeah we've seen complains about bicyclists get tired in a track 'em and people are also worried about uh how to get a their bikes on off the train but that's going to be sorted out very easily\nAnd up the bicycle is probably can also say that if they're really worried about their tires they can consider alternative paper routes or so is that up using um the streets to waste the straight talk track they can go to the next block\nAnd we also have I'm Sorry we also have a they buy tracks are around us station areas and helping to helping people to transfer from bicycle into the new streetcar\nProfessor who stays with us talking about the Milwaukee Streetcar what do you think about the streak card is to hop a good investment or or not\nOr what do you think about the areas that it covers do you think it's too small an area or is it just right are you excited to ride the uh the hop in Milwaukee what makes you want to experience this unique mode of transportation or maybe you plan to stay as far away from it as you can well either way\nTell us why maybe you live in a community that has a streetcar what are the advantages are saying what are the challenges you encounter\nYou can hop on the radio with us it eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas of WNPR dot org has the email address and you can tweet us at WNPR morning It's MORNING show on the ideas network on John ... [noise]\nI see the point and I understand the concern um first a large part of the founding of including the capital cost as we were seeing a close to a hundred million dollars ... now\nAnd a large part of the operating costs although it's through point if I mean every year they most of them are provided are funded by the federal government so we got the funding to do that\nUm and it's a small part of the uh capital costs and the operating costs will come up from the fair and will come from they pay for a tax incremental financing\nA let's say some in the city of Milwaukee the expectation is that\nThe streetcar can improve the property value and it can increase the attractiveness of the downtown [noise] a lot of people going to enjoy urban life and streetcar conflict actually provide\nThat atmosphere that amenities for people to see Milwaukee CD as a revived\nAs a very lively city uh in that sense a again streetcar as a tool to um improve the economy and potentially bring a lot of tax dollars money into the day which can be used\nLater on to a lot of um [noise] a needed areas education law enforcement et cetera et cetera\nSo how is the streetcar affecting property values in Milwaukee\nOh well I heard that's probably the price is going up right now a alone they are as a station areas\nAnd ah there is new development on the lake shore and connecting to the streetcar system as well so people are expecting a business owners and potential riders are excited about is\nOne issue that gets brought up a at times like this is the issue of gentrification the idea of ...\nLess wealthy neighborhoods renovating the area and driving out poorer residents who can't afford to live there anymore could the streetcar contribute to gentrification in Milwaukee\nIt could potentially and right now we're talking about the downtown area so um [noise] the extent of the who the gentrification property is limited but we're also talking about the expansion of the streetcar system a so potentially it could be expanded\nNorth on the Martin Luther King drive so it will go through west week at the founding a it will go through they ... a black neighborhood\nAnd it can potentially extent south from the throat ward too into walk as points\nAt walk as one it's already started to see gentrification [noise] so yes I see the concern that justification light displays current residents but ... also bring any benefits like improve the property value bring in business into this neighborhood\nUm again we need to look at gentrification from both sides\nAre let's take another call here Charlie is with us from Milwaukee Charlie good morning welcome to the morning show [noise] All right\nThank you I'm not sure what the [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah we're here go ahead\nI think we lost Charlie bad cell or you're cutting in and out to the point Charlie's point is that why would we build a system that's going to have trouble working in the wintertime when there's no\nUh we're still trying to figure out the snow plowing everything I'm that Charlie ... car in cold weather is very common and so there is going to be totally solution on that I just wish they think the buffalo last week last week\nSo they also have a light rail system um there is no\nNo issue ways operating a streetcar I'm not real include whether\nThere's a you mentioned the possible expansion of history ... wrote the streetcar system right now does it go to the new uh to the new bucks arena or and if not a is there a plan to send it there\nYes that's the discussion and uh the the they submitted grand a vacation to the federal government we haven't got the funny yet so they said they will keep try and fall future expansion as well uh we are seeking federal grants\nThe Milwaukee street car gets electricity from an overhead wire or what do urban planners have to consider when implementing this kind of infrastructure\n[noise] ah well the ... as a\nSurprise uh after the proposal was approved by ... urban planning we consider more about equity about economic development about the writer shape [noise] ah so that's all a part of the consideration\nAnd I'm also hope that they are required to eventually extended to you'd have to I'm where I work and I'm sure a lot of faculty and students and staff we allowed to ride three car down down to downtown area unexplored\nRestaurants they uh entertainment\nThat's Milwaukee say to offer us\nAnd how much does it cost to uh to ride on the ...\nRight now it's free or it's going to be free for a year and after that it's gonna be a rundown airport ride\nA dollar per ride wow that's a that sounds pretty reasonable and what people are what are you hearing what are people\nUm versus other ways of getting around town\nUh people are expecting it we're going to try it out ah and I also hear concerns like the previous caller saying like oh well it's downtown area is not happy ass leading indifferent are areas of Milwaukee\nAnd again when you think about streetcar as a small piece in a large transportation system\nAnd a gang up by you know just two miles probably it doesn't really increase people's transportation mobility are accessibility but over time last X. expended last is incorporate into their large transit system or just let them we can see its potential benefit [noise]\nI mean who thank you so much for joining us this morning appreciate your time thank you ...

P. R. dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings\nRag you turned ... is the independent candidate for governor of Wisconsin she was also an astronomer independent contractor and small business owner Maggie welcome to the show\nThank you good morning\nFirst of all why do you want to be governor of Wisconsin\nI wanted to see some variety on the ticket this year um I wanted to make sure that uh we'd have science represented I wanted to see a woman on the ticket\nI'm also um you know I kind of I could tell how the Democratic primary was going to turn out this was um this is something I could see way in advance and um I really I'm I'm actually just tired of\nThe insider network that we see represented over and over again with and these two big parties and um you know there's just so much money involved in these campaigns\nAnd I want to present something different to a different way of campaigning and connecting with people I'm not spending millions of dollars at all\nAnd um I think you know as someone who's born and raised in Wisconsin and whose whole a network is here I wanted to just give people a chance to vote for something completely different and strive to build up some middle ground in our political landscape as opposed to just\nDividing dividing and polarizing us and causing so much stress to the people who live here\nAnd we also live in a zone and a climate zone that is going through a freeze thaw every year and that's really hard on the roads we also made a decision\nI'm to not take federal funding for a train system that would've relieved a lot of pressure on our highways um so now we're stuck with all of our traffic traveling\nOn highways and I'm ... and so here we are and of ... counties are are finding themselves making tough decisions about roads and some of those some of the roads are going back to gravel [laughter]\nAnd uh we we can't just keep kicking the can down the road I mean what I Would like to see us do we are going to have to just prioritize with the resources\nWe have there's been talk about I'm going to a toll way maybe in certain areas I think we should look at that I'm very leery of it because of my own personal experience with the Illinois toll way and that would be just the worst thing ever or if we\nEnded up with a system like that in Wisconsin um but maybe there is our stretches of highway where that would be appropriate\nUm to raise revenue but um within the resources that we have there's just you know there's not a magic answer here we're just going to have to prioritize what are the highway projects that are affecting the most people and represent the most danger um it may well be that there are\nWe don't need as many miles of paved roads as we currently have in Wisconsin you know maybe that sounds crazy to people but\nUm are there areas where we could return to a permeable surface roadway and um and that would be acceptable I mean it is possible to have nice gravel roads um that's not the preference but uh we are we're gonna have to look at all options\nBut what about the gastric would you be open to raising it\nI'd be open to that um I think it makes sense you know the ones who are using the roads are should be the ones who are paving it but again\nWe don't want to we don't want to put a a burden on people who are you know they we live in a car based society we've made that decision that we're not building a train\n'em that will will relieve that pressure and allow people to get from a to be more easily without vehicles\nAnd since we're in that situation now um [noise] we know everybody has to buy gas in order to get anywhere\nSo gas tax would heavily impact everybody I'm not opposed to it necessarily because we are the users we should pay for it\nUm but if we if there is a way for us to move toward alternative transportation and revisit the idea of a train system that would not only provide a lot of jobs but relieve some of the pressure on our roadways\nI really want it I really want to pursue that\nLet's take a call the Michael ... joins us from Green Bay this morning\nI Know that as a graduate of just somehow important it is your and your tickets I Want to know what you're going forward for best picture that people want to comment invest their education you're\nRight I Am also a huge W alone I went to Madison for my undergrad and\nI'm now I'm living in Madison again and collaborating with people on campus and um I agree with you that are usually used system is a a shining light in the nation and we do have to\nProtect that um I think that the board of regents should be comprised of people who have very strong educational background working in the educational industry and who cherish the you W system though I'm like you and I do\nUm [noise] that so that's an important part of the equation I think that faculty members should be valued and I'm treated respectfully that when they get through when they jumped through all the hoops we asked them to jump through so that they can have a job security that that is there for them ten years important [noise]\nUm and in terms of you know tuition we want to keep trying to keep tuition low a word on the street is that um student loans are\nA relative to the rest of the nation you know can pretty reasonable but still you know we're talking by the time we graduate of having thirty to forty thousand dollars of of student debt so\nUm we want to make sure that people are are not getting themselves in a situation with our university where the costs of going to school then um is a major bridge burden on their lives later when they're they're trying to work and make ends meet\n[noise] which took another call of this time we'll go to Bianca in Cornell Bianca welcome to the morning show\nI think if I had and he had any\nI just wanted to follow and I've been listening on my way into work and let's say everything that you're saying sounds great I Love hearing that you've got kind of a science background um so my question comes from Canada legalization and any sort of scientific research that you've looked to chew on that kind of formulate your\nOpinion on that I Would love to hear your fans I just you know and you know even recreational\nI'm really in favor of legalizing the criminalizing um canvas for both medicinal and recreational use\nUm I've been I've researched ah a lot into cannabis the last couple of years and I like what we're seeing from the state of Washington and Oregon in Colorado where\nUm they've legalized it they regulated it's taxed it's sold through dispensaries that are very organized and\nUm you know you you can't just walk in there you go through a couple of layers of security before you're in and then you work with somebody when you're in um to learn about the products and understand exactly what you're buying\n'em but for medicinal use especially I think you know a lot of people are dealing with pain whether they're veterans or have have other chronic issues and cannabis is\nNot considered an addictive or highly addictive substance I'm In fact I'm lab experiments on on rats show that it's not you know they don't seek it out they they if they are exposed the THC in high doses\nUm they will go through withdrawal symptoms but they don't seek it out um the way they do with opioids and other um narcotics so if if we can\nAn orderly industry generate revenue through taxes and use that revenue to treat for example the opioid crisis I think that's what we need to be going after\n... you mentioned opiates and a heroin methamphetamine these all pose a significant challenge to Wisconsin at what is elected would you do to help Wisconsin nights when it comes to this issue\n[noise] yeah well I I Would very much pushed for um a rehab program that is focused on that and again you know using a ... street to help fund that I think would be an excellent way to go because it\nSimultaneously provides the revenue and I'm an alternative treatment for it that it's not effective\nWay less than two minutes left I give us your ah your elevator speech about the Foxconn deal how do you feel about that\n[noise] uh I don't you know I think is not wise for states to put so much money into one basket like that um we're we're over riding our environmental regulations for them\nWere were ... were investing billions of taxpayer dollars into this\nAnd this is an industry that is producing products that don't they're not down the line they're basically just disposable electronics you know things that are going to be obsolete within a just a few years and ended up in landfills\nAnd what if we were investing that kind of research into renewable energy and industries or solar power\nWhat if we were taking that kind of money and putting it toward a future that would imply people for a long time and create energy independence in the state of Wisconsin we could be leaders but instead we're kind of selling out to this big foreign company that's going to come in here\nAnd we don't know what we're going to get for it [laughter]\nAnd we don't we also are talking about taking jobs you know we're already at near full employment and so people who work there are going to come from other business as\nUm that it's very possible that we'll be driving local businesses out of business just by taking the the workforce away from them\nOkay mega turned both thank you for joining us this morning appreciate your time\nThank you so much enjoyed at\nBaggage rumble as the independent candidate for governor of Wisconsin she's also an astronomer independent contractor and small business owner visit Wisconsin vote dot org to hear all of our candidate interviews Wisconsin Public radio invited every statewide candidate and every one running for Congress to talk with us here on the ideas that were\nWell I think it's important because it's very symbolic I mean there's financial consequences obviously to having to pay a tax on a product that really you know use it warranted but I also I also think that is symptomatic of a\nOf an attitude toward women and ... and um and it's sort of signifies the stigma and taboo I mean it says if we're talking about providing free lipsticks two people were talking about providing something that has a basic hygiene\nItem and it's it's curious that it would be taxed but you know there are several states that have taken measures to remove that tax Minnesota and New York Illinois\nSo I think that gradually state legislatures are starting to get it that it just doesn't make sense to tax the product that people need for basic hygiene\nMarina oh should we be thinking about these products as a as a luxury [noise]\nNo absolutely not again I have to remind everyone um we don't think about paper towels or soap or toilet paper that way\nIt's just a normal hygiene products that should be available to the maximum amount of people so we can go about our business and and again I'm that's as Dan said perfectly it becomes a gender issue or barrier and part of a government workers to remove barriers so everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed\nSo marina what needs to happen in order to make your proposal a reality\n[laughter] well we're just steps away it was unanimously approved at the budget committee on Monday the full county port board will approve it hopefully\nAnd the county executive is already said publicly that he'll sign it so there's a lot of excitement and enthusiasm and it's just the beginning um we started with the two buildings to kind of provide a pilot um but it is my goal to have it is in as many buildings as possible and I do want to take a serious look at our correctional facilities um\n'cause there's a whole different type of um you know kind of issue there with a commodities and and how people are treated as so\nWe're on the way to do something big and we certainly have forced the conversation\nAnd how would the product to be paid for\nOh we're going to use our our normal um you know our normal tax levy that we pay for any services at the same way that we pay for the silk the paper towels um anything else uh the toilet paper so the same budget that that comes out of\nAnd that we supply county wide um this'll be included as a commodity I'm In that um gets a little bit closer to the equity that were seeking\nSo what do you say two men who say well why should I have to pay for this\nUm responses I've been paying for your toilet paper and so for all of that but seriously I Want to use it as a moment of learning and discussion and we want to welcome people into the discussion most men that I've talked to you about it has said wow I never realized um that\nThan station could actually not be as timely I'm as society somehow you know discussing that that you could be unprepared so a male is I'm not necessarily unprepared with soap or toilet paper those products\nBut a woman is somehow forced to fight the extensive um tampons or pads and carry them around all the time because again ... ... and uh it's a wonderful thing and the female body it's very healthy but it isn't always to the day or time so we have to carry that stuff around be nice to not have to worry about it\nOr the or could do marine or do you see this growing to include all public buildings in Milwaukee County\nThat would certainly be wonderful I've had an outpouring of support I'm editing spoken to some private facility is um yeah I think I Would like it to just be a basic thing I'm so easy in normal that we're all used to it\nUm and I think that that would really help women fry them succeed and not have to have another worry I mean we're already mothers and providers and sister and hard workers um\nWhere such an important part of our economy um and I think there's also exemplifies why it's important to have women and elected leadership um decision making places because\nI like you know I think that um had I not brought this forward I'm not sure that it would have made its way so we do need to be at the table to make sure that we're discussing is important item\nAnd do you ah do you think well Jim let me ask you what's your take on providing menstrual products in public schools\nIs there an absolute necessity [noise] um I think in most schools now if a girl goes to the school nurse she can probably get\nUm a tampon or pat 'em but that becomes sort of like a ... of a special you know she has to make request she has to you know it's not sort of like just an ordinary thing\nAnd I think having those supplies rate in the bathroom just makes everything less stigmatized and easier for her so she can just go on about her day I think it's a really fundamental things that you know whether it's county buildings or public schools or private businesses\nThis is the beginning of a really a shift in attitudes about not only about ... about women\nAnd large public facility is you know half their customers typically are women and and if you start thinking about is this good customer service to inconvenience women or to or to make their experience in your facility\nOh one that is equal to men are treated but I I think someone had to be first and I think I think marina took this step and is bringing you know I'm lucky county governments as significant entity right\nAt the their example is going to help the public school and say yeah this really has the right thing to do in the city of Milwaukee and maybe we have the marquee brewers are the box and you you know we we start to change the the attitude toward\nTo women and men streets and and it would be a terrific thing\nA marina Dimitri ... serves on the Milwaukee County board of supervisors recent proposal would require menstrual

once housed big box retailers like toys are us we're Circuit City dealer how long of Halloween pop up shop spin around [noise]\nSo the first one was opened by the man who eventually open Spencers Ninety three I actually originally owned a women's clothing store and decided to toss in like that man ... for the fake blood\nA and he had a huge success with that in the early eighties and started operating a few more pop ups or it's a but they didn't really become popular and have a lot of other competitive chains until the mid to late nineties\nSo there are actual chains of these pop up shops what are some of the main ones\nSpirit Halloween is by far the biggest uh this year they're actually even more than Thirteen hundred and twenty five spirit stores in the U.S and they have a seasonal workforce at about twenty thousand people which is pretty impressive since that's actually for the time being a larger and larger than say the number of JC Penney's and the U.S\nThank you John it's nice to be here\n[noise] tell us about the Milwaukee Streetcar what does this record a car looked like what kind of vehicle is this and how does it run\n'em aids on aid to end the mouse stretch and ... now has two routes ... around in the downtown area and how that's most bird to authentic frowned\nAnd you can think of that chain as a third I think that's a very loud and check and it's a environment for them building it has to hop symbol on the cars that it's gonna be interesting to read it\nAnd it runs on electricity over tracks\nYes or a rise out and actually stay over to track\nIt people in Wisconsin may still be familiar with street cars those who are old enough and I guess I Would have to count myself as one of those others may have encountered trolley use\nAh in in some cities what's the difference between a what do we think of history cars or trolleys and what the uh the hop is in Milwaukee\nI think technology wise there is no much difference and it runs on the fix track it has a very small space in between the stops sit you hop on hop off going to different destinations very easily\nUm to my understanding is just to name which on a street car that basically means technology life the same thing oh of course we have when you are clean our technology flush right now\nAnd but this isn't a this isn't my grandfather's a streetcar they were bumpy and noisy and uncomfortable would tell us about these modern street cars what are they like inside\nA it's gonna be\nAlready smooth I haven't tried out and I'm going to try out our hub this coming weekend but when I ride on the street cars across the country or they are very comfortable and you can see the streets gaping you can see people walking by it's going to be very pleasant\nAnd how many people can run on these at one time\nA few hundred but we are like us transportation professional as we are talking about in the late ... shape and the expected to ride shape it's around the thousand a day\nSo now that we understand what it looks like and how it works let's talk about the primary purpose of the Milwaukee Streetcar why does it exist\nOh well we've been talking about streetcar all a real transit system for a long time [noise] uh\nSo the phone there and actually the federal funding came to Milwaukee in Nineteen Ninety One so when the Ice T the multiple year federal funding but our law was passed during that time and the law was to encourage multi mode though a safe\nTransportation system for all people so alone with either the larger metropolitan areas like Los Angeles like the sea Milwaukee also get a big chunk of federal funds to support a expensive\nTransit system in Milwaukee but over it at the time the said they didn't have the matching phones\nAnd a day discussion of a real it's real transit system has been going on for years until ten to Fifteen so that was when uh the time that the common cause of Milwaukee approved the current scope off the street car that's the streetcar we see today with a two and half a mile stretch\nShow is part of the ... is part of the reason for this thing to exist to attract a tourism or to get people to come to downtown Milwaukee something else uh what what uh what's the goal here\nUh I guess now go the larger goal as economic development so the goal is slightly different from\nThirty almost Thirty years ago at that time we were talking about transportation support transportation access to\nJobs to opportunities right now I think the goal is more um um improve the image of Milwaukee and serving right now which they um they tried half mile distance serving the downtown business ...\nResidents and for sure ah tourists and visitors to downtown ... enjoy the convenience rides a the coming into service provider provided by the streetcar [noise]\nShoe for listeners who aren't in Milwaukee give us some background this has been on the word since the early nineties and uh what finally a tip the scales and made this thing a reality\n[noise] I think as they perception and acceptance of transit service is a full year's a there is a perception um transit and there is a perception that\nReal transit is going to be super expensive or they can be costly for the residents and they serve\nHigher income people uh those people leaving in downtown and connecting to the suburbs I'm over the years we realized that we cannot rely on private automobiles\nAre the streets are getting congested the air quality is getting a worse than was the emission from the cars so residents in Milwaukee it seems to me are more and more acceptable to a environmental frankly convenient to change its services\nAnd we know that transit is not as a way I'm\nAs a way a perceived as slow as efficient and transit is more convenient and serving\nHave learned come in the service is or access to a lot of different opportunities\nSo I think Milwaukee residents are accepting a new mode of a new phase of transit I just wanted to bring up like in addition to the streetcar Milwaukee is also seeking grants to build the first bus rapid transit system in Milwaukee so we're talking about a lot of different modes of transit now\nI mean who is chair of the department and a professor at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee school of architecture and urban planning we're talking about the new Milwaukee's streetcar the hop\nOr you can hop on the ... there's a starting this Friday they're opening it up to the public and you can check that out if you were in Milwaukee\nOf the uh the the streetcar in Milwaukee moves on city streets the official website details that goes between twenty five and thirty miles per hour in stops every three to four blocks what are some safety concerns people raised with a streetcar sharing the street with buses and cars\n[noise] ah we've seen some small accidents already the main reason is that people haven't got used to\nBig trading on the street as it's mixed traffic [noise]\nUm I guess the only thing we can do is just be aware of street car just imagine just know that it's a big trading or the magic is a big check\nDo not stop suddenly in front of the the ... do not turn right in front of the train those are the things that were like when you can see that one way or where there is a big chain a reading next to us\nAnd what about ah people up at ... or bicycle is a horror officials making sure that they aren't are in danger\n[noise] ah there are a lot of new ... new a ... a new designs a features to make sure that people are aware that the trend is coming and ... can cross the street to simulate a watching out for the ...\nAnd frankly when people get used to the streetcar and when people get used to the mix traffic it's gonna be potential they it's going to be safer if I'll be best friends and bicyclists if the streetcar can reduce automobile traffic on the streets [noise]\nUm we've seen we've seen a lot of a successful examples across the country when the streets are more open to translate 'em reduce the traffic of private automobile is that encourage people walking biking on the street that's going to increase the safety\nAnd speaking of bicycles some a bicycle riders aren't happy with the trolley or what the what the streetcar because their tires have gotten wedge during the streetcar tracks that we've seen other complaints already\nYeah we've seen complains about bicyclists got [laughter] or tires and attract um and people are also worried about uh how to get a their bikes on off the train but that's going to be sorted out very easily\nAnd up the bicycle is probably can also say that if they're really worried about their tires they consider alternative paper routes or so is that up using um the streets to waste the three ... track they can go to the next block\nAnd we also have I'm Sorry we also have a they buy tracks are around us station areas and helping to helping people to transfer from bicycle into the new streetcar\nProfessor either who stays with us talking about the Milwaukee streets are what do you think about the street cars is the hop a good investment or or not\nOr what do you think about the areas that it covers do you think it's too small an area or is it just right are you excited derive the uh the hop in Milwaukee what makes you want to experience this unit\nOr maybe you plan to stay as far away from it as you can well either way\nTell us why maybe you live in a community that has a streetcar what are the advantages are seeing what are the challenges you encounter\nYou can hop on the radio with us it eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas of WNPR dot org has the email address and you can tweet us at WNPR morning It's MORNING show on the ideas that worked on John months with [noise]\nI see the point and I understand the concern um first a large part of the founding of including the capital cause as we were seeing a close to a hundred million dollars ... now\nAnd a large part of the operating costs although it's through point if I mean every year they most of them are provided are funded by the federal government's so we got the funding to do that\nUm and it's a small part of the uh capital costs and the operating costs will come from the fair and will come from they have a tax incremental financing a let's say some in the city of Milwaukee the expectation is that\nThe streetcar can improve the property value and it can increase the attractiveness of the downtown [noise] a lot of people going to enjoy urban life and streetcar conflict actually provide\nThat atmosphere that amenities for people to see Milwaukee CD as a revived as a very lively say they are in that sense a again a streetcar as a tool tool um improve the economy\nAnd potentially bring a lot of tax dollars money into the day which can be used\nSupport for WPRI comes from you W credit union providing financial consultant who are dedicated to helping members plan for retirement with options like IRAs more at you WC you dot org your best interest always comes first\nYes and a ... there is new development on the lake shore and connecting to the streetcar system as well so people are expecting a business owners and potential riders are excited about these\nOne issue that gets brought up though at times like this is the issue of gentrification the idea of wealthier people moving into less wealthy neighborhoods renovating the area and driving out poorer residents who can't afford to live there anymore could the streetcar contribute to gentrification in Milwaukee\nIt could potentially and right now we're talking about the downtown area so um [noise] the extent of the who the gentrification property is limited but we're also talking about the expansion of the streetcar say some are so potentially it could be expanded\nNorth on the Martin Luther King drive so it will go through west week at the funding or it will go through a day and I said a black neighborhood\nAnd it can potentially extent south from the throat ward too into ... points\nAt walk as one it's already started to see gentrification so yes I see the concern that justification my displays\nCurrent residents but ... also bring Amy Bennett face like improve the property value brain in business into this neighborhood um again we need to look at gentrification from both sides\nAre let's take another call here Charlie is with us from Milwaukee Charlie good morning welcome to the morning show [noise] All right\nThank you I'm\nSure is one of the [noise] [noise]\nYeah we're here go ahead\nI think we lost Charlie bad cell you're cutting in and out to the point Charlie's point is that why would we build a system that's going to have trouble working in the wintertime when there's no\nUh we're still trying to figure out the snow plowing everything [noise] um that Charlie us just car in cold weather is very common and so there is going to
