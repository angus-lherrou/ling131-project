Atkins Rosen faculty fellow at New York university's stern school of business he wrote the book the sharing economy the end of employment and the rise of crowd based capitalism ruined welcome to the morning show\nA John delighted to be [noise]\nYou've written a lot about the sharing economy at first it tell us exactly what that term means when you say sharing the economy what do you mean\nThough I mean talking about a family of changes that are reorganizing how we sort of deliver the goods and services and the economy\nUm instead of the company's hiring people full time I'm offered thing offering that instead of a stable job and benefits and you know the company is delivering the goods and services to people\nWe instead of moving into an economy Web platforms are\nAggregating demand from consumers and then connecting to sort of these distributed an independent workers\nActually supplement that with some sort of consulting or freelance work okay look on the site and so these platforms definitely present an opportunity to you know sort of ... and the water and see if this kind of work is good for you and also some skills running your own business being a micro on to ...\nAnother interesting thing that I think the study highlight is that\nUm the volume of work done on these platforms seems to be growing [noise] um but the number of ... ... per week that the average worker is working unfair platform like ... seems to have dropped quite significantly [noise]\nUm and so while more and more Americans are you know dabbling in the gig economy it seems that increasingly against in the short trodden [noise] they're not doing it as their primary income so us but they using it as a secondary income so us\nAnd the uh uh what about the hourly wages that people make doing things like driving for Uber or Lyft or how does that compare to what they might make if they had what we might call on a regular job\n[noise] well um you know if you compare it it it it depends on I guess which city you're talking about and what you're comparing it to\n'em if you compare how much lift and who but drivers make ... an hour after all expenses I'm In New York city I'm dead doing slightly better than yellow taxi drivers used to do a few years ago I'm doing the same kind of work and they have more flexibility [noise]\nUm but the ... to the level of you know earnings put a ... not very high um at some and you know in the ... we're gonna have to do some things over the next few years to make sure that the push them up sort of beyond the Fifteen to twenty dollar range\nYes the study found that over the last five years monthly earnings across the gig economy have gone down and you mentioned that I um [noise]\nAh it also shows that most people did not use or one of these platforms for more than a quarter of the year uh how does that factor into for example are falling unemployment rates\nWell I'm you know I think the\nYou know is very strong um but I think what the unemployment numbers don't pick is that while the fraction of the workforce that is unemployed is all over the last thirty of the buildings of people especially at a soda the mid range income level of the job market\nHave been stagnant as being the hollowing out the middle class and so an increasing number of people are going to these online platforms to try and supplement their income mode of choosing sort of a second job part time job to try and sort of bring up their income\nAnd I think the numbers in the study um bear that out because they're showing that more people apart dissipating\nBut you know the fact that they're earning less per month on average with that they're doing it only at a particular time of the Israeli signature of it being part time work to supplement your main income\nOr occasionally we'll look at a particular point in the way you feel your expenses are high and you need to generate some extra cash\nAll right well I Know well you have to leave us a this seems like a good place as any to end the conversation or a ... a thank you so much for spending this time with this this morning I really appreciate it\nAll right well thank

thank you thank you so much a ruined singer Roger ... is professor of in the Robert Ellen de Alaskans Rosen faculty fellow at New York university's ... school of business he wrote the book the sharing economy the unemployment and the rise of crowd based capitalism\nAnd just a minute we'll be looking at why forty percent of Wisconsin students scored as proficient or higher and reading math and science assessment test but first\nRepublicans in Wisconsin's first congressional district are fighting hard to hold onto the seat house Speaker Paul Ryan has held for nearly two decades as Laurel right were white reports of former Ryan staffers facing off in the race against the Democrat who's hoping to harness party enthusiasm to flip the seat\nLast year millions of dollars started falling into Wisconsin from all over the country with one purpose defeat Paul Ryan and twenty Eighteen the money mostly went to a Democrat Randy price and iron worker and union activists who had run and lost previous elections for state and local offices\nThat price clean really struck a chord this time with his campaign announcement video released in June twenty seven\nBraces ad went viral he got millions of dollars out of state campaign contributions and the endorsement and Senator Bernie Sanders who won Wisconsin democratic presidential primary in twenty six teams that almost a year later the narrative changed when Paul Ryan dropped out of their race\nOr what I realize is if I'm here for one more term my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend at a I just can't let that happen\nRepublicans chose Brian style an attorney and member of the University of Wisconsin board of regents as their party's nominee for the seat in early campaign ad style introduced himself as a conservative outsider who could bring Wisconsin style politics to Washington\nBecause I was raised right here in Janesville southeast Wisconsin values I don't care much for Washington style politics\nStyles first campaign for office but he's hardly a newcomer to geopolitics he was once a staffer for Ryan and with a delicate at the Republican National convention in twenty sixteen style and his allies who tried to frame the race around prices background Republican groups have run ads pointing out that\nFor crimes including drunk driving and property damage Joseph tacky as a democratic strategist who's worked on a number of campaign in Wisconsin He says Bryson's responded well to do is a tax\nShe's put it out there that this is wire take it or leave it you know what we've got enough people with Ivy League credentials and who have never gotten in trouble in their whole life and Congress and look where it's got\nNot everyone agrees Randy Bryce his own brother James price supports style and even cut a TV ad on his behalf mark ... Republican strategist who's worked on statewide campaigns he acknowledges Republicans are facing headwinds in the twenty Eighteen election but says style has run a strong race and a GOP district\nI mean I think he fits the district well his background in manufacturing I think is a real positive right now I think his work I'm In the community with his family is something that is also a real positive and I think a big contrast with Randy Bryce\nBryce is trying to dry his own contrast comparing sales work as a corporate attorney to his own blue collar background\nBut it's not about who's the more perfect person to represent your photo understands the hardships that you're going to face in order to make your world a better place\nWhen it comes to issues the to follow partisan divide seen elsewhere this election cycle price supports Medicare for all and the Affordable CARE Act protections for people with preexisting conditions style says more price transparency and increased use of health savings accounts would make the healthcare system better\nThe race doesn't have the national profile it once did that millions of dollars are still being spent here as style fights to hold onto a GOP district and Bryce tries to harness democratic enthusiasm to flip it moral\nLight is constant public radio\n\nComing up on the morning show in the twenties Seventeen twenty Eighteen school year roughly forty percent of Wisconsin students scored as proficient or higher on reading math and science assessment test and that number hasn't changed much\nIn the past few years and just a few moments we'll take a look at what those numbers mean and what this looks like from the point of view of a teacher but first\nDo you are out of town fringe chuckle when you talk because you're just so Wisconsin\nUh-huh I can hear it now tomorrow on the morning show we're going to learn about that Wisconsin accent and we want to hear from you\nHere's a we dug you to do color voice mail and just say

scrawny\nJust dial eight three three four to four three three to seven eight three three four to four three three to seven or eight three three forty two ideas and let us hear you speak some Scotty I think this is going to be fun [noise]\nIt's a morning show on the ideas that work at Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nImprove our daughter's skills so\nThere's a significant change in their methods and the availability to teachers to actually deliver those skills\nAs there's a lot of distractions from other students in the class which are taking a significant amount of time away from actually skilled development and we're just finding it very difficult to see if we allow the penetration of these skills in the schools\nKevin thanks for your call Scott cursed yes I'm right here did you hear Kevin ...\nYes I did and and actually that\nThat is an issue um when we talk about a lot of these things we always what I hear in the news is the idea of an achievement gap where it's really truly an opportunity gap that we're not allowing her students the opportunities to learn as as\nEveryone um a lot of the students are coming in with issues with things that are coming outside they're not being fed they're not being um help that they're they're they're coming in with with more issues and and if we were to just have them\nUm you know come in and we can just teach them these these standards are great um the methods that the teachers all the scouts in our ... but we have a lot of things that we have to work on with the students in addition to just teaching the math or just teaching them literacy\nWhat about Kevin's point that the there were so many distractions in the classroom that the uh the teachers were are seem to be prevented from really doing what needs to be done to ah to help students learn how to read or do math or whatever it is they're working on [noise]\nWell I'm not a sociologist um but I ... you can talk a lot of teachers a lot of a lot of people in the educational system that that really are stating now that there are lot more things that children have to deal with nowadays um that there's a lot of um tension in families\nThere's a lot of tension in the social structures with social media with all these other distractions that are coming out um we have to really\nUs um [noise] it it it used to be that\nUm we never heard about this stuff but now we are and so his teacher if we're really passionate about trying to get these students to a level where their brains are are are able to take him this this intellectual material and they're not worried about will I be able to eat this weekend\nOr you know what's going to happen in my way to school\nAnd every teacher cares about that every teacher has a passion\nUm we get to know each and every student\nAnd sometimes it really it really hurts us going home and knowing that they're not having the structures that they need to learn that equipment\nWe have a caller from ladies Smith a next to let's go to a bar and yes bar good morning thanks for joining us\nGet morning one of the things that I wanted to point out that banned testing coordinator in our district said last Twenty years and that's it you said that the testing score is where flat at the last\nThree years and years ago we switched to a different path and all that the only one factor I don't think he can be ignored that it tests that we're using now is not exactly\nIt doesn't pass this didn't in the way that they used to have that they're being educated and sell it a lot difficult until everyone scores went down three years ago\nFarm thanks for sharing that inside Scott ...\n... ... that's exactly that's exactly the point on so many individuals want this to be a switch but because\nOf the curriculum builds off each other and when you change the test you're changing the things that you're actually evaluating we need to build the scaffolding ideas between the students from kindergarten the first second or third this is not something we're going to see a huge change from year to year but we're going to see that increase so it is difficult when\nWhen things change because people are saying it's not working fast enough this is not a ... is it not something that can be done in six months a year despite take decades\nState education officials pointed out that there's been a slight improvement in uh in math scores of forty one point one percent of students proficient or better in math up from forty point three percent in twenty Fifteen\nOh that sounds like a ... you know increase but is it actually small or is this statistically significant\nSuch a great point on a lot of times we we don't have a lot of that data given to us just says here's your number\nOr what the schools do go to school to get those numbers are able to look at it she the students that actually increase see if any decreased\nWhat are the issues and then the schools used that number I'm the schools used the subsets of all those numbers to help direct individual students in classrooms as far AS number going up and down it really is not\nMeaningful for any school district um sometimes it is for the um individuals in public who like saying my school district is a forty and you're supposed to thirty nine that's better well not really you know what what what we do we use this data and all the ... the state of to help guide how can we\nEducate each individual students better every year\nAnd what do we mean by proficient\n[laughter] well that's that's a great question a lot of people like saying oh advanced as a profession is be and so and so forth that's not what we're talking about what proficient means is that if you were given a certain tasks there are certain performance standard\nThey're able to demonstrate a ... a large portion of it or all of it um in in some sort of artifacts and some sort of assessments federal proficient meat and\nThat's what we're aiming for that everyone meets this the standards are written developmental so that we can say at a given grade level this is what an average students should be able to comprehend developmentally which means that they're going to be some students\nBelow if we had former standards where everyone was ... percent um we'd be questions on it honestly all these assessments would be a question that everyone is making so we're getting away from 'em comparing ourselves to others to this is where you should be if you're not really help you off\nScot curses an assistant professor of education at Saint Norbert college into pure we're

S. um really\nBelieve that a political warming is happening and that's partly because they can see it in their own backyards I'm In that job and they can see it in terms of the street and then\nUm well I think there is more typical human about all the solutions and what the solution slip cost so I think we need to separate the debate about whether bombing and pocketing which is pretty much settled although there are people who\nDo still failed skeptical about science we need to separate that discussion\nFrom the ... about whether we should do something about it on this\nUh there are going to be some impacts to the economy from rising temperatures according to the study of the United states could lose roughly one point two percent of gross domestic product for every one point eight degrees of warming\nUh yes um the will be um economic impacts and\nWe can see even though we can't show that something like um ten is directly fingerprinted warming at the moment if you look at\nThe impacts of severe storms or whether it be and Florida or New York or Texas um those give us some indication off the source of losses that we can experience I'm more extreme a climate\nUm but then there are a lot of things that I'm a law says that it's challenging to put a dollar figure on so how'd you actually\nUm put a cost or or put a price on the loss of color week\nAll the fact that the types of but you see I'm In ah northern Wisconsin might be changing up people have a connection a cultural connection to that local ecosystem and they may feel a sense of loss if that changes\nThat really is quite difficult to put specific dollar amount on so\nWe can definitely estimates some of the economic damages bought the ... of the law says that a positive to put a dollar value on\nWhat the ah the report a estimate it has a a figure for estimated damage from climate related events at somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty four trillion dollars is that a worldwide number\nYes that's calculated to a wild wide um and it doesn't include some of these um what you might say call those intangibles all a values the on in in the economy at the moment\nDo we have a way to compare that to what it would cost us to implement a policy changes we would need in order to prevent this from happening\nYeah yeah so we do know that in the report although one of the things to keep in mind is the way that I teach the bucks as we go to rich and over such what we're trying to do is synthesize all the science that said and done since the last report and\nI'm One of the limitations in the economic costs things is\nActually haven't seen many studies done on although it's interesting that of course Nobel Prize for economics\nThis meat when two I'm Still not house who's uh the person who developed the original economic costing for climate change 'em\nBut in terms of the cost of a ploy eating those losses or avoiding those damages um the the main estimate that we make is the investment that would be needed in the energy systems to transition from a system that and it's a lot of carbon dioxide\nTo one the admits lot less and that's\nI'm In the order several trillion dollars yet we we we're not trying to hide that this will cost responding to global warming and\nThe estimate is that it might require up to two percent of global GDP so there is a there is an expense but we have to balance that against the costs of warming and also that\nUm blooming insult people's lives in Los\n... as I said an ecosystem saying last so how do we balance those those two I think um\nWe we have some callers who want to share what they are doing personally to try to reduce their carbon footprint Chris in Port wing we'll go to you first Chris good morning\nMorning thanks for this very important show this is a very uh uh important and and somewhat frightening study I I wanted to point out that you know for over Thirty years up here in northern Wisconsin we've been able to use solar and wind power for all of our electricity in\nOur residents and our business we have a building that hates self year round up by port wing justice solar energy we've driven cars for the last Thirty years that get more than forty miles to the gallon in right now it's pretty easy to find a credit ... gets fifty miles a gallon\nAnd we've been vegetarian for over forty years\nThere's a lot of different alternatives and if people want to get past\nThe the the down frightened side and get into the solutions there's a great book out there called drawdown it's the most comprehensive plan to propose to reverse global warming was edited by Paul hawk and then put out a couple of years ago and there are hundreds solutions\nTo not just stop emitting carbon and other greenhouse gases but to actually draw out the carbon from the environment's so there's some very surprising things I'm number four on their rated from one to a hundred for the most effective\nNumber four is eating up plant rich diet which I kind of just mentioned vegetarianism but you don't have to be a vegetarian you can just eat more plants in less meat\nUm and it will ever get we're getting real close to new Simon I Want to take another call here but thank you for that and we'll get our guest response Carolyn from Madison your next very quickly [noise]\nYeah ... trees and shrubs and especially those that um feed you you know that they're not thinking ... a lawn\nInstead of lawns and then you don't have to mow them either so that would be a that would be another a benefit although we'd have to find some other way to exercise Carolyn thanks for that Chris thanks for your call uh we'll get ... response to those two calls a after\nThe news what are you ah what would what do you propose to do a you have anything to reduce your carbon footprint eight hundred six four to one two three four and we're talking about a recent report from the United nations agency that just says we're in big trouble if we don't get a handle on ah\nOn global warming before twenty forty that's kind of our deadline here Diana ... is with us and you can be to this is the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio\nSo they're all um and if you slept coastal cities um because you've gone too high a warming um it would be it's very difficult to get the city's back especially at that cities that have\nUm cakes like cultural heritage that um we would want to protect\nLet's take some more calls a lot of people want to join the discussion we'll see how many we can get through here mark in Appleton we will start with you marketed morning\nOr courting um what's on a reporter is really a matter of finding time bomb in in the Arctic or a\n... I think you're I think we are you you're in a bad cell I let me have the guest address the methane issue we'll see if we can get you on a different a better line a march concerned about under reporting of the what he called the methane time bomb in the Arctic go can you talk about that pleases Diana ...\nYes um we don't discuss that in great detail in the summer if a policy has it changed the but the part of the report that's been receiving attention but then the full report um we do talk about the issue of a methane and the way in which I'm a\nWarmer temperatures um they ... around in the Arctic could melt\nAnd that frozen ground actually contains a lot of praise the nice thing so if you do get about one point five or two degrees you can trigger the release of that methane and that methane adds\nTo the global warming effect so you get a a sort of an acceleration you've got to the fact that they still eat them all in the temperate chest so the caller raises a very important issues that we do talk about that in the report but we're not exactly show when that happens and\nThey all that would lead to the acceleration\nLet's take another call we'll go to Milwaukee next where a NATO or wants to join us Nate good morning\nAll right thank you very much I Would say that she wanted to look at an impact global warming a recently with the past couple of months we have more intense rainstorm some flooding that wasn't listen I'm\nA staff summer and I seen global warming are causing economic impacts wherever you've got things like out of control wildfires is California head and you sort of mine are causing a lot of damage we're still\nPaying for health and useful recover and wants things I really think that we have a leg to deal with is the amount of ... lying that's been going on and we got a silk or schools about people trying to the guy global warming because frankly I since they got paid to a five to ...\nLet somebody else a clean up the ... or ... years taxpayers are going to end up paying for this overall on one place the earlier caller mentioned the\nPlaces to look I Would say she was all it's not our own back yard a national snow and ice data center has some interesting a history of over Thirty years records for a Arctic Sea ice ... and you can just\nHunker icy every year to go down okay ... thanks thanks for joining the conversation a Dana libertarian mates uh talking about we're already seeing local impacts are here in Wisconsin\nExcellent point and I thought I was listening to your\nWeather forecasts than than is I was thinking about the full cost of flooding and Wisconsin and the hurricane and Florida and what we talked about in the book is the ... ah make the absolute link that um that\nFlooding or storms ah on such short global warming the point we make is that global warming could mathematically\nIncreases the chances of flooding on the ... says the power and so\nUm we will get more extreme events as things get Wilma\n... is the uh the the big uh the elephant in the room if you will do is the political challenge of getting a the necessary steps taken how do you uh how did the politics of the United states and other world powers effect progress on climate change\nWell in general I'm hardly any country has a made the\nCommitment to ... hops ... at the rate and amount that we recommend to end the pool if he won't say I'm the one point five degrees costs to be a lot of the country's top committed to on the top neutral\n[noise] but most of the countries have made commitments to Jason mission\nBut not enough that the Paris Agreement that was made a few years ago yes countries agreed to get you seven missions thought we estimated what that commitment with results and and it still results in more than three degrees centigrade on which you know is seven degrees Fahrenheit so\nI'm On the wealthy countries need to do more including the United states\nWithin the United states I think the um the state that has done the most to be in line with\nThe pop place we look at in the court is California that has made a commitment to um net net neutral pop and um I was at the time period that we're talking about and has a hunter ... side of\nIt can be done in this country um it does cost something um thought we were starting to see that it could be possible\nA bomb I Wish we had another whole hour to talk about this or how optimistic are you about what happens next\nThat severely challenging question it depends on that day I mean\nBoth have report shows is that it's possible to say I'm the one point five\nThought it requires a dramatic times the nations that I really wonder if like I Need to be able to cut emissions by\nFalse um so I Would say that I'm optimistic that we could have a ... but we would have to go to the shade so part of my focus 'em out to be such a is thinking about\nHow to adapt to this bombing that took us\nShould be able to transition of why I like the more

morning show\nJohn delighted to be [noise]\nYou've written a lot about the sharing economy at first to tell us exactly what that term means when you say sharing economy what do you mean\nAre we talking about a family of changes\nThat are reorganizing how we set of deliver the goods and services and the economy um instead of the company's hiring people full time\nI'm all for anything offering that instead of a stable job and benefits and you know the company's delivering the goods and services to people we instead of moving into an economy Web platforms are\nAggregating demand from ... and then connecting to sort of these distributed and independent workers\nActually supplement it with some sort of consulting or freelance will go gig look on the site and so these platforms definitely present an opportunity to you know sort of ... and the water and see if this kind of work is good for you and also build some skills running your own business being a microwave to pronounce\nAnother interesting thing that I think the study highlights says that\nUm the volume of work done on these platforms seems to be growing [noise] um but the number of ... ... per week that the average worker is working on say a platform like ... seems to have dropped quite significantly [noise]\nUm and so while more and more Americans are you know dabbling in the gig economy it seems that increasingly at least in the short trodden [noise] they're not doing it as their primary income so us but they're using it as a secondary income so us [noise]\nAnd uh the uh uh what about the hourly wages that people may doing things like driving for Uber or Lyft or how does that compare to what they might make if they had what we might call her a regular job\nWell um you know if you compare it it it it depends on I guess which city are talking about and what you're comparing it to\n'em if you compare how much lift and who voted drivers make put our after all expenses I'm In New York city um they're doing slightly better than yellow taxi drivers used to do a few years ago I'm doing the same kind of work and they have more flexibility [noise]\nUm but the ... to a level of you know a ... put ... not very high\nKnow in the ... we're going to have to do some things over the next few years to make sure that people push them up sort of be on the Fifteen to twenty dollar range\nHere says study found that over the last five years monthly earnings across the gig economy have gone down you mentioned that I um [noise]\nAh it also shows that most people did not use a one of these platforms for more than a quarter of the year uh how does that factor into for example are falling unemployment rates\n[noise] well um you know they I think the you know the full time job market you know is very strong\nUm but I think what the unemployment numbers ... is that while the fraction of the workforce that is unemployed is that a little over the last thirty of the buildings of people especially in the mid range income level of the job market\nHave been stagnant as being the hollowing out to the middle class\nAnd so an increasing number of people are going to be is online platforms to try and supplement that end up choosing sort of a second job part time job to try and sort of bring up their income\nAnd I think the numbers in the study um bear that out because they're showing that more people are

and the twenty Seventeen twenty Eighteen school year roughly forty percent of Wisconsin students scored as proficient or higher on reading math and science assessment test and that number hasn't changed much\nIn the past few years and just a few moments we'll take a look at what those numbers mean and what this looks like from the point of view of a teacher but first\nDo you are out of town

ideas\nAnd let us hear you speak some Scotty I think this is going to be fun\nOn the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nAs there's a lot of distractions from other students in the class which are taking a significant amount of time away from actually skilled development and we're just finding it very difficult to see if we allow the penetration of these skills in the schools\nKevin thanks for your call Scott cursed\nYes from right here\nDid you hear Kevin ...\nYes I did and and actually that that is an issue um when we talk about a lot of the things we always what I hear in the news is the idea of an achievement gap where it's really truly an opportunity gap that we're not allowing our students the opportunities to learn as as\nEveryone um a lot of the students are coming in with issues with things that are coming outside they're not being fed\nThey're not being held for they're they're they're coming in with with more issues and and if we were to just have them um you know come in and we can just teach them these these standards are great um the methods that the teachers in Wisconsin are ...\nBut we have a lot of things that we have to work on with the students in addition to just teaching math or just teaching them literacy\nWhat about Kevin's point that the there were so many distractions\n... are seem to be prevented from really doing what needs to be done to ah to help students learn how to read or do math or whatever it is they're working on [noise]\nWell I'm not a sociologist\nUm but I I uh you can talk to a lot of teachers a lot of a lot of people

of tension in the social structures with social media with\nAll these other distractions that are coming out um we have to really change the out the ways that we are approaching us um [noise] it it it

...\nWe have a caller from lady Smith a next to let's go to a bar and yes bar good morning thanks for joining us\nGet morning one of the things that I wanted to point out that banned testing coordinator in our district the last Twenty years and that's it you said that the testing score is where flat at the last three years three years ago we switched to a different path and all that the only one factor I don't think he can be annoying that\nIt tests that we're using now is not exactly it doesn't pass this didn't in a way that they used to ah that they're being educated and sell it a lot difficult until everyone went down three years ago\nFarm thanks for sharing that inside Scott curse\nHe actually that's exactly that's exactly the point on so many individuals want this to be a switch\nBut because the curriculum builds off each other and when you change the test you're changing the things that you're actually evaluating we need to build the scaffolding ideas between the students from kindergarten the first second or third this is not something we're going to see a huge change from year to year but we are going to see that increase so it is difficult\nWhen when things change because people are saying it's not working fast enough this is not a ... is it not something that can be done in six months a year despite take decades\nState education officials pointed out that there's been a slight improvement in ah in math scores of forty one point one percent of students proficient or better in math up from forty point three percent in twenty Fifteen\nOh that sounds like a ... you know increase but is it actually small or is this statistically significant\nSuch a great point on a lot of times we we don't have a lot of that data given was just those here's your number of what the schools to go to school to get those numbers are able to look at it she the students that actually increase the if any decreased\nWhat are the issues and then the schools used that number I'm In the schools used the subsets of all those numbers to help direct individual students in classrooms as far AS number going up and down it really is not\nMeaningful for any school district um sometimes it is for the um individuals in public who like saying my school district is a forty and yours is a thirty nine that's better but not really you know what what what we do we use this data and all the ... the state of to help guide how can we\nEducate each individual students better every year\nAnd what do we mean by proficient\n[laughter] well that's that's a great question a lot of people\nAnd so so far that's not what we're talking about what proficient means is that if you were given a certain tasks there are certain performance standard they are able to demonstrate\nA ... a large portion of it or all of it um in in some sort of artifacts of some sort of assessments federal proficient me that's what we're aiming for that everyone meets\nThe standards are written develop meant so that we can stay at a given grade level this is what an average students should be able to comprehend developmentally\nWhich means that they're to me some students that are above and obviously some students who are below if we had former standards where everyone was well hundred percent um\nWe'd be questions or that's honestly all these assessments would be a question that everyone is making so we're getting away from 'em comparing ourselves to others to this is where you should be if you're not really help you off\nScot curses an assistant professor of education at Saint Norbert college into pure we're talking about the uh the the results released this past week from the most recent round of standardized tests given to students in Wisconsin\nAre you a parent or
