Wisconsin Public Radio's reporter in superior and host of the regional program here me out Danny good morning thanks for joining us\nGood learning John\nSo first of all let's talk about what's behind this rate increase a request from superior water light in power\nYeah they have their requesting this rate increase for a number of reasons um one that they say is the most important is because they're making major improvements to upgrade their system are carrying a lot of water mains and lines in the city and there are also doing work at their water treatment plant\nAnd they're repairing and electric grid or out of a electric station I'm In the city and so that's one reason that they're saying that this is important that they need to raise rates right now I'm another part of that\nThat might be arrested for nonviolent\nOffense but its drug related they could refer them instead of booking them into jail they could refer them to treatment or if they come into contact with someone on a welfare check and they know that you know they're dealing with an addiction they could offer to get this person help 'em um\nAnd that's all aimed at reducing recidivism\nShow who would who would be the the fence must be non violent of who else is that the only criteria for eligibility what else\n[noise] well yeah the offense would have to be non violent so you know if someone were to commit a crime when they were high on drugs and they were hurting someone that would obviously probably not be a candidate to take part in this pilot program\nI'm usually it's the people who are can betting property crimes like they're stealing shoplifting to support their habit those are the type of people that um agencies come in contact with\nUm that would be a old to take advantage of treatment rather than being put in jail or because of this thing a drug use\nIs there a sense of how many people of these three communities my hope to serve\n[noise]\nI don't think so at this time I think you know it's fairly new I think they're hoping that they'll serve I'm also a lot of people so that they can keep them from using other\nA taxpayer dollar you know as far as the amount of overcrowding in that they see in the jails here that's been an issue in here and elsewhere in northern Wisconsin\nI'm I Know that it will be available to residents of Douglas County even though it is if you're a police department that receive the grant and it will be the same in 'em sock county even though the son Craig police department or the background they're hoping to reach as many people as they can with the the limited the dollars that they receive\nSo how is this being funded in what was the funding cover\nSo they received a two hundred and sixty one thousand dollar grants from the Wisconsin department of justice and\nThat funding would cover the costs of administering the program and they also helped fund treatments services for people they come in contact with as long as dollars are available um you know they might use that grant money\nYou know get them a taxi cab to the treatment center or something like that so that's what the money would be used for\nWe're talking with WNPR news reporter in superior Danielle catering and we want to hear from you have you face the drug related offenses what was your experience would treatment have been your preferred option during that process what do you think eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four ideas WPRI dot org or you can tweet us at WNPR mornings so if someone in this program a successfully complete should but what happens then do they still get charged for the offense\nNo if they successfully complete treatment they won't be charged for the original offense\nBut if they don't meet their obligations under treatment they could be charged with that fence so it's all contingent on whether or not people actually follow through and are able to make it through the treatment services\nSo who's tasked with the with managing the treatment\n[laughter] to the end and superior disappeared police department as contracting with the lake superior community health center and\nThey'll be providing things like a medication to rent in a case where it might be an opioid addiction or because of course there is no medication assisted treatment available for people who have\nUm a math addiction um it might also provide primary care and therapy and they would talk to them in your case management and look at you know all of the reasons why\nPeople might be addicted to drugs you know and housing and food insecurity play a role sometimes and whether or not a person has the ability to stay sober so they will be looking at all of those things to try and encourage people to kick the habit\nNo the ah the ah the grant here is coming from the justice to the Justice Department\nOr is this kind of a change in direction for the Justice Department are traditionally we've kind of just said OK if you've got drugs you're going to jail um and you have any idea why they would support this pilot program\n[noise] well I don't think they would say that um the Wisconsin department of justice I'm sure that attorney general Bradshaw says that they've been working on treatment in diversion programs for the last three years and that they've been doing that\nThrough increased training and I'm dancing or data collection to try and look at places where this might be successful and and they've done a number of treatment aversion programs across the state and put grant money towards that\nUm I think it's becoming a more common now as we've seen that you can't arrest your way out the problem go realized that if you're going to try and keep people out of jail um and reduce the cost taxpayers that way that\nYou got to help people up front um and and give them some services to keep them\nFrom re offending once they're out of jail\nSo this is a a this is a pilot program is being done in three areas in the state of Wisconsin how long is this program expected to run and uh well let's let's go with that question first and then I have a follow up\nOkay I Believe it's a two year program so it would run through I think the end of twenty Nineteen it was supposed to start 'em or is it it's a it's a two year program\nSo at the end of the two years then how would we know if the program has been successful\nI think that they're going to be monitoring it along the way to see whether or not people are remaining clean 'em and if they're helping people and keeping them out of jail uh I think that will be the measure of whether or not this program works\nAnd it let's say that it does work do you uh it does it sound like if a if the program is evaluated and says yeah this works that it could be expanded then to other communities or even state why\nI think that is the hope um but you know one of the barriers for programs like this is that there are not a lot\nOf treatment providers especially in rural areas um a lot of the people I talk to you in law enforcement um and that ... who treat people who have addiction say we need more treatment centers across the state to deal with this crisis especially with opioids\nWe need or treatment center is to be able to really uh make inroads on helping people with their addiction\nLet's take a quick call from Jim who's joining us from Watertown in a gym or we're almost out of time here so ask you to be brief please\nSure okay if you if the rehab centers that you're making air take the time to get the proper information to get to the kids to to allow them to understand why they're getting sick\nAnd yeah it's a good program it's not it's just that training camps to get worse I I ...\nThe only one I ever found that told me what was wrong with my head when I was sick was out of North Carolina it's a state run facility\nPlease get that information to these people so they can get better at reading it ... let's go to a rehab center but if you have the right information get goats apart and you're getting better later\nAll right Jim thanks thanks for that and a Denny we need more treatment centers you pointed out that people are saying this if we want to expand this program Jim and saying okay not only do we need more treatment centers they need to be giving the right message or I don't know how you would respond to that but to take a shot at it anyway\n[laughter] well I think you know he has a point and that\nPeople have to be ready to treat their addiction you know if they're not in that\nPlace yet if you put them in treatment they will be successful so um you know it's a difficult thing to treat it's a problem that's going to keep happening until people are ready whether it's the services that are provided or the person themselves to meet that need\nWell I I Know that you've been you've been following the Wisconsin's drug issues for many many many years and that you'll continue to follow this story what are you looking for a next as this pilot program continues\nTask will just be following it to see how things work out and be checking in um to see what progress is being made and if people are staying and treatment or adding up in jail\nOr anything so much for joining us today appreciate your time Thanks John Daniel ... Wisconsin Public Radio's reporter in superior and host of the regional program here me out I'm John months and this is the morning show on the ideas network [noise]\nAnd you know it's mostly runny nose and cough so influenza you know the the reason it kills people is that it then does lead to the secondary pneumonia is I'm In a fair number of people that are are you know unfortunately going to do them in some times\nWhile in the end NPR had a story recently about a man who actually uh his flu symptoms were so severe he went into organ failure they had to put him in a medically induced coma for about ten days and\nHe was actually in the hospital for fifty eight days as some of these ah sometimes the flu can have the absolutely devastating consequences and yet\nPeople still don't want to get the shot\nYeah his story was particularly interesting in concerning because he was a great example of what otherwise normal healthy person who didn't really think that they're much risk and got ... particularly ill and fortunately survived\nIt seems like the flu is gotten worse in recent years or maybe we're just hearing more about it but the ... this argues that the flu shot is even more important now than it actually than it used to be is this really true or or do we just perceive that the flu has gotten worse [noise] no I think\nThe the over the last ten years I think we've had a couple of particularly serious seasons you know when we see influenza it's usually jumping from animal species or re combining an animal species and so when people talk about bird flu and swine flu and things like that that is genuinely the source of the viruses that they jump from those species than into the human side\nAnd then there's a lot of of recombination and genetic mutations that happened in those viruses they move around and so we have had the emergence of some really interesting strains over the last ten years\n[laughter] let's go to the phones Danny is with us in Racine this morning a Danny good morning welcome to the morning show\nMorning yeah go ahead yeah the the thing I always heard was that uh they have to decide what flu strain to do here before because\nAnd I'll tell you feel that way they'd be like oh it might not even be the correct flu versus sailing crappy first few days are are just going through the whole ... shot\nYeah really annoying yeah yeah really interesting question Danny in and you're actually on to something very interesting so\nYou're right what happens is you know during our summer which is the winter down in the southern hemisphere there's a lot of surveillance that goes on around looking at which viruses are circulating there and then you know over fifty years or so of experience the CDC and the W. H. O.\nCan use that to model and predict what are the virus is going to look like that as they start to circulate here\nBut he's right that they have to make a good estimate by January or February to be able to have enough vaccine available in October when we needed here and so what they've ended up doing is putting multiple strains end of the vaccine so and then people may see when they're out getting their vaccines\nThe discussion of tried bailout versus quandary valence what that means is that they used to put three different strains and the vaccine two types of a and then one type of B\nAnd decided that since they weren't always that good at guessing and the beast rains we now get forest strains and most of the vaccines to different a strains into different the strings [noise]\nSo ah how often to public health officials miss or the right strain and and get it wrong\nWell I I I'd say that about fifty percent of the time the strain that ends up circulating um is not identical to what's in the vaccines but usually they're pretty close to at least getting in the ballpark and this is one of the reasons that when we talk about how well does flu vaccine work\nThe ideas to give you just enough immunity to hopefully prevent you from getting severe disease it may not prevent complete disease because these viruses are constantly changing but at least if we can prevent people from having serious complications we would consider that a win\nOn Facebook Tom commented that he's never had a flu shot because he's never had the flu maybe it's just a coincidence he doesn't know but that's his reason Dr Conway is is this another reason people don't get the shot they just don't feel a sense of urgency because it hasn't affected them yet\nYeah I think there are people that you're particularly careful about hand washing and staying away from sick people and those kinds of things I mean you can certainly minimize your risk of flu\nAnd you know there are for a number of people that you know especially when they're relatively healthy\nUm are are able to to fight off an flew on their own of and certainly some people have had mild flu and actually have some immunity but it is in some ways gambling when you're saying that ah I've gotten through at the past couple of years there's actually a good time to then flip the coin and actually say I'm going to stop gambling and actually protect myself\nWell and we're talking about herd immunity here to talk about that a little bit in terms of vaccination theory\nWell the problem with a A R communities is that not every person can get vaccinated there are certainly people that have allergies to the vaccines or have some medical Contra indication or may not even get full response and the idea of herd immunity\nIs that if enough people in the community are protected that even if somebody enters the community and people are getting off planes everyday with influenza\nAnd entering the country but if somebody hunters that community with influenza the ideas that there's a fire wall of other people that are protected already that then help protect those people that may not be immunized or may not be able to be immunized so herd immunity is really the idea of community immunity having enough people in the community\nProtected said that the virus just can't get hold and start to circulate\nSo good a good hygiene hand washing that kind of thing uh is is that a substitute for getting a flu shot then\nI wouldn't say it's a substitute I'd say it's an augmentation um you know we know that the vaccines aren't perfect but they're pretty good and if you can add in hand washing and hygiene stuff again are perfect but\nAre certainly good the combination of those things and I think does lead to ultimate protection for most people\nWe know that a nearly four hundred\nWere a related um ah illnesses last year just over seven and a half thousand people were hospitalized some people here that instill will probably choose not to get the shot a what's the research say about why people believe what they do when it comes to the flu shot\nWell I mean as you know people have mentioned is one of your Facebook posts mentioned you know a lot of people just don't get the flu if they are and the situations that are careful and so they can get this false sense of security that they're really not at risk a similarly people you know the get the vaccine and and feel like they've got some illness afterwards start\nTo attribute those two things and tie them together and so I think that combination of false sense of security along with fear the vaccine puts ... some people that in a position where they make decisions to leave themselves at risk\nWe're going to continue our conversation about the flu vaccine why haven't you got and you're shot yet if you haven't gotten it eight hundred six four to one two three four Dr Conway stays with us as our conversation continues if the morning show on the ideas that work on ...

the W to read everything could strategy to make its campuses more sustainable\nMy guest says yes what do you think what ... do you think would boost enrollment W's institutions you attend classes at one of these schools are working one and you've seen the impact of these lower numbers and reduced budgets\nEight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas at WNPR dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings\nJohn terrain us is the chairman of Sarah graph incorporated he's also former business journalist and former business editor at the Milwaukee Journal sentinel\nBlogs at Johns arenas dot com and his recent piece there is twenty five you W campuses increasingly strapped for funds\n... welcome to the morning show or a job\nYou write that what we're looking at here is the tale of two university systems you W Madison and the other twenty five campuses that are increasingly strapped for funds how stark is that difference\nWell fortunately our flagship university of which were all extraordinarily proud of your Madison is a [noise] there's doing really really well I mean they've got multiple sources of funding uh as opposed to the other twenty five campuses that are really\nStuck with tuition funding and state support so you know Madison Scott I got a billion dollars and R and D every year mostly from federal dollars [noise] they've got nine billion and foundations 'em over there that's there than than the earnings off of those foundations go back to support the university [noise]\nThey're guaranteed almost I'm a freshman class of thirty six hundred which was the promise they made they take thirty six hundred Wisconsin kids every year as freshmen\nAnd that sort of I guarantee because it's the first choice or a lot of kids so they're\nThey get their thirty six shutter regardless of what's happening on the other twenty five and a show they just have a a surfer they've got to be a health which is a two and a half billion dollar enterprise that ah throws off\nYou don't get Madison despite when when the legislature cuts and the governor cuts\nOr the general purpose revenues for the university and freezes up there watching it that doesn't really affect Madison much because they can they can replace it with other revenues so for instance um I don't think you W mass in fact I Know has cut hardly know positions over the last\nDecade when a when the funds were diminishing on the other campuses so meanwhile I'm pretty connected with your W. um walkie weave in the last three years we've taken out Ninety\nNinety staff positions of about seven hundred so\nYou know the cuts are real at the other at the other campuses\nWell you know the irony of talking about two different systems is that until the late sixties we actually had that there ... there were two separate systems there were two separate boards of regions the so called State University campuses had their own a system and then we combine them\nTo make them more efficient and so you know that's kind of a just a little history of ... kind of how we got to this\nPoint but let's talk about the enrollment at the declining enrollment at the state campuses what kinds of numbers are we seeing here\nLower down about across the system I used to be about a hundred and eighty thousand plus\nStudents across the whole across the twenty six campuses or now about a hundred and Seventy so we've lost about ten thousand students over the last decade\nUh and that's the equivalent of a you know I'll be able to cross a so it's it's a it's significant you know and if you figure maybe there's another seven thousand bucks a student in a time stands out as soon as that Seventy million dollars a year that went away incidentally your your recollection of history Jon is really good ah\nMy aunt Mary minute and Walter was a region in Nineteen Seventy one when they had the last reorganization of the university and that's when they combine the the State University system with the with the W. system so that was for the seven years ago was the last time we took a step back and looked at the structure of our university\nWhile I was I was a college freshman at Wisconsin State University superior when the change happened so I I remember that\nGenerally worked you know I think it's been a good lash up over these forty seven years half a century but at a time to take another look at it and how times have changed\nWell let's talk about how we should all John did I said when I get greater and fatter [laughter] so how did we get here eh ha ha what explains why we're seeing this happen\nWell believe it or not way way down deep but I just wrote a big study on it um\nWhat's really hurting uh the universities public universities across the country as the explosion of health costs of the state level\nAnd that's that's a raging increases for Medicaid big increases for state employees\nAre way above the normal rate of inflation and and also the prisoners so [noise] so what's happening is health cost inflation Hyatt called hyper inflation um is crowding out all of the other priorities in our society including\nA university education K. twelve even public safety um environmental initiatives so that's sort of the car their health costs\nAre are the way way down deep underlying issue and so then when you know when all of the new dollars coming into the state treasurer you have to be have to be used for covering these higher health costs\nAre there's nothing left for anybody else\nSo a higher health conscious and uh maybe some tax cuts that didn't pay for themselves\nYeah well yeah there are so you know so you could go back to governor ... says more than you know twelve years ago and when he came in he was in the middle of the great recession and obviously the\nAs health of late into the state coffers so he he had to make a cut and I think he got two hundred and fifty million out of the out of the state budget went from one point one on a quarter billion dollar to about a billion\nSo then he gets out of office and Walker comes in and he's a he's a fiscal conservative and and they and they're facing these health costs increases well so they take another whack of a couple of hundred million so the state's support for public university system has declined under\nBoth Democratic governors and Republican ... democratic legislators and Republican legislature so [noise] that's been the big plus then on top of that over the last six years they frozen tuition\nSo we're as a W in Milwaukee whereas WC were point going to go for more funds you know the tuitions are caught the G. P. R. dollars are cut and uh and and in Rome is falling off\nYou know it's obviously it's a triple whammy yeah it\nHas this been an issue on the campaign trail is the gubernatorial race winds up towards big conclusion week or two and it has either Governor Walker or a Kennedy toning Uber's made any comments about you W system tuition is is better\nFor sort of a disappointing campaign and that a lot of the large issues in this state of gone unaddressed uh some of them have gone addressed I mean or Tony Evers was talking about more money for K. twelve and then uh you know funding at a two thirds of level of all all local expenses and then\nGovernor Walker follow it on so they're both on that same position so there's been some discussion of education funding generally in the state but but not not neither of them touch the university um [noise] a PR problem the conundrum of the universities face\nWho needs to be setting the strategy for the W system is that the governor's system president regents someone else\nWell what if you talk to the regents that I have a they'll tell you that seldom do they really do any big picture thinking about the university they've got a lot of stuff coming out um um\nIt's a staph driven organization so they get this big stack of papers at every regents meeting and they end up and sort of a middle level issues but they never they never spent a whole lot of time stepping back and saying okay let's let's\nLet's assess where we as a citizenry are with public education at the higher at the higher level or they did make a strategic move recently by and they had to because the cost\nI mean the expenses were not were so high and that's when they decided to merge the Thirteen to your campuses all the colleges you recall any end to the ... system okay we'll\nWe'll come back to that the giant arena is we're at news time but our conversation will continue in just a moment John ... is the chairman and Sarah grant incorporated in a former business journalist and business editor at the Milwaukee Journal sentinel I'm John months in the morning show on the ideas network we'll be right back [noise]\nIf your top line falls off you've got to reorganize the company had to fit the available revenues so I think those ... on those two campuses are doing what they have to do is I think the term out of necessity was used in in in in your earlier a broadcast on your W her\nPiece on new W. O. so out of necessity\nOr Steven's point it was a very or had to make some adjustments and then sort of a move toward specialization and that might be one of the answers are would come out of a blue ribbon commission that going to say okay we've got seven journalism programs in the state or let's cut it down to four\nAnd if some kid from superior wants to get his journalism and that's no longer available as a parent I'm just using that as a hypothetical example them maybe you know he goes to a ... for his journalism or takes on distance learning or takes part of it online\nIn other words rearranging be flexible and nimble and then make the make the disciplines available but not maybe not everywhere\nHow he is or how is the money shared within the U. W. system\nWell roughly there was a little black box over there it's a formula that they used to a lot the general purpose revenues attacks the state taxes among the campuses and were awfully\nIt's about a billion dollars a year or John in about half of that goes to Madison and the other half goes to the other twenty five campuses the formula for divvy up among the um the other twenty five campuses is a little murky and I I don't want to have the I don't take only a few people really know what's inside that black box [noise]\nYeah and and it always seems from the perspective of the campus his own state that Madison seems to get more than its share and the that the perception probably will never get away\nUm ... you mentioned splitting you W Madison from the rest of the system that's not a new idea and I'm sure you remember what happened the last time it was proposed\nConsidering where we're at now does it make sense to revisit the idea\nYeah I think so that was chancellor Biddy Martin that's two ... ago who will propose a spin off of your job your Madison largely because they can solve fund if they want to and it wasn't met with uh [noise] uh too much support at the time but you know flash forward were were five ten years down the road since then and\nAnd the the financing crisis all call call it is a is sharper now than it was then so it might take take time to look at it I had one very smart guy and he said well why don't what what is your W Madison and the health care of business for why don't they spin off you will be a health and they could maybe pick up a couple of billion dollars and [noise]\nAnd so they spit it out there is a couple of billion dollars turn that ... billion over to the twenty five campuses and let Madison go merrily on its way and incidentally I don't think any of us should want to diminish your W Madison it is a fantastic\nOrganization doing great researched\nThat keep happening but it just is on any Congress fit with the rest of the system at this point\nAnd we're just about out of time here hum or we're getting rapidly to that point any time we talk about stuff like this we also return to the question of whether or not any changes would go against the Wisconsin Idea it John as you see it is there a way to make the university system sustainable and preserve the Wisconsin Idea\nYeah I think that's the essence of a job or you know I don't see too much impact from Utah via Madison over in West bend Wisconsin where I live I I Love their graduates by the way to have a good number of I'm working at my company and invariably they end up being leaders in the company so their their their main product their export is are graduates but I don't see\nA lot of other impacts so you know they they'd impacts Dane County heavily I Would even be a little bit uh\nTalking a chicken call at the University of Dane County university Wisconsin Dane County a show I think\nYou know they could be independent and and serve the greater purposes of mankind is a great research university I instill a and then set up the rest of the system a regional basis to serve the local economy is better\nAt one thing we haven't mentioned it and it's always it always comes up in the discussion do you think the U. W. needs to close them campuses\nLaw that always comes up at I don't ah that would take some intense analysis [noise] um I think you could do thing you could consider things that I'm not advocating any one of these cars you got to do the work you've got to do the analysis John you can't just\nDo him shots at a but for instance you W superior could be you know a ... a mated with sale Claire and uh you W park side could be an automated with your W Markey so there are things you could do to to cut some administrate of overheads and [noise]\nAnd then mix and match the course offerings up those campuses so that you know a kitten so period a kid than a\nA near park side or could still have you know get into the disciplines that he wants to do\nAnd we're ... we're not a time my pre she ate

Wisconsin's fifth congressional district\nDemocrat Tom Paul's which is a small business owner a navy veteran according to his campaign website he's running against incumbent Republican congressman Jim Sensenbrenner\nTom good morning and welcome to the morning show\nGood morning John thanks for having me on let's start out with the wind your running to represent a fifth congressional district\nReally a couple of different reasons first and foremost so I'm looking back you know looking at the history of this country uh it's it's been a while since we've had a vision for where we really want to go\nAnd I looked at a um congressman Jim Sensenbrenner who's been in office for forty years he's never really not providing any leadership in that area and I just really feel that we need to create a vision of where we want to get to and put down some goals to say here's what we need to start doing next in order to start moving the country in the direction we're going and because we don't have that\nUh right now we're subject to what happens on a daily basis and I've been talking to a lot of people over the last six to twelve months and people are just anxious about where we are\nWell on your campaign website you talk about health care and that as being a right that everyone in this country should have access to and universal healthcare is the only logical solution to our country's healthcare needs is that part of your vision for the future\nAbsolutely we view healthcare is a right not a privilege most of the other developed countries and on the planet have already figured this out and we're falling behind what in regards to health care and plus there's so many people who worry about whether they're going to have the health care they need\nThe interesting thing now is we have this incredibly expensive system and people are reticent to actually use it or just because they know going into a doctor's gonna gonna cost the money that they don't have why is universal healthcare the only option\nWas not the only option I think some kind of single payer system getting to that is going to take some time there are about two and a half to three million dollar three million jobs in the health insurance industry that will have to figure out\nHow to relocate but the bottom line is is people should be able to understand that their health is not going to be an impediment to having a job or starting a business or just living their lives\nTom Paul's which is a a a ... a Democrat running in Wisconsin's fifth congressional district he faces incumbent Republican congressman Jim Sensenbrenner how does your experience in finance and as a small business owner relate to the work that you do in Congress\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public

Wisconsin Public Radio's reporter in superior and host of the regional program here me out Danny good morning thanks for joining us\nGood morning John\nSo first of all let's talk about what's behind this rate increase a request from superior water light in power\nThey have their requesting this rate increase for a number of reasons um one that they face the most important is because they're making major improvements to upgrade their system\nAre carrying a lot of water mains and minds in the city and they're also during work at their water treatment plant and they're repairing an electric grid or out of electric station\nI'm In the city and so that's one reason that they're saying that this is important that they need to raise rates right now\nI'm In another part of that is the fact that the energy a series of fires are back in April and there are a superior water towers largest water utility cost right age twenty five percent\nOffer to get this person help 'em um and that's all aimed at reducing recidivism\nShow or who would who would be the the fans must be non violent of who else is is that the only criteria for eligibility what else\n[noise] well yeah the offense would have to be non violent so you know if someone were to commit a crime when they were high on drugs and they were hurting someone that would obviously probably not be a candidate to take part in this pilot program\nI'm usually it's the people who are can emitting property crimes like they're stealing shoplifting to support their habit\nThose are the type of people that um agencies come in contact with um that would be a old to take advantage of treatment rather than being put in jail or because of this being a drug use\nUse their sense of how many people of these three communities my hope to serve [noise]\n\nI don't think so at this time I think you know it's fairly new I think they're hoping that they'll serve I'm Out a lot of people so that they can keep them from using other\nA taxpayer dollar you know as far as the amount of overcrowding in that they see in the jails here that's been an issue in here and elsewhere in northern Wisconsin\nI'm I Know that it will be available to residents of Douglas County even though it is if you're a police department that received the grant and it will be the same in 'em sock county\nEven though the thought Craig police department or the background they're hoping to reach as many people as they can with it the limited the dollars that they receive\nSo how is this being fun\nSo they received a two hundred and sixty one thousand dollar grants from the Wisconsin department of justice\nAnd that funding would cover the costs of administering the program and it may also help um bond treatment services for people they come in contact with as long as dollars are available\nUm you know they might use that grant money to send people you know get them a taxi cab to the treatment center or something like that so that's what the money would be used for\nWe're talking with WNPR news reporter in superior Daniel catering and we want to hear from you have you face the drug related offenses what was your experience with treatment have been your preferred option during that process what do you think eight hundred six four to one two three four hundred six four to\nOne two three four ideas of WNPR dot org or you can tweet us at WNPR mornings so\nIf someone in this program a successfully complete should so what happens then do they still get charged for the fence\nYou know if they successfully complete treatment they won't be charged for the original offense\nBut if they don't meet their obligations under treatment they could be charged with that a fence so it's all contingent on whether or not people actually follow through and are able to make it through the treatment services\nShow who's tasked with the was managing the treatment\nTo the end and superior disappeared police department is contracting with the lake superior community health center and they'll be providing and things like\nA medication treatment in a case where it might be an opioid addiction or because of course there is no medication assisted treatment available for people who have\nUm a math addiction um it might also provide primary care and therapy and they would talk to them in your case management and look at you know all of the reasons why\nPeople might be addicted to drugs you know and housing and food insecurity play a role sometimes and whether or not a person has the ability to stay sober so they will be looking at all of those things to try and encourage people to kick the habit\nThough the ah the ah the grant here is coming from the justice to the Justice Department\nOr is this kind of a change in direction for the Justice Department are traditionally we've kind of just said OK if you've got drugs you're going to jail um and you have any idea why they would support this pilot program\nWell I don't think they would say that um the Wisconsin department of justice I'm sure you attorney general Bradshaw says that they've been working on treatment in diversion programs for the last three years and that they've been doing that\nThrough increased training and I'm dancing or data collection to try and look at places where this might be successful and and they've done a number of treatment and diversion programs across the state and put grant money towards that\nUm I think it's becoming a more common now as we've seen that you can't arrest your way out the problem go realized that if you're going to try and keep people out of jail um and reduce the cost taxpayers outweigh\nThat you've got to help people up front um and and give them some services to keep them from re offending once they're out of jail\nSo this is a a this is a pilot program is being done in ...\nDid Wisconsin how long is this program expected to run and uh well let's let's go with that question first and then I have a follow up\nOkay I Believe it's a two year program so it would run through I think the end of twenty Nineteen it was supposed to start 'em or is it it's a it's a two year program\nSo at the end of the two years then how would we know if the program has been successful\n[noise] that's a good question um I think that they're going to be monitoring it along the way to see whether or not people are remaining clean 'em and if they're helping people and keeping them out of jail\nUm I think that will be the measure of whether or not this program works\nAnd it would say that it does work do you uh it does it sound like if a if the program has evaluated and says yeah this works that could be expanded then or to other communities or even stay why\nI think that is the hope um but you know one of the barriers for programs like this is that there are not a lot of treatment providers especially in rural areas\nUm a lot of the people I talk to you in law enforcement um and that ... who treat people who have addiction say we need more treatment centers across the state to deal with this crisis especially with opioids\nWe need or treatment center is to be able to really uh make inroads on helping people at their addiction\nLet's take a quick call from Jim who's joining us from Watertown in a gym or we're almost out of time here so ask you to be brief please\nSure okay if you if the rehab centers at your for your baking here take the time to get the proper information to get to the kids or\nTo to allow them to understand why they're getting sick and yeah it's a good program if not it's just a training camp to get worse I I ... the only one I ever\nFound that told me what was wrong with my head when I was sick or was out of North Carolina at the state run facility\nPlease get that information to these people so they can get better at one they're ready at wall here you go to a rehab center but if you have the right information that took part and you're getting better later\nAll right Jim thanks a matter of thanks for that and Danny we need more treatment centers you pointed out that people are saying this if we want to expand this program Jim and saying okay not only do we need more treatment centers they need to be giving the right message or I don't know how you would respond to that but to take a shot at it anyway\n[laughter] well I think you know he has a point and that people have to be ready to treat their addiction you know if they're not in that place yet if you put them in treatment they won't be successful so um you know it's a difficult thing to treat\nIt's a problem that's going to keep happening until people are ready whether at the services that are provided or the person themselves to meet that need\nWell I I Know that you've been you've been following the Wisconsin's drug issues for many many many years and then you'll continue to follow the story what are you looking for a next as of this pilot program continues\nTask will this be following it to see how things work out and be checking in on to see what progress is being made and if people are staying and treatment or adding up in jail\nAlready Danny thanks so much for joining us today appreciate your time Thanks John Daniel ... Wisconsin Public Radio's reporter in superior and host of the regional program here me out [noise] I'm John months and this is the morning show on the ideas network\n'em and you know it's mostly runny nose and cough so influenza\nYou know the the reason it kills people is that it then does lead to the secondary pneumonia is I'm In a fair number of people that are are you know unfortunately going to do them in some times\nWell in the end NPR had a story recently about a man who actually uh his flu symptoms were so severe he went into organ failure they had to put him in a medically induced coma for about ten days and he was actually in the hospital for fifty eight days as some of these\nAh sometimes the flu can have the absolutely devastating consequences and yet\nPeople still don't want to get the shot\nYeah his story was particularly interesting in concerning because he was a great example of an otherwise normal healthy person who didn't really think that there had much risk and got ... particularly ill and fortunately survived it\nSeems like the flu is gotten worse in recent years or maybe we're just hearing more about it but the ... this argues that the flu shot is even more important now than it actually than it used to be is this really true or or do we just perceive that the flu has gotten worse [noise] no I think\nThe the over the last ten years I think we've had a couple of particularly serious seasons you know when we see influence it's usually jumping from animal species or re combining an animal species and so when people talk about\nThat's genuinely the the source of the viruses that they jumped from those species than into the human side and then there's a lot of of recombination and genetic mutations that happened in those viruses they move around and so we have had the emergence of some really interesting strains over the last ten years\n[laughter] let's go to the phones Danny is with us in are seeing this morning at Danny good morning welcome to the morning show\nMore yeah go ahead yeah the\nThe thing I always heard was that uh they have to decide what\nFlu strain kid to the year before because of the time it takes to actually make the vaccination and I'll tell you feel that way I like it might not even be the correct flu versus scaling crappy for a few days are are just going through the whole ... shot\nYeah really annoying yeah yeah really interesting question Danny in and you're actually onto something very interesting so you're right what happens is you know during our summer which is the winter down in the southern hemisphere there's a lot of surveillance that goes on around looking at which viruses are circulating there and then\nYou know over fifty years or so of experienced the CDC and the W. H. O. can use that to model and predict what the virus is going to look like then as they start to circulate here\nBut he's right that they have to make a good estimate by January or February to be able to have enough vaccine available walk in October when we needed here and so what they've ended up doing is putting multiple strains into the vaccine so and then people may see when they're out getting their vaccines\nThe discussion of try veil and versus quandary available what that means is that they used to put three different strains and the vaccine two types of a and then one type of B and decided that since they weren't always that good at guessing on the beast rains we now get four strings and most of the vaccines to different a strains in two different the strings [noise]\nSo ah how often do public health officials miss or the right strain and and get it wrong\nWell I I I'd say that about fifty percent of the time the strain that ends up circulating um is not an identical to what's in the vaccines but usually they're pretty close to at least getting in the ballpark and this is one of the reasons that when we talk about how well does flu vaccine work\nThe ideas to give you just enough immunity to hopefully prevent you from getting severe disease it may not prevent complete disease because these viruses are constantly changing but at least if we can prevent people from having serious complications we would consider that a win [noise]\nOn Facebook Tom commented that he's never had a flu shot because he's never had the flu maybe it's just a coincidence he doesn't know but that's his reason Dr Conway is is this another reason people don't get the shot they just don't feel a sense of urgency because it hasn't affected them yet\nYeah I think there are people that you know you're particularly careful about hand washing and staying away from sick people in those kinds of things I mean you can certainly minimize your risk of flu\nAnd you know there are a fair number of people that you know especially when they're relatively healthy um are are able to to fight off um flew on their own of and certainly some people have had mild flu and actually have some immunity\nBut it is in some ways gambling when you're saying that ah I've gotten through it the past couple of years there's actually a good time to then flip the coin and actually say I'm going to stop gambling and actually protect myself\nWell and we're talking about herd immunity here to talk about that a little bit in terms of vaccination theory\nWell the problem with a A R communities is that not every person can get vaccinated there are certainly people that have allergies to the vaccines or have some medical Contra indication or may not even get full response and the idea of herd immunity\nIs that if enough people in the community are protected that even if somebody enters the community and people are getting off planes every day with influenza and entering the country but if somebody enters that community with influenza the ideas that there's a fire wall of other people that are protected already that then help protect those people that may not be\nTim unity is really the idea of community immunity having enough people in the community protected so that the virus just can't get hold and start to circulate\nSo good a good hygiene hand washing that kind of thing uh is is that a substitute for getting a flu shot then\nI wouldn't say it's a substitute I'd say it's an augmentation um you know we know that the vaccines aren't perfect but they're pretty good and if you can add in hand washing and hygiene stuff again are perfect but are certainly good the combination of those things and I think does lead to ultimate protection for most people\nWe know that a nearly four hundred people died in Wisconsin from the flu or a related um ah illnesses last year just over seven and a half thousand people were hospitalized some people here that instill will probably choose not to get the shot\nA what's the research say about why people believe what they do when it comes to the flu shot\nWell I mean as you know people mentioned is one of your Facebook posts mentioned you know a lot of people just don't get the flu if they are in\nSome situations that are careful and so they can get this false sense of security that they're really not at risk\nUm similarly people you know the get the vaccine and and feel like they've got some illness afterwards start to attribute those two things and tie them together and so I think that combination of false sense of security along with your other vaccine puts ... some people that in a position where they make decisions to leave themselves at risk\nWe're going to continue our conversation about the flu vaccine why haven't gotten your shot yet if you haven't gotten it eight hundred six four to one two three four Dr Conway stays with us as our conversation continues is the morning show on the ideas that work on John monsoon\n[noise]\nHere's the weather forecast to start out the week Sunday and most of the state today with increasing clouds in the north heights in the fifties\nTuesday a few rain or snow showers possible in the morning otherwise mostly sunny hides in the forties\nSunny for Wednesday with heights in the mid to upper forties and partly to mostly cloudy on Thursday a chance of rain or snow showers in the northwestern part of the state hides in the mid forties this is Wisconsin Public radio\n\nComing up next is on point go behind the headlines from the economy and health care to politics and the environment and so much more he's got you covered with on point next on the ideas network\nI'm Camille have any of my own a a proud supporter of Wisconsin Public radio I decided after I'm gone I wanted Wisconsin Public radio to reap the benefits of my state\nI mean I'm going to be gone I don't need it what better thing to do than to leave that to Wisconsin Public radio my very own legacy include us in your state plan visit WPRI legacy dot org [noise]\nWisconsin Public radio is the surface of the Wisconsin educational communications board and the University of Wisconsin Madison with additional financial support from the corporation for public broadcasting and from listeners do the Wisconsin Public radio association\nSupport also comes from greater Madison vision offering a ten minute survey gathering public input on regional growth in twenty five years this area could grow by one hundred fifty thousand people the survey is at greater Madison vision dot com\nListening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at that\nHey stuck at the ideas network\nIt's the morning show on the ideas don't work I'm John months and we're talking about the flu shot the flu season is here but many people haven't been backs vaccinated yes\nIf you haven't gotten the shot yet why not what questions do you have about the vaccine eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas at WNPR dot org or you can tweet us at WNPR mornings\nDr James Conway\nIs with us this morning he is the associate director for health sciences at the global health Institute at the University of Wisconsin Madison and he is also a pediatric infectious disease specialist", "show_name": "Morning Show",
