generate electricity\nAnd the associated climate differences large scale wind farms may also introduce we Miller welcome to the morning show and thank you so let's talk about your findings how our wind farms connected to temperature change [noise]\nWell I'm at night when and that the air and near the surface and the air aloft aloft being maybe two hundred meters isn't well mixed and and I'm very simple way wind turbines just like a fan introduced mixing\nAds that air mixing in between those two layers and you get a surface temperature increase in response\nSo why why does\nThis um\nWhy wouldn't this happen if there were just normal breezes occurring for\nWater so yeah I mean that that's a great question said during the day I'm the typical raises you get a lot of solar heating up the ground surface and it drives convection or from the bottom up just like a it's a a a pot of hot water on the stove\nBarber Becker is the Milwaukee office director for disability rights Wisconsin\nThe protection an advocacy system for Wisconsin nights with disabilities\nShe also serves as the coordinator for DIRW use help America vote act program and staff the Wisconsin disability vote coalition a program of yard W and Wisconsin board for people with developmental disabilities Barbara welcome to the morning show\nThank you good morning\nSo let's talk about some of the barriers to the disabled community of when they attempted to exercise their civic duty and cast a ballot how how is transportation become a barrier for example\nAh yes well thank you for that question ah many people with disabilities do not drive either because of their disability or because they may be low income and that can be a barrier in terms of access to voting in Wisconsin\nI it can also be a barrier to getting a photo ID again that's become a requirement and the state of Wisconsin for voting and because so many people with disabilities do not have a driver's license that can also lead to disenfranchisement at the polls\nShow how to poll workers present a barrier to voters with disabilities\nAnd I think one thing that's important is to have more education of a poll workers about what their requirements side of the legal requirements are to ensure that there's accessibility at the polls are\nFor example uh I recently had an experience with voting each polling place is required to have an accessible voting machine that's the law I'm based on the help America vote act ah when I went to my polling place\nI found that the poll workers were not aware of this requirement they didn't know that there was an accessible voting machine a yeah I've talked to other individuals and helps file complaints where they went to their polling place\nAnd an accessible voting machine was not available so that's one area I think also understanding or some of the other aspects of accommodations that people with disabilities\nAre are entitled to isn't port and in terms of education and poll workers so some of those might include the right to have someone assist them with voting or the responsibility to provide curbside voting ensure that that is\nCannot enter the polling place of course we hope that our polling places are accessible and that that's not an issue but unfortunately that's not the case in every polling place well opportunity is to ensure that more people with disabilities are trained as poll workers I think that's one of the most promising options\nWell ... are a lot of polling places are in a county or municipal buildings which should already be accessible but some are in other types of buildings which may or not\nUh not be and so there's probably I Would guess across the state some inconsistency here do you have an idea of um of uh where we have more problems is that in cities is in rural areas where where do we see the most to issues here\nThat's a great question um disability rights Wisconsin works with the Wisconsin election commission to address accessibility and the polling places than\nOn a major elections including the one in November sex we actually will be going out I having trained members of our staff along with the Wisconsin election commission and their staff going to audit polling places across the states I'd love to come back and talk with the afterwards and share what we've learned\nI think historically that there may be additional barriers in rural areas voters and they have a a longer travel time to get to the polling place and there may be greater concerns about accessibility there but honestly we do see problems across the board\nWell let's hear from some citizens with disabilities in northern Wisconsin and the challenges they face this was put together as part of WNPR it's beyond a ballad project by reporter Daniel ... and features rich skirt pitch a John new sane and Steve Carlson talking about what they'd like to see addressed this election season\nRich or you're going to vote in this election this fall and why\nI Am going to vote in this election and this is one of the most important things that we do as citizens can you tell us why it's important for people with disabilities in particular to vote there's a lot of issues that reflect and affect\nPeople with disabilities and some of the examples that affect people with disabilities are um public transportation personal care assistance\nAnd accessibility in general employment opportunities health coverage and benefits for people with disabilities and what's the single most important issue to you in this election\nWell there's a lot of them so it's hard to say the single most important one but transportation transportation in northwestern Wisconsin is a really tough nut to crack there's very few places that have public transportation superior as one that does have mainline NPR transit\nAnybody else in Douglas County is going to have a really hard time finding a ride all the public kind of transportation that we can get will benefit all our citizens but in particular people with disabilities what would you say it's an important issue in this election\nSees the Medicaid expansion\nThat's been a big stumbling block here in Wisconsin is not only affected people with disabilities in terms of\nAn inability to expand our program crucial to keeping folks were disabilities independent and the community by the lack of the expansion has contributed to higher premiums\nFor people buying policies on the open exchange\nHow do you think things have changed related to disability issues over time and in the political arena\nI cut my teeth on disability rights with the Americans with Disabilities Act and ever since that time I think it put the\nOut there in front of everybody it was a wake up call to America in my opinion that we have to consider the concerns of people with disabilities before that it was really tough to get anybody to really care\nYou know um if it doesn't affect them and I'm the same way I mean it's human nature I was not affected by any disability stuff until something happened to me\nYou know I'm a I'm a single amputee I was injured in construction accent when I was twenty four and when I woke up in the hospital I had some questions about am I going to be able to do this stuff a year later\nThat was not the biggest concern I had in my life and it isn't today so um that disability experience teaches us that you know this is just a naturally occurring thing it's always going to be with us it's always going to be with society and certainly nothing to be feared\nThere is a very fine line between people with disabilities and people in general where people first and it really is true that sooner or later everybody's going to have a disability murder lose your hearing that's going to be harder to walk around you might end up in a wheelchair with a tune\nDisability issues or people issues\nI feel the root of all barriers is that stigma attached to disability it sounds like a simplistic answer but I think if we get past that\nThat we can be inclusive and more inclusive to people [noise]\nBarber or respond to what we heard I mean there was a lot there but to give us your take on what we just listened to\nYeah well first of all kudos to our speakers I think they had a very important message and that\nIs that um any one of us is likely to develop a disability in our lifetime it's uh the only minority group that anyone of us might join at any time and I think that's why we all have a stake in ensuring that there is equal access to voting for voters with disability\nSo ... there were those these voters were talking about the conditions in northern Wisconsin let's talk about the unique challenges that rural voters face\n[laughter] well I think uh the comments by transportation are particularly relevant I can be a long distance to travel to the polling place and there is not the same access to public transportation that we have in some of the more urban areas of our state and that further reinforces\nWhy it's so important for people with disabilities and their family members and others who care\nAbout access to voting rights and to all of the um\nAll of the services in our community to get involved because the choices that people make at the ballot box have a direct impact on\nFuture access to transportation our policy makers will be making important decisions about policies that have an impact on those issues and that have\nThe ability to transform the independence of people with disabilities\nBarbara Becker is the Milwaukee office director for disability rights Wisconsin and also serves as the coordinator for the help America vote act program\nDo you have a disability what has your experience been at the polls have your face some challenges what combinations are needed in order to ensure that you can vote what questions do you have about resources for voters with disabilities\nAccess in the city at Madison um I had a number of issues\nThat challenge for me in voting has always been um having and accessible ballot um there is a is there are accessible voting machines a prior to the city of Madison having\nBetter technology there was a machine called the auto mark and um when I Would get to my polling place I Would have to work through my own\nFeelings of not wanting to stand out um or feel different or feel less than by having to ask to use that piece of equipment and that piece of equipment and many polling places is often kind of shoved to the back of the polling place\nI used to be the auto mark was about eight hundred pound gorilla so\nIt it took up a lot of space it was noticeable you clearly stood out as different if you were using\nThat piece of equipment versus one of the you know the the\nUh the carols that are there for voters to fill out their ballot it often didn't work um the ink cartridges dry out in them so you know you go through the whole procedure of using it and then your ballot doesn't print so you kind of back at square one and then do you decide\nGosh I'll just live with filling out a paper ballot I'm seeing the paper ballot is always very difficult for me I'm I'm\nAble to do it with um a lot of effort um so I always beside filled out a paper ballot versus using the auto mark\nI had to bring 'em a magnifying glass and\nI had it because I didn't want them to think I was doing something weird you know at the uh when I was filling up my ballot\nUm and it would always take me longer because you know there's only a certain amount of the ballot you can see when you use a really strong magnifying glass or my other option was to ask my spouse to a complete the ballot with me and I'm\nIn while my spouse is always very willing to do that and very generous about it and I trust this person to\nEnter my information accurately there's still some thing uncomfortable about having someone else complete your ballot 'em and other other voters are noticing that you know it's like why is that person\nDoing this person's ballot so it's just a lot of 'em just comfort and ... and never quick you know I'd watch other voters come in\nAnd get two or three people would vote and the time that it would take me to vote so I always needed to build in time for\nBeing able to complete my ballot and not feeling rushed through it\nBarbara comment on what you just heard from the news\nYeah well thank you Denise for such an import and calm and carry on voting rights\nI think it's important for everyone to understand that this is actually the law it's not just something that's nice to do to help America vote act states that casting a ballot needs to be accessible for individuals with disabilities including non visual accessibility for the blind and visually impaired\nAnd a manner that provides the same opportunity for access and participation as for other voters\nSo while some good progress has been made as Denise points out we have a long way to go and ensuring that voters with disabilities are aware of their rights the poll workers are sufficiently trained and that that technology is both available and good working order that's not always the case so\nWe got a good word to do together\nWhat about I mean a Denise ... was talking about you know the the need not to have these things kind of be shoved dogs into a dark corner or be made to feel\nA difference or somehow it impeding the voting process for others um uh the way she was made to feel at the polling please talk about what that's like\nYeah I really think that a best practice is if poll workers ask every voter when they come to the polling place would you like to have a paper ballot or use the accessible voting machine that way everyone is informed of this right and I've heard from a lot of people that\nThey've really appreciated that um you know I've talked to a voter who isn't able to do is not visually impaired but without her reading glasses\nHas difficulty reading the ballots so she was really appreciative of the opportunity to use the accessible voting machine it's a technology that many people can benefit from\nSo I think that that's the best practice for our poor workers for\nWhat a combination specifically are available to voters would visual or hearing impairments we haven't talked about talked about the hearing impaired yet either\nUh well I think that there are several different accommodations that are available first of all I'm the voting machine because of the fact that it provides the detailed information on the screen\nIs something that is beneficial to many voters who have a hearing impairment in addition to that um as we've mentioned a voter has the\nAsk someone to assist them so those are probably the most important and accommodations\nBarbara Becker is the Milwaukee County or excuse me the Milwaukee office director for disability rights Wisconsin she also serves as the coordinator for the help America vote act program\nAnd when we come back we will talk about the help America vote act program and how that plays into this discussion [noise] do you have a disability what has your experience been at the polls what questions do you have about resources for voters with disabilities\nOr what political issues are important to you as a citizen with a disability we heard about a we heard some of those earlier in

restored of justice\n[laughter] well it is a philosophical approach\nTo trying to heal hire him after it's occurred and more specifically on the area we were discussing today it's a victim focus price or to help the victim and others around him or her to heal and so unlike the criminal justice system\nWhere the whole system is geared at figuring out who committed the crime whether we can prove him or her guilty and how we're going to have a fat person\nThis is really figuring out who was hired what the nature of the hour was and and hopefully work toward healing more specifically I think it's

and their coaches we've used it anytime that there is harm you can use these processes to try to open a dialogue and to be able to have people address some of their concerns\nBut I Want to say on the forefront that all this takes incredible amount of preparation and working with all the parties before you have this dialogue\nOf course a sexual assault and how our system treats it has been top of mind for many Americans lightly so much talk about how restored to justice or can work with in this context how would that work\nOut well and I done I have done a number of these kinds of cases most sexual assault cases are handled post conviction that is after the case has been through the system and offenders been found guilty and often sentenced to prison\nNow there's no reason it it has to follow that path but that's how most of them are the first thing that happens is at some\nPoint a survivor makes a decision and I'm going to use she although we have ... obviously male survivors that she desires to have such a meeting that's often in conjunction with her therapy\nUm sometimes for years and years after the crime and we will we will have her into the office to have a discussion with her about why she wants to meet with the offender\nMany times is a desire to look at the offender in the eyes and tell him or her what the harm is that ... was the cause is because of the ... fault\nNot just the physical harm but primarily the psychological higher which can be a ... at a replicable then um after we have that discussion with the victim and assuming\nThat the victims motivations are good and and she has some questions she wants to ask the offender there'll be some other things\nWe then go and meet finally offender and meet with the offender who's often very surprised\nThat a victim wants to meet with him um and we talked to him about it if he says I didn't commit the crime I wasn't there if it's a bit of the end of the discussion because we don't have these meetings to decide who did it\nBut if he admits he did something and he was there even if you mitigate said we have a discussion with him about the possibility of meeting with a victim it has to be consensual on all sides\nAnd whatever he says that we go back to the victim and said\nYou know he's going to give you these kinds of answers you still want to meet with them and we go back and forth between the parties often for six or nine months before we ultimately have the meeting and then eventually get to a place where they are both prepared and the facilitator\nTakes the victim to wherever the offender is and we have a ... hour um dialogue the ... the ... primary um advantaged all this is those kinds of processes\nQuestions answers can never happen courtroom I sat in sexual assault court I saw what happened to Arnold saw was the victim sort\nOf felt out there hanging after the offender was sentenced and never got an answer is to me the questions he has so it gives her an opportunity to get those answers which often help\nSo does this cost anything and if so who pays\nNo we ... Wisconsin um our tradition has not been to charge um the ones I Do or pro bono um the University of Wisconsin I'm law school and um there's a program run by Jonathan chairs one of my former students\nHe worked for clinical students is also free so there's no expense to it we provide this as a service people\nIs this will be a little state wide or just in in Madison or in in Madison\nNo we do the statewide um and um it depends because I I'm semi retired but so Jonathan's program takes more than I Do and there are a few other facilitators available statewide\nBut we find where ... ... who is located closest to where the victim is so that she ... she or he can easily get to meetings with us\nAnd then we travel all over the state because many of these offenders in prisons all over the fate [noise] um but I both of us had no have worked in northern Wisconsin and western Wisconsin on particular cases\nSo what does restored of justice on for survivors that the traditional justice system or does it you alluded to this earlier but I'd like to a lab or a just a little bit more\nSure well ... the first thing is it allows a survivor to look at the offender and say this is what has happened to my life because of what you did to me you know my marriage broke up um I no longer felt safe I just didn't feel comfortable dating anymore\nI'm I'm I'm a different person my family broke up over all the all the ripples as we call it that occur as a result of a sexual assault and there are reports that the deep deep impact of an assault\nUm changes people's lives and they talk about their life before in their life after so she can tell him that look him in the face Ellen that\nShe then can ask them questions who are you why if a stranger assault why did you pick me out like you know was was ... where I was what I was wearing\nWhy did you pick my apartment because there's a lot of fear that the offenders gonna come back and attack and that's rarely the case but the victim has those fears then they will say well tell me about your life tell\nMe how you grow up but have you done this before and then she will move into what have you been doing in prison since you got here have you been in program you know because the victims have a deep desire that they not come the fender not reached commander offense against someone else\nSo you have been uh you're you're retired but at least partially but you don't spend a lot of your time on restore to justice or why do you care so deeply about this line of work\n[noise] um I my husband left that\nNow I work full time for free um I I Love this where it really for me there's a spiritual base it just for me I don't in check my religion or my face but there is incredible transformational for me there's a spiritual oversight on this\nThat that I have seen such amazing things happen I've worked with a maze ing survivors the strengths that they have I mean I had one man whose daughter was killed in a drunk driving um she was a student you W and he came in\nAnd said to me that he wanted to meet with the um a fender\nBecause he wanted to make life better because he wanted to give meaning to his daughter's death and I think I ever be in the in those shoes\nAnd so to be able to have people like that meet the offender and have those discussions is really very powerful and and then the international and national studies on crimes generally often smaller crimes is\nThat in these processes in fact do um reduce the amount of recidivism ... increase victims satisfaction with with the system\nAnd also increases the amount of restitution that ultimately gets paid um the United states is behind the time I'm doing this this these processes that are occurring all over the world I I actually went to around a couple of years ago to a conference on sort of justice\nUm and ah it's in the European Union documents it's in the un documents and are these processes are being used and lots and lots of cultures in order to heal in order to have some healing we know that just jailing somebody um me protect the public for a period of time\nBut it doesn't it doesn't get to the heart of what we need to do which is having fun to understand the harm and to be able to heal the victims\n... it sounds like a resort of justice is a very therapeutic effect on survivors but you're very careful not to call a therapy was that\nAh well I'm not a therapist and and so I'm not doing the or in fact especially in the sexual assault\nCases I always inquire as to whether the victim has been through therapy I'd like to talk to the therapist I prefer if I can have the therapist engaged in the process we provide a a a process that we listen that we support a victim\nWhat happened um and and to be able to go through this process where the facilitator\nBut we're not looking at the deep psychological I mean I can see some of the changes that happened but I'm not there to try to push those or to decide what's best for victims but I\nHave to say you know not only has a very victim that I worked with than happy with their prices are at least felt that it did some good\nEvery offender has also given me that feedback that some of 'em fate is the most important thing that they've ever engaged and\nYou know they can't believe the victims willing to listen to them\nAnd um they really do feel like they're helping to heal from harm by be willing to sit in a very difficult conversation\nA more colleges are looking at restore to justice is a way to address sexual assault a best way to bomb US education secretary has shown support for alternative approaches to handling those cases do you see this as a positive change\n[noise] well I it's a positive change to be talking about it I I Am concerned\nThat we don't get in a place where we're forcing victims to have this as an alternative to the court system and first of all a lot of offenders just need to go through the court system for supervision purposes to make sure\nThat you know to the other ... than other victims are not being being developed but um and so I think that when\nI think that some of the department of education was looking well let me we could have started justice instead of a for a formal disciplinary presses and a lot of us in the field are very concerned about that\nFirst of all if you're doing really quickly after the um crime often the victims still very traumatized\nAnd we were bought out of time here for those interested in learning more about restored adjustments very quickly a work and they find more information\nWell ... the primary um

advocacy system for Wisconsin writes with disabilities she also serves as the coordinator for DIRW use help America vote act program\nAnd stamps the Wisconsin disability vote coalition a program of yard W and Wisconsin board for people with developmental disabilities Barbara welcome to the morning show\nThank you good morning\nSo let's talk about some of the barriers to the disabled community or when they attempted to exercise their civic duty and cast a ballot how how is transportation become a barrier for example [noise]\nAh yes well thank you for that question ah many people\nWith disabilities do not drive either because of their disability or\nBecause they made the low income and that can be a barrier in terms of access to voting in Wisconsin I can also be a barrier to getting a photo ID again that's become a requirement and the state of Wisconsin for voting and because so many people with\nDisabilities do not have a driver's license that can also lead to disenfranchisement at the polls\nSo how to poll workers present a barrier to voters with disabilities\nAnd I think one thing that's important is to have more education\nOf a poll workers about\nWhat their requirements side of the legal requirements are to ensure that there's accessibility at the polls are for example uh I recently had an experience with voting each polling place is required to have an accessible voting machine that for law I'm\nBased on the help America vote act when I went to my polling place\nRequirement they didn't know that there was an accessible voting machine a yeah I've talked to other individuals and helps file complaints where they went to their polling place\nAnd an accessible boating machine was not available so that's one area I think also understanding or some of the other aspects of accommodations that people with disabilities\nAre are entitled to isn't port and in terms of education and poll workers so some of those might include the right to have someone assist them what's voting either responsibility to provide curbside voting ensure that that is available if a voter with a disability cannot enter the polling place\nOf course we hope that our polling places are accessible and that that's not an issue but unfortunately that's not the case and every polling place\nWell opportunity is to ensure that more people with disabilities are trained his poll workers I think that's one of the most promising options\nWill ... and a lot of polling places are in a county or municipal buildings which should already be accessible but some are in other types of buildings which may or not\nUh not be and so there's probably I Would guess across the state some inconsistency here do you have an idea of um of uh where we have more problems is that in cities in rural areas where where do we see the most issues here\nThat's a great question um disability rights Wisconsin works with\nThe Wisconsin election commission to address accessibility and the polling places than on a major elections including the one in November sex we actually will be going out I having trained members of our staff along with the\nWisconsin election commission and their staff going to audit polling places across the\nStates I'd love to come back and talk with the afterwards and share what we've learned\nI think historically that there may be additional barriers in rural areas voters may have a a longer\nTravel time to get to the polling place and there may be greater concern is about accessibility there but honestly we do see problems across the board\nWell let's hear from some citizens with disabilities in northern Wisconsin and the challenges they face this was put together as part of WPRI is beyond their Ballard project by reporter Daniel catering and features Richard skirt rich or John new sane and Steve Carlson talking about what they'd like to see addressed this election season\nRich or you're going to vote in this election this fall and why\nI Am going to vote in this election and this is one of the most important things that we do as citizens can you tell us why it's important for people with disabilities in particular to vote there's a lot of issues that reflect and affect\nPeople with disabilities and some of the examples that affect people with disabilities are um public transportation personal care assistance\nAnd accessibility in general employment opportunities health coverage and benefits for people with disabilities and what's the single most important issue to you in this election\nWell there's a lot of them so it's hard to say the single most important one but transportation transportation in northwestern Wisconsin is a really tough nut to crack there's very few places that have public transportation superiors wanted does have mainline in Paris transit\nAnybody else in Douglas County is going to have a really hard time finding a ride all the public kind of transportation that we can get will benefit all our citizens but in particular people with disabilities what would you say is an important issue in this election season for Medicaid expansion\nHere in Wisconsin is not only affected people with disabilities in terms of\nAn inability to expand our program crucial to keeping folks with disabilities independent in the community by the lack of the expansion has contributed to higher premiums for people buying policies on the open exchange\nHow do you think things have changed related to disability issues over time and the political arena\nI cut my teeth on disability rights with the Americans with Disabilities Act\nAnd ever since that time I think it put the issues of disability rights out there in front of everybody it was a wakeup call to America in my opinion that\nWe have to consider the concerns of people with disabilities before that it was really tough to get anybody to really care\nYou know um if it doesn't affect them and I'm the same way I mean it's human nature I was not affected by any disability stuff until something happened to me\nYou know I'm a I'm a single like a ... I was injured in construction accent when I was twenty four and when I woke up in the hospital I had some questions about am I going to be able to do the stuff\nA year later that was not the biggest concern I had in my life and it isn't today so um that disability experience teaches us\nThat you know this was just a naturally occurring thing it's always going to be with us it's always going to be with society and certainly nothing to be feared\nThere is a very fine line between people with disabilities and people in general where people first and it really is true the sooner or later everybody's grew disability murder lose your hearing that's going to be harder to walk around you might end up in a wheelchair with a tune\nDisability issues or people shoes\nI feel the root of all barriers is that stigma attached to disability it sounds like a simplistic answer but I think if we get past\nThat we can be inclusive and more inclusive to people [noise]\nBarber or respond to what we heard I mean there was a lot there but to give us your take on what we just listened to\nYeah well first of all kudos to our speakers I think they had a very important message and that is that um any one of us is likely to develop a disability in our lifetime it's uh the only minority group that anyone of us might join at any time and I think that's why we all have a stake\nIn ensuring that there is equal access to voting for voters with disabilities\nSo ... there were those these voters were talking about the conditions in northern Wisconsin let's talk about the unique challenges that rural voters space\n[laughter] well I think uh the comments by transportation are particularly relevant I can be a long distance to travel to the polling place and there is not the same access to public transportation that we have and some of the more urban areas of our state and that further reinforces\nWhy it's so important for\nPeople with disabilities and their family members and others who care\nAbout access to voting rights and to all of the um\nAll of the services in our community to get involved because the choices that people make at the ballot box habit direct impact on\nFuture access to transportation our policymakers will be making important decisions about policies that have an impact on those issues and that have the ability to transform the independence of people with disabilities\nRights Wisconsin and also serves as the coordinator for the help America vote act program do you have a disability what has your experience been at the polls have you face some challenges what accommodations or needed in order to ensure that you can vote what questions do you have about resources for voters with disabilities\nLet us know what eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four it's the morning show on the ideas that work on John ... and [noise]\nUm I had a number of issues\nThat challenge for me in voting has always been um having and accessible ballot um there is a is there are accessible voting machines a prior to the city of Madison having\nBetter technology there was a machine called the auto market and um when I Would get to my polling place\nI Would have to work through my own\nFeelings of not wanting to stand out um or feel different or feel less than by having to ask to use that piece of equipment and that piece of equipment and many polling places is often kind of shoved to the back of the polling place\nI used to be the auto mark was about eight hundred pound gorilla so it it took up a lot of space it was noticeable you clearly stood out as friends if you were using that piece of equipment versus one of the you know the the\nFor voters to fill out their ballot it often didn't work um the ink cartridges dry out in them so you know you go through the whole procedure of using it and then your ballot doesn't print so you kind of back at square one and then do you decide\nGosh I'll just live with filling out a paper ballot I'm seeing the paper ballot is always very difficult for me I'm I'm\nAble to do it with um a lot of effort um so I always if I filled out a paper ballot versus using the auto mark\nI had to bring 'em a magnifying glass and I would always let poll workers do that I had it because I didn't want them to think I was doing something weird you know at the uh when I was filling up my ballot\nUm and it would always take me longer because you know there's only a certain amount of the ballot you can see when you use a a really strong magnifying glass mom\nOr my other option was to ask my spouse to a complete the ballot with me and I'm In while my spouse is always very\nWilling to do that and very generous about it and I trust\nThis person to enter my information accurately there's still some thing uncomfortable about having someone else complete your ballot 'em and other other voters are noticing that you know it's like why is that person\nDoing this person's ballot so it's just a lot of 'em just comfort and and never quit you know I'd watch other voters come in\nAnd get two or three people wouldn't vote and the time that it would take me to vote so I always needed to build in time for um being able to complete my ballot and not feeling rushed through it\nBarbara comment on what you just heard from the news\nYeah well thank you Denise for such an import and calm and carry on voting rights I think it's important for everyone to understand that this is actually the law it's not just something that's nice to do\nThe help America vote act states that casting a ballot needs to be accessible for individuals with disabilities including non visual accessibility for those on\nBlind and visually impaired in a manner that provides the same\nOpportunity for access\nAnd participation as for other voters so while some good progress has been made as Denise points out we have a long way to go and ensuring that voters with disabilities are aware of their rights that poll workers are sufficiently trained and that that technology is both available\nAnd in good working order that's not always the case so\nWe got work to do together you know what about I mean a a Denise ... was talking about you know the the need not to have these things can be shoved dogs into a dark corner or be made to feel\nA difference or somehow it impeding the voting process for others um ah the way she was made to feel at the polling place to talk about what that's like\nI really think that a best practice is if poll workers\nAsk every voter when they come to the polling place would you like to have a paper ballot or use the accessible voting machine that way everyone is informed of this right and I've heard from a lot of people that\nThey've really appreciated that um you know I've talked to a voter who isn't able to do is not visually impaired but without her reading glasses has difficulty reading the ballots so she was really appreciative of the opportunity\nIt's a technology that many people can benefit from so I think that that's a best practice for our poll workers for what\nA combination specifically are available to voters would visual or hearing impairments we haven't talked about talked about the hearing impaired yet either\n[laughter] well I think that there are\nSeveral different accommodations for that are available first of all I'm the voting machine because of the fact that it provides the detail information on the screen is something that is um beneficial to many voters who have the
