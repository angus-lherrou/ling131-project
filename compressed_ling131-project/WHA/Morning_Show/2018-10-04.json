I. S. dot com and nominate literally anything that is made here in Wisconsin or as I said we got about a hundred and sixty nominees and those were from every corner of the state\nAnd once we got past that nomination period and got into September than we actually started the voting process\nSo let's define the term cool what do we mean by cool here\nOh I I mean if if you are if you look at a hundred and sixty nominees that we had this past year or ... there there are so many different things whether we're talking about um custom food carts that are built up in St germane Wisconsin a custom yachts that are built in manner to walk\nOr here in the in the Madison every one of our final is we have cc mood that makes medically adaptive clothing for for kids who need feeding tubes\nUm I mean there's so many cool things made across the state of Wisconsin a if you look to the past two years we had ... corporation one uh last year with their joint light tactical vehicle uh one of the military vehicles that they build for the uh for the military\nAnd then we had the year before a Harley Davidson and their Milwaukee eight engine for their motorcycles so are we really do make some cool things in Wisconsin\nWhat is the most unusual thing that\nI mean I I just was looking at some of this stuff and and I thought wow you know that's really I had no idea we were making that you\nKnow I [noise] you because there's a hundred and sixty is it's hard to really pick just one out um I Would say some of the the more interesting ones that I thought is we have a few folks in Wisconsin who are amazing metal fabricate hers\nUh there's some some really great art work and things that that are made um as I mentioned earlier those food trucks that are made up in St germane by a cage crow fabrication\nThey they take an old school buses old or a Winnebago trailers or anything like that and they make it introduced food trucks I think one that they're actually making right now is going off to New York\nTo help foster kids actually learn how to cook\nUm so it's a program that they're that they're doing out there and they're building the ah the the kitchen and it's a mobile kitchen for them\nBut also things that I had no idea um before we started this contest ah Philadelphia cream cheese is actually made in beaver dam Wisconsin and none of it's made in Philadelphia So I think there's a lot of uh a lot of things that maybe you don't really think about that you might use every day uh that was made right\nHere in the badger state the the world is full of irony [laughter] um uh the uh uh well and I noticed that ah they're ah it's not when we say that the definition of manufacturing may get\nA little bit of wiggle room here because there were baked goods there are ... there were a there was at least one beverage um and and so you know it it's not just something that you would make in a factory no\nWe're not just talking about on machinery or metal fabrication here I mean we really we really want to see what is the coolest thing made a here and and so uh one of our finalist is uncle makes bake shop uh they make a sea salt Carmel pecan ... uh they have a few locations up in the Green Bay area if you ever have a chance\nGo there and get some it's absolutely phenomenal a and you will not be disappointed\nBut also as you mentioned we had some other some other food and drink products out obviously a lot of breweries around Wisconsin that were involved in this contest and then we also had done Claire brunette a sparkling water they had a a new flavor ... cherry bury\nA which uh they were kind enough to drop off at the WAMC offices or over the last couple of weeks and it tastes really great uh and obviously a really good option if you're trying to get away from sowed a little bit um you know that's sparkling water has some some great flavor while Sarah\nHopeful one of our producers is is a big fan of the sparkling water so she was pretty excited to see that on the list as they should have brought a few over [laughter] and some of the criminal too\nAlthough I wouldn't have done me any good and superior but that's OK I'm trying to cut down on criminal so okay so uh this is um maybe a touchy question but being that it's Wisconsin for people who've never experienced this state pastry what is ...\nSo critical so there's there's actually a little bit of an argument here because uncle makes uh they they use a a a specific definition for single that may be different than our our uh folks who are down in there were seen area\nUm so so typical you have the the more oval shaped really thin pastry that has some some fruit or or or ... or ... or something on the on the inside with a little bit ...\nUncle Mike switches as I set up in the Green Bay area they actually they go all out they make it in a pretzel shape um and so that goes back to some of the more European style ... that um that were made a hundreds of years ago\nAnd it it's a little bit little bit bigger or has it has a little bit more I'm more a filling inside and some more frost and stuff so there's a little bit of a debate between between the folks who make creamed all on what is real Pringle but both of them are the are the state pastry\nOkay er and again you know I mean it's interesting that the bake shop became a finalist and so your definition of manufacturing is it's made in ...\nAnd we're you know we're looking to to folks all across the state I mean obviously we have we have a lot of um a food manufacturing that goes on in Wisconsin and so while uncle makes might be a a smaller company I'm you know they're they're obviously making\nA lot of green go up in the Green Bay area but also you can look to folks like sergeant Joe I'm over in Plymouth, Wisconsin\nUh they make they make a crazy amount of of cheese there ah in and out last year they were actually one of our um one of our top sixteen or with their balance the brakes which are um small little snack packs that you can have with cheese and nuts and some ... dried fruit\nAnd so you know there's there there's when you think of manufacturing there is so there is such a vibrancy and diversity out there in the state of Wisconsin\nAnd um it's really I mean we make so many different things that this is what this contest is all about\nWe're talking with Nick Novak the director of communication and marketing for Wisconsin manufacturers in Congress about the coolest thing made in Wisconsin or the or the next group we want to talk about it is a CC move El Al see Institute and tell us about this manufacture\nSo this is actually I'm just a really great story I'm about uh about a family who are they had um a newborn\nAnd realize that because of because of um some some medical issues that that he was born with\nA he was not able to to eat like like the rest of us would and needed a feeding tube and so one of the issues that you run into with a small child who needs a feeding tube is that you have to feed them every hour um you have to you have to put this to been to a small um area and they're in next to their stomach\nAnd ... you have to undress them to to get everything put together and if they're sleeping it really interrupts or sleeping pattern I'm so this family right out in stone and they um came up with this medically adaptive clothing it has a small little zipper right on the side of the ones he makes it so much easier that way they the kid can continue sleeping\nUm and and it's really helping a whole lot of families throughout the country um and uh and obviously helped out this family are quite a bit so we have been announcing each uh each round as we've been been going on we'd been announcing these are on the WAMC Facebook page on a via Facebook Live\nAnd our ... our our president you know he's ... he's been saying every single time they move on that that necessity is the mother of all invention and this is definitely true in this case and obviously a really great product that's helping a lot of families drought Wisconsin [noise]\nWhat are the what criteria do you need to meet in order to be entered into this competition so it it's a very simple contest ah we we really just asked that I'm\nA the product has made here um so so the the company doesn't need to be headquartered in Wisconsin but we do want to have the product that is that is nominated\nTo be physically made in the state of Wisconsin so um for instance John Deere which we'll talk about and just a second uh their their headquarters is is I'm not in the state of Wisconsin but\nThey have a great manufacturing presence here in Oregon um where they make the John ... or so on as long as the products made here uh you qualify for the contest [noise]\nOkay well we're going to continue would get to more items of the final four uh to uh to go here and we're going to continue this discussion and uh what do you think the coolest thing is uh made here in Wisconsin and have you voted in this\nContest ah I did um I'm not telling what I voted for but I did vote 'em you can do to if you choose to do so and we'll tell you how to do that and more as we continue our discussion here on the ideas network I'm John ... and this is the morning show [noise]\nWhat you're supposed to do if someone does ah go into cardiac arrest and there's an emergency situation so\nUh whether your or a kid or an adult and you can use it and it comes in in in multiple different languages and it's actually sold all around the world and so this is a this is a life saving product that has made right here in the state of Wisconsin and I'm just a a really great company I'm a you know ... with a with a high tech product\nThat uh we we um you know think is a a really great to have and I actually a little side note as a part of WAMC and are are WAMC foundation we have the Wisconsin safety council which does safety training and um then and sell safety products one of the products that they sell is actually the cardiac science corporation ADD\nUm sell for for manufacturers or other companies throughout the state if they're wanting to make sure that they're fully prepared for an emergency situation um they can make sure that they have these eighties on a you know on their promises a so in case anything ever goes wrong with one of their employees and you know they can be right there to to save their life\nOr maybe they could mount them on robots and then the robots could just you know take them around I don't know maybe a little far fetched I read way too much science fiction\nSo there we have the final four manufacturers have been chosen a after more than a hundred and fifty thousand votes had been cast of so what's the next step into competition\nSo we're coming right to the end here we are or were getting really excited on Tuesday we're going to announce a winter so actually for folks who want to see live who the who the winner

M. C. dot org if they want to get tickets to that to see who is the coolest thing making Wisconsin winter live\nA voting will end around noon so that's actually during the event and uh so I'm sure

pretty cool product also made right here in Wisconsin we're\nTalking with Nick Novak the director of communication and marketing for Wisconsin manufacturers in and Congress about the contest known as the ... what's the coolest thing made in Wisconsin we've identified the four finalists or you can you can go and vote\nAnd I am going to speak out of turn for our producers here and say that we put a

somebody else will take care of that will make it happen see that's what I Love about the crew here I'm so a lot lots of products were nominated not all of them made the cut obviously what are some other unique things made in Wisconsin that didn't make the cut this year\n[noise] well I think we we've talked about a quite a quite a few of them already um but uh you know just to name a few more uh we had a a a generator that is made by gender rack and walk a shot that actually a is a home generator why connected so if anything goes wrong\nOr it can automatically turn on and ensure your house is still um be empowered and you know if there's you know flooding or anything like we've recently had\nIt can make sure that your son thump is still running um you know so so that's obviously a really great product\nOr if you look over and in Milwaukee there's breaks in Stratton um they had a a lawnmower and some in some other products that they had submitted for the the contest this year\nUm I mean yeah there there are hundreds of things that that were nominated but the the ... this is just a small portion I mean if you go to made in West dot com or you'll be able to see all the nominees um will be putting those up there on the website shortly um now once we get to the final winner here\nBut the um the hundred and sixty nominees that's just a small portion of all the things that are made in Wisconsin we actually have about Ninety four hundred manufacturers all throughout the state so this contest could grow even more than just those a hundred and sixty nominees so hopefully next year we'll ... we'll get to see even more products\nWell if you'll divulge it what to you is one of the coolest things are made in Wisconsin [noise]\nWell I you know I have to stay a you know is impartial as possible here so I think uh all the nominees that were that were put together and now this is a non answer but ah all the products that are out there are a are really great\nUm I think our final four is a is a really strong final four they they each have their their their strengths and are obviously I'm completely different products when you look at them um you know I think ah you know I'm I

ag machine and and uh you know the criminals pretty good and that was the honeymoon had a great story and has a great products you know it's it's just really hard to choose so I guess we're gonna

things I'm a Wisconsin of course is has long been known for its manufacturing and uh tell us just how important manufacturing is to the states\nWill manufacturing made it ... is our heritage here in

I'm a\nTeacher I get the budget thing I understand you know you have clashed that has to be paid for it I just don't get into it and so I don't feel like additional building because he wanted to look like the other both eight it's fair to the voters then I'm not going to vote for that kind of thing\nOr do you think's a things for your call 'em a Jason ... is a ... sentiment typical and when we when we have a discussions about adding new buildings [noise]\nAlso I I think he is right that Oak Creek has I Believe a sixty one a million dollar referendum ballot obviously that's a significant amount of money it is one of the larger\nA referenda around the state although uh by no means the largest there are there are some that are even twice that size um obviously again I think we we we talked about this earlier that\nWhen a voter votes yes in a referenda that is um [noise] a vote to raise his or her own property taxes and as we also talked about and you\nKnow the case of recessions this that isn't purely a case of whether a voter wants to do that it's a case of whether he or she feels their financial able to do that so I mean obviously it's always a a high bar that school districts have to cross to have a referendum\nAnd succeed and that's one reason why it's interesting that are so many of them have in recent years\n[noise] [noise] well and I'm a I mean if you if we're talking about okay so property taxes might go up but ah the if the district is large enough that have been as large population\nThe the average uh increase for a homeowner wouldn't be like you know thousands of dollars for these referenda where were you know it's being spread over a quite a few people right\nAbsolutely yeah absolutely I mean and the the flip side of it is that you know public education is um obviously you know one of the most significant things along with public safety that\nThat local governments do and it's obviously of of great interest to voters it's also one of the it's also the\nLargest expense for state government in terms of what state government spends its money on aid to local school district so obviously you know there there's a push and openness and again we have seen you know so far this year\nI'm eighty five percent of the six ... six eighty five percent of the referenda\nThat were put forward in the spring or did pass and that was that was sixty three referenda that did pass so again it's it's by no means uncommon in today's environment to see a school referendum past\nIs that eighty five percent is that a higher is that a higher than average number or as\nHas that been your typical over the last four or five years [noise] um [noise] it\nHas been typical that in recent years more a school district referenda has passed I think it was roughly eighty percent in twenty sixteen which was that\nRecord 'em you know you certainly see going back to their periods with in um [noise]\n... you know there's periods around recession in the aftermath of recession where you see\nThe approval rates more like fifty percent and even significantly below fifty percent if you go back to like two thousand three ... so [noise] so yes I mean it is it eighty five percent is not\nCompletely uncommon compared to recent years but it's certainly different than what you would have seen Fifteen ... you know ten Fifteen Years ago\nLet's take another call Jerry is with us in lake meals Jerry good morning thanks for joining us\nThank you I'm Emily ... a total population of a slightly over six thousand people I Believe according to the roads have\nUm we already have a a little school and an elementary school that is not get paid for and now we have a referendum that once she um increase the um\nAcademic portion of the ... which is the ... but we also have um an expanded referendum on sports facilities all schools as far as the amenities\nAnd in ... states and the lighting et cetera et cetera according to the\nState journal this week\nWe're graduating kids that are less than forty two percent proficient in reading and writing um\nThere are so many elderly people in this community it cannot sustain this kind of increase on their property or their school tax\nStates how long are laws that are of exams to people if either over from school tax I think it's kind of things to get on the bandwagon\nOkay a jury we get a jury is a fine with a with a supporting things that are specifically about academics not so fond of supporting athletics\nAnd ... that's ah what are the objections that people generally have to referenda all of this time\nSo I think first stop her description of the two ballot questions in the er the the the two part ballot question in the lake mills area seems to be accurate in terms of building classroom additions costs seven million dollars and\nImproving outdoor athletic gear and so the cost two point five million or that that time the November sixth ballot there I'm\nAgain I'm this is something that is you know ... school districts are have to make their case\nOr voters has got to decide whether or not they agree with that and obviously we have seen in the legislature we we have seen some debate or about putting\nAdditional restrictions on a time place and manner if you will for school districts when they can hold referenda how if they have one that fails how quickly they you know how long they need to wait before they can come back and hold ... another referendum so\nObviously there's you know there's debate on these questions she did also mentioned um whether or not we could ... a senior citizens from paying school taxes\nAre I think you know anything is possible for the legislature I think there there might need to be a constitutional amendment in that regard because Wisconsin's\nA constitution tends to require um equal taxation and so\nIt can be tricky as a lawmaker to accomplish that\n[noise] All right Jerry thanks for your call uh some uh terms we use when talking about school funding may be unfamiliar to some people and I wanted to to get you to kind of defined these forests or what is the difference between recurring and non recurring when we talk about these uh school referendum\nSure a that's a good question so there there are three types of referendum and I didn't use the technical term that you just use up or we can do that now one is to one type is the issue debt and I think that's pretty straightforward you do a\nBuilding or renovation and you issue bonds and then you you use the\nThe money from the referendum to pay off the ... then there's a a non recurring\nType a referendum and that's where you you increase your operating budget for a limited period of time typically you know three four years something like that although when that period is over then you know sometimes school districts come back and and asked to renew that\nThat ... ah and then finally you have something called her occurring referendum which just means that it's a permanent increase in the operating budget and any of the property taxes that the the school district is seeking\nAnd a dead issue that so we talk about school bonding um that's where the the school district borrows um and how much can debts how much debt can districts issue without having a referendum\n[noise] sure I think it's about a billion dollars that they can do without you know in in general they can issue up to a million dollars\nAnd ... and uh when there's when do they have to pay that debt how soon how long can they hold that\nWell ... ... you know it depends on the terms of the bond issue buttons or you know that their long term you know this over over a period of many years so not not in like a ... not necessarily Thirty years I mean I think no chemical UC tend to Twenty years that time period um but it you know depending on the terms about\nSchool referenda are on the rise in Wisconsin according to a new study by the Wisconsin policy forum Jason Stein is a job with that group and is here to talk about the report\nOn what it means and we're here to talk with you as well it eight hundred six four to one two three four lots of callers and we will continue our discussion [noise]\nI'm John months and this was the morning show on the ideas network of WNPR [noise]\n[noise] [noise] they they could ask for an increase in their operating budget and they could use as\nPart of that increase or you know whatever part of that increase they wanted the school board to increase teacher salaries that would that would certainly be possible um you know and I think\nIn in typically\nThe ballot questions do include some description of what the money would be used for and then obviously\nAgain through the sources that I\n\nMean we lost Jason for just a moment we'll get him back very quickly or here's an email from Hannah in Steven's point Hannah writes I Am a teacher here or district has been differing maintenance for years to keep budgets in check\nOur school is a beautiful place to be an end as well kept but it has plumbing and a heating needs as with any home there are costs involved in owning a building\nAnd it's going to take a referendum to keep them an operational order a that's a pretty common theme or across the state buildings age and they need to be paid for and there's a lot of deferred maintenance in districts are as they try to tighten their budgets\nAre let's say in the meantime let's um\nLet's take a call from Michael in a Green Bay Michael you're on the air go ahead [noise]\nHi so my comment is any time that we can get power back to the voters I Would say for that but the reason that we have elected representatives that's just because the voters are not always on the topics as they should be and if we continue to put the voice\nOf how money aside in our school for the voices of voter I think it will be the beginning of the island\nFor the fun things to the public school system and as we hear a harder push for charter schools [noise] that's going to become\nThe new option and I do think that\nUm it's going to be beneficial for Wisconsin or any other states that goes that\nMichael thanks uh things for the call Jason [noise] yes I Am here okay harder to what what do you think about what Michael had to say that the the more referenda we have that's a sign that uh our public school systems are getting less and less healthy and\nUm it may lead to a it may be a kind of a slippery slope [noise] well I guess\nWhat I Would say is you know there's a lot of ways for for voters to weigh in and so they ... through their their local\nSchool board elections and their their local referenda that they can also weigh in in their you know that's not the only thing on the ballot ... fell also uh every voter in the states will will have a state assemblyman or woman on his or her ballot or many of them will have a state senator\nSupport for WPRI comes from explorer lacrosse hosting festivals year round including\nThe plane air between the blast painting festival and apple fast information on more things to do and see is that explorer lacrosse dot com\nYou know that's a that's the Democratic process\nUm let's just for a moment let's break down what schools are asking for on the ballot this year I Know there are lots and lots and lots of referenda out there can you break down kind of a what a kind of category how many are are requesting each thing\n[noise] sure so I mean I can give you a couple of things one I'm just generally are we are seeing a significant number of referenda in a suburban Milwaukee Madison area so\nYou know suburban Milwaukee we we mentioned do walk a shop in Oak Creek also ... walkie\nA walk a shop in Madison area Middleton cross plates but do the Oregon\nEdge or ten ... all those school districts have significant or referenda those those are all large referenda that include a asset issues which tend to be a ... at least\nImprove your number because that that number is is something that paid off over many years but approved all it was a it you know look bigger that number looks bigger regarding\nThe recurring or non recurring although those do add up over time of year also see around the state uh on Alaska ... land there dodge fill also having significant ... around there\nAnd then in terms of what they're being used for I'm\nRemodeling building can cite improvements ah I think forty at the request mentioned that\nTwenty four the requests mentioned safety and security improvements ah twenty eight mentioned maintaining facilities and then twelve of them mentioned maintaining programming educational programming current world\nSo that sort of mix of you know that's that's an example of the sorts of things that are actually on the ballot\nMhm the um uh\nInteresting lea enough and this uh this was taken from urban Milwaukee um there was somebody who had asked earlier about comparing what we spend an education to what we spend on prisons\nI'm as a prison population has exploded so the costs associated with the state's corrections system the state's been one point two billion on corrections services in twenty Seventeen which is more than the state spent on the U. W.\nUm in fact the state spends more tax dollars on corrections than any other purpose except K. twelve education and healthcare for people with low income so\nThe answer to that question whether we spend more on prisons than we do on a school districts would be a no we don't\nUh but it seems like it's a close run thing that was Karen from Cumberland who asked that question and we our crack research team here at WNPR found the answer ... question I I think\nWe spend about we spend about one point was Iliad in general you know state and income tax money on the prison system eat were I think we spend about six billion roughly in all our forms that state aid to\nK. twelve districts and then about another a billion dollars in state income tax money to the U. W. assistant ... that would give you kind of us a sense of scale\nYeah All right so uh we will continue this discussion I find it interesting that out of all these questions over a hundred only twelve of them are for maintain\nMean maybe we can touch on why that is a when we come back\nWe're talking about school a referendum being on the rise with Jason Stein research director for the Wisconsin policy forum which put together a report on this and with you you're listening to the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\n\nHere's a look at the w._b. our weather forecast windy this morning than a mix of clouds and son hides from the mid fifties to low sixties\nFriday mostly cloudy scattered showers and thunder storms possibly with some heavy rainfall late in the day hides from the mid fifties to low sixties tomorrow\nSaturday mostly cloudy with rain and thunderstorms possible throughout the day especially in the southern part of the state rainfall might be heavy in the morning I was from the upper fifties to the low sixties this is W.

he wants to move forward with it as soon as possible but right now the Senate or is reviewing the FBI report and the White House is pretty much standing by to see what ... are made from it\nSo the Judiciary Committee announced yesterday that it had received the FBI is report as you say senators are looking at it do we know anything about this for their background check that looked into the claims of sexual misconduct\nWell we know that the White House is a pretty confident um and\nThere was some concern the White House with more ... and perhaps they should have been a but they of course it made it clear that they were not a keeping the FBI from looking into a day investigation at that level that the agency desire um but uh\nThey have reached out to at least ten witnesses according to the White House um and uh it sounds like no one is corroborated so far uh Christine ... sports that counts\nA but more details about what the report or discover have not been made clear yet to press\nSo who's allowed to have access to the information from this investigation at this point\nBut right now we certainly know that the Senate Judiciary committee or would be able to have access and uh as far as other senators are looking at it it's not yet clear how many of them will be able to review it or this early but uh certainly information will be\nReally as you said to find the coolest thing that is made in Wisconsin and we've had so much fun with this contest there are so many different things that are made in the state of Wisconsin are I mean we really have a vibrant and amazing manufacturing sector in our state\nAnd we just want to get everyone from from superior to ... ah you know Milwaukee to plant ville just every single different part of our state we want to know you know what what's made there what are all these folks who work in manufacturing and in different industries making in our state\nAnd it's a really fun contest get people involved the all around Wisconsin\nAnd uh so far this year we've had over a hundred and fifty thousand votes we had about a hundred and sixty nominees\nAnd it's just been a a great contest and and um we again really really big thanks to Johnson financial group for helping us put this on\nSo how does the nomination process work\nSo we started all the way back in August actually reaching out to folks and trying to get them to a ... you know just say you know what what has made in your home town you know where do you work what do you make a ... or job\nAnd folks could go to made in W. I. S. dot com and nominate literally anything that has made here in Wisconsin\nOr as I said we got about a hundred and sixty nominees and those were from every corner of the state\nAnd once we got past that nomination period and got into September than we actually started the voting process\nSo ah let's define the term cool what do we mean by cool here all I I mean if if you are if you look at a hundred and sixty nominees that we had this past year or ... there there are so many different things whether we're talking about um custom food carts that are built up in ...\n... that are built in managed to walk\nOr here in the in the Madison every one of our final is we have seen the mood that makes medically adaptive clothing for for kids who need feeding tubes\nUm I mean there's so many cool things made across the state of Wisconsin a if you look to the past two years we had Osh Kosh corporation one uh last year with their joint light tactical vehicle uh one of the military vehicles that they built for the U.S or for the military\nAnd then we had the year before a Harley Davidson and their Milwaukee eight engine for their motorcycles so are we really do make some cool things in Wisconsin\n[noise] what is the most unusual thing that that you've seen nominated so far I mean I I just was looking at some of this stuff and and I thought wow you know that's really I had no idea we were making that\nYou know I have to because there's a hundred and six there is it's hard to really pick just one out um I I Would say some of the the more interesting ones that I thought is we have a few folks in Wisconsin who are amazing metal fabricating is\nA there's some some really great art work and things that that are made um as I mentioned earlier those food trucks that are made up in St germane by a caged crow fabrication\nThey they take an old school buses old a Winnebago trailers or anything like that and they make it into these food trucks I think one that they're actually making right now is going off to New York\nTo help foster kids actually learn how to cook\nUm so it's a program that they're that they're doing out there and they're building the or the the kitchen and it's a mobile kitchen for them but also things that I had no idea um before we started this contest ah Philadelphia cream cheese is actually made in beaver dam Wisconsin and none of it's made in Philadelphia So I think\nThere's a lot of uh a lot of things that maybe you don't really think about uh that you might use every day uh that was made right\nHere in the ... the the world is full of irony [laughter] um uh the uh uh well and I noticed that ah they're ah it's not when we say the the definition of manufacturing may get\nA little bit of wiggle room here because there were baked goods there are ... there were a there was at least one beverage um and and so you know it it's not just something that you would make in a factory\nNo we're not just talking about um machinery or metal fabrication here I mean we really we really want to see what is the coolest thing made a here and and so uh one of our finalist is uncle makes bake shop or they make a sea salt Carmel pecan ... uh they have a few locations up in the Green Bay area if you ever have a chance\nGo there and get some it's absolutely phenomenal a and you will not be disappointed\nBut also as you mentioned with some other some other food and drink products out obviously a lot of breweries around Wisconsin that were involved in this contest and then we also had dumb Claire brunette a sparkling water they had a a new flavor ... cherry bury\nA which uh they were kind enough to drop off at the WAMC offices or over the last couple of weeks and it tastes really great uh and obviously a really good option if you're trying to get away from sowed a little bit um you know that sparkling water has some some great flavor while Sarah\nHopeful one of our producers is a is a big fan of that sparkling water so she was pretty excited to see that on the list has should have brought a few over [laughter]\nAnd some of the critical to although wouldn't have done me any good in superior but that's OK I'm trying to cut down on criminal so okay so uh this is um maybe a touchy question but being that it's Wisconsin for people who've never experienced the state pastry what is ...\nSo critical so there's there's actually a little bit of an argument here because uncle makes uh they they use a a a specific definition for single that may be different than our our ah folks who are down in there were seen area um so so typically you have the the more oval shaped really thin pastry that has some some fruit or or or something\nWith a little bit ... uncle Mike switches as I set up in the Green Bay area they actually they go all out they make it in a pretzel shape um and so that goes back to some of the more European style ... that um that were made a hundreds of years ago\nAnd uh it it's a little bit little bit bigger or has it has a little bit more I'm more a filling inside and some more frost and soft so there's a little bit of a debate between between the folks who make creamed all on what is real criminal but both of them are the are the state pastry\nOkay er and again you know I mean it's interesting that the bake shop became a finalist and so your definition of manufacturing is it's made in Wisconsin then [noise] ... exactly and\nWe're you know we're looking to to folks all across the state I mean obviously we have we have a lot of 'em are food manufacturing that goes on in Wisconsin and so well uncle makes might be a a smaller company I'm you know they're they're obviously making\nA lot of critical up in the Green Bay area but also you can look to folks like sergeant Joe I'm over in Plymouth, Wisconsin\nOr they make they make a crazy amount of of cheese there ah in and out last year they were actually one of our um one of our top sixteen\nOr with their balance the brakes which are um small little snack packs that you can have with cheese and nuts and some for um dried fruit and so you know there's there there's when you think of manufacturing there is so there is such a vibrancy and diversity out there in the state of Wisconsin and um it it's really I mean we make so many different things this is what this contest is all about\nWe're talking with Nick Novak the director of communication and marketing for Wisconsin manufacturers in Congress about the coolest thing made in Wisconsin or the or the next group we want to talk about it is a CC move El Al ... and tell us about this manufacture\nSo this is actually I'm just a really great story I'm about uh about a family who uh had um a a newborn\nAnd realize that because of because of um some some medical issues that that he was born with\nA he was not able to to eat like like the rest of us would and needed a feeding tube and so one of the issues that you run into with a small child who needs a feeding tube is that you have to feed them every hour um you have to you have to put this to been to a small area and they're in next to their stomach\nAnd ... you have to undress them to to get everything put together and are sleeping really interrupts or sleeping pattern I'm so this family right out in stone and they um came up with this medically adaptive clothing it has a small little zipper right on the side of the ones he makes it so much easier that way they the kid can continue sleeping\nUm and and it's really helping a whole lot of families throughout the country um and uh and obviously helped out this family a quite a bit so we have been announcing each ... each round as we'd been been going on we'd been announcing these are on the WAMC Facebook page on a via Facebook Live\nAnd hurt by our president and CEO he's ... he's been saying every single time they move on that that and assessed that he is the mother of all invention and this is definitely true in this case and obviously a really great product that's helping a lot of families drop Wisconsin\n[noise] what are the what criteria do you need to meet in order to be entered into this competition\nSo it it's a very simple contest ah we we really just ask that I'm a the product has made here um so so the company doesn't need to be headquartered in Wisconsin but we do want to have the product that is that is nominated\nTo um be physically made in the state of Wisconsin so um for instance John Deere which we'll talk about and just a second uh their their headquarters is is I'm not in the state of Wisconsin but they have a great manufacturing presence here in ... where they make the John ... or so on as long as the products made here uh you qualify for the contest\n[noise] okay well we're going to continue we get to more\nUh to uh to go here and we're going to continue this discussion and uh what do you think the coolest thing is uh made here in Wisconsin and have you voted in this contest or I did um I'm not telling what I voted for but I did vote 'em you can do to if you will\nChoose to do so and will tell you how to do that and more as we continue our discussion here on the ideas network

you can use it and it comes in in in multiple different languages and it's actually sold all around the world and so this is a this is a life saving products that has made right here in the state of Wisconsin\nAnd I'm just a a really great company I'm a you know ... with a with a high tech product\nThat uh we we um you know think is a really great to have and\nI actually a little side note or as a part of WAMC and our WAMC foundation we have the Wisconsin safety council which does safety training and um and and sell safety products one of the products that they sell is actually the cardiac science corporation ADD\nI'm so for for manufacturers or other companies throughout the state if they're wanting to make sure that they're fully prepared for an emergency situation um they can make sure that they have these eighties on a you know on their premises so in case anything ever goes wrong with one of their employees and you know they can be right there to to save their life\nOr maybe they could mount them on robots and then the robots could just you know take them around I don't know maybe a little far fetched I read way too much science fiction so there we have the final four man you\nUh after more than a hundred and fifty thousand votes had been cast of so what's the next step into competition\nSo we're coming right to the end here we are we're getting really excited on
