P. R. dot org or you can tweet us at WNPR mornings Christian Miller is the associated recycler is a Wisconsin vice president and out a game of counties recycling coordinator Christine welcome to the morning show\nGood morning and thank you\nTalk to us about China's new standards for recycling what's changed\nWell in January of this year they had um put in as you had said at a very strict um rule hit a contamination levels that are allowed in any of that crap or recycled\nMaterials that are sent from anywhere in the world which are um no one can meet those standards um\nSell it had done as it halted all imports of our exports of our materials from the United states and to China's um recycling stream A L like\nWell what about other countries other than the ... what about other countries other than the United states\nUm well what has happened since\nThen other countries are except in on some of this material that China has fans so the Philippine um for instance are now heading to take some of our recyclables not sure if they have the infrastructure over there to handle these materials um so and maybe I'm looking at another\nHow good morning thank you John for having me\nSo I guess\nThe the big question here is does the food and Drug Administration the FDA have any sort of old Fishell definition for natural\nUm it does have an official definition but very limited just two flavors and colors\nUm with respect to a broader definition there is no definition um made by the FDA though the FDA um has been considering doing that for about three years now\nSo it's so ... essentially them what that means is that uh when it comes to natural the truth is just all we all agree on or something like that or disagree on a ... right\nAnd and the difficulty is and I think this is one of the difficulties that the FDA's facing is that um when you label a food and natural\nUm they can cover all different types of food and have different types of meaning to different types of people um what we've seen and um I I but with a gate cases involving it turned out to try out some food lawyer\nUm and food for law professor at Brooklyn law school I mean I Know and talking to my students\nUm some people think natural shirt pertain to um how the food is grown some people think that natural should also pertain to whether or not the the eat itself I'm as from a genetically modified organisms are than others GMO\nUm which is a hot topic of debate these days um whether what type of chemicals go into the food um the flavoring that goes into the food how the animals are treated it covers a wide array of different aspects of the food that eventually is ingested by us\nOkay so but when a when a food company decides it wants to put words natural or all natural on a product packaging or does the FDA make it jumped through any hoops first\n[noise] not really the only thing the FDA has um issued as informal guidance and I'll read it to you because I think it shows you that it um it lacks real clarity I'm so this is a um informal guidance that the FDA if issued on time natural on it said the\nNothing artificial or synthetic including all color additives regardless of tourists have been included and has been added\nTo a food that would not normally be expected that would not normally be expected to be in that food um it doesn't address production methods I'm used to pesticide\nAnimal treatment um irritation pastors ... and um and even the limited\nTerminology at the FDA has given us says it would not normally be expected to be in that food so what exactly that means is unclear and again it's only informal policy um that was um issue back in Nineteen Ninety One when the FDA took up the issue of ... potentially defining the term natural\nBut in fact punted on that because they have to rely so it's a very complex issue\nWhat kind of sounds like the term ah from has the legal perspective the term natural or it has almost the same clarity used the term pornography\nOr when we'll know when we see it I I yeah we've got a we've got callers who want to join us already as we expected we would looks good I'm a nominee were Raj is on the phone with those good morning thanks for joining the morning show\nHey good morning guys uh yeah thank you for giving me an opportunity yeah go ahead I yeah I was actually listening to kind of ... and then they I agree with uh the PBS or the cod are from a yard guy about oh is that in my experience I had\nSeen only I'm not sure that I'm not sure what I don't think so that he has brought by definition of what that might have\nSeen on the on fuel label especially like food and\nColor kind of stuff like you know Colorado State what color match color that depends on you know events on a side effects like mostly they want to be a ... like you know okay a lot of these are like and when you see bought them they looked at those and conditions and like small\nSo everything it like I mean like you know nowadays if I can pay it forward from twenty Thirty years back\nAnd now it's all about ... what we are using high speed\nChemicals even if I go ... if I pay for farmers market even they are providing the fame in order to get a quality so so on and get out or do you do that by Matt and all so that is no other options and all that is like my you know\nOkay ... thanks so much for your call on Michael ... right I I think\nWhat consumers really want is transparency and the difficulty with the term natural and actually a lot of um packaging and it doesn't have to be limited to the term natural but that's what we're discussing here today\nIs the lack of transparency um hopefully the FDA will step in and do something I'm back in November of two thousand Fifteen the FTA I'm\nAsked for public comment on whether or not should get involved in this area whether or not should um define the term natural and how it should define the term natural um to date it's I'm half out made a decision um it does not have\nTo make a decision I'm In fact one of the questions that had asked the public was whether or not should get involved in this area in the first place um but I think everybody would hopefully agree that more information to consumers more transparency to consumers is a much better thing\nSo what do we know about how consumers responded to the label natural on a on a food product\n... so it's interesting why the FDA um is potentially getting involved in this area um there were four citizens petitions I'm center the FDA I'm asking for it to get involved in one of those was actually by consumer union\nThat publishes Consumer Reports and that was a ... in June of two thousand four tang and it was actually a very informed citizens petition because it was based upon a survey\nOf 'em up I Believe a thousand people that consumer union had done and the results were very interesting though in that survey found that consumers who saw the term natural\nAssumed that it included sixty six presenting fought it had no artificial ingredients are colors and fifty five percent thought that there are no chemicals used during the processing and sixty four percent thought that there are no GMOs words used um consumer union based upon it survey\nCame to the conclusion that consumers are being misled into the by the term natural\nAnd actually it's a petition to the FDA has asked\nThe FDA to ban used the term natural\nWell I guess that is suggests to the natural ah no pun intended next question which is a it wouldn't even be possible for a mass food producer to meet those standards how do you produce something\nFor consumption by thousands or perhaps millions of people without using any chemicals are additives I don't know is that even is it even possible\nTotally depends on the type of food if we're talking about um certain foods that are fruit and vegetables\nUm and actually even packaged food there there is the standard out there and\nThat is organic um it is a defined standard um\nIt has to meet certain criteria and asking fact one of the things that the citizens petition from consumer union pointed out as a lot of consumers assume that natural um they quit with organic um so it is possible and and a lot of companies are doing it already with the organic standard\nWe're talking about uh the term natural when applied to food a class action lawsuit was recently filed against the company that makes it look cry which is a popular Brenda flavored carbonated water\nIt alleges that despite his all natural branding the water actually contains a number of artificial ingredients Michael is this a unique or are we seeing more people take issue with this kind of branding companies\nOr this suit is I'm not unique 'em by any stretch of imagination I'm back hundreds of lawsuits I'm challenging the term natural happening\nFiled in the last several years um and I expect this to continue um probably unless the FDA steps in and make some type of a rule making here\nOkay we are discussing the term natural with Michael ... a consumer protection laws litigator based in New York City when you see the words natural or all natural on a food label what does that say to you does that influence whether or not you buy their product you recently started maybe\nChecking your labels a little ... more closely before you buy certain things in the store and what led you to do that eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four our conversation with Michel race continues and we'd love it if you would join us\nEight hundred six four to one two three four\nI'm John months and you're listening to the morning show on the ideas network\n\n[noise] it's a tough area because there's a really um great deal of different opinions on it\nUm as I was mentioning earlier during the program um the FDA is now considering a making will making here um because it was in response to poor petitions and the poor petitions are\nActually very diverse I was talking about when the petitions was from consumer union which is the parent company that publishes Consumer Reports ...\nPoint out my ban on the term natural\nUm another petition was submitted by the grocery Manufacturers Association which is basically the Trade Organization that represents a lot of um food companies and retailers and they really focused on\nUm GMOs and their petition to the FDA is you should allow natural\nFoods to be called natural that come from GMO um seed or or um foods and then there's another petition done by Sara Lee um that really asked for a broad definition that term natural and another one from the sugar\nAssociation which does the same thing I'm so in response to petition the FDA's actually asked the public for a comment and that the questions that you have to have asked\nIs should we define the term natural um should we prohibit the term natural what types of food should be allowed to have the term\nNatural should they be single gradient foods or should they be um more complex food should take into account the processing of food how animals are treated if perhaps the food is derived from animals such as dairy or other types of uh animal dried food\nShould you take into consideration of fermentation irritation pastors Asian it's a very complicated area and I think the FDA's um\nIssue and deciding what to do [noise]\nMichael raises a consumer protection low litigator based in New York City or do the terms natural or all natural on food labels influence whether or not you buy the product\nLet us know at eight hundred six four to one two three four maybe recently started checking food labels before you buy certain things in the grocery store why why did you decide to make that change what what was it that caused you to say hey I Want to know what's in here\nWas it may be a health scare a documentary you watched a talk show you listen to 'em Wisconsin Public radio eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas WPRI out or\nYou can also tweet us at WNPR mornings so Michael gets the bottom line here he is from your perspective do you think we will ever see the FDA taking a a firm stand on the issue\nOf uh of natural in food labeling that we're talking about today\nIt's really hard to predict um it's been three years almost to the day on November ... first two thousand Fifteen when the FDA ask for a comment\nUm and it's not the first time they asked FDA's ad for comment on whether or not to make 'em a rule that area um it did the same thing back in Nineteen Ninety One and ultimately determine\nThat that it would not make a rule at the time because it was too complicated of an area that get involved in um I Hope the FDA does though um I think that this is an area that\nUm everybody would benefit if there was a definite rule um they buy the FDA that said I also want it to be a fair and transparent um process we're all\nStakeholders and certainly consumer interest are thought of um\nSo what's the response been when the MTA has called for comment you know what are people telling them do we know\nYes and and these are all on the ... website um there are thousands of public comment and they range all over the place but for the most part um it seems that people are upset when they find out that if their products and label natural but in fat\nContains um GMOs or has some type of highly processed I'm not that of being made or contain synthetic\nUm they're upset about that and don't want those type of um ingredients and their food\n... uh you you mentioned uh the whole arena of of organic and how we we got to that I mean the department of U.S Department of agriculture began to more clearly define what organic was could the FDA ended up following the path that the agriculture department found them\nThey could and that and that may be one the simplest solution is\nTo basically adopt a standard that is like the organic standard\nAnd the organic standard um covers a lot of the\nThe issues that we've been discussing it covers um how the food is um process on how it's grown how the animals are treated um the the use or lack of use of pesticides I think that's what people are looking for 'em when they see\nA food labeled as natural I think\nFor many people it I'm served as a substitute I'm organic\nLet's take another call before we go to break here bird is in ... good morning go ahead\nAnd if I call 'em I don't know about the term certified I ever ran a true of actors of oil um as a certified on it and I've asked what a certified and they don't have an answer to that [noise] and\nOn the front of the bag so um I mean it leads you to have a certified organic which are there's not you know I Want to give a shout out of certified and how do you find out what a certified\nBurt thanks for that call and Michael I'm going to ask you to hold your answer for just a moment here um well no actually no go ahead and answer this question of quickly because we're just about at a very\nShort so um I think at any definition for natural should be subject to a certification process um I'm not particularly aware of the product that bart's talking about 'em\nBut let's talk about certification in general because certified organic is something that we do see in fact why don't we do this let's hold that certification a question for just a moment and come back to it and when we return and we've got some other callers who want to join us you could be one of them at eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four we're talking about the terms natural\nOr all natural in food wondering what you think does that

mornings Kagan Kyle is an investigative reporter for USA Today network Wisconsin\nHis recent piece there explores why many high school seniors in Wisconsin aren't filling out FAFSA forms Keegan good morning welcome back to the morning show\nThanks for having me what to what made you look into this for\nThe\nFAFSA is us off in part of the college funding discussion and we've been working on a series of articles without a college costs and the rising debts that are paid and so we wanted to take a closer look at how often is doing at completed and the fast the as part of the national\nPush in recent years to improve completion rates\nSo if for some of those it well it's been a while since we've had to deal with the free application for federal student aid form or fashion or a I think I still have nightmares about it but they can you remind us what it what it entails\nSure it's it's very similar to completing their taxes in a way you know you're an income level you need sometimes have\nDocumentation to prove your residence and there are many other there are lots of questions that you need to answer that can possibly qualify you for financial aid I'm completing it can give you not only federal\nStudent aid a discounted loans or ... of it can also opened doors too\nCollege aid programs as well as individual University College aid programs as you are that can be down trees that form\nAnd generally is this an easy or difficult for him to fill out\nA the federal government says that it takes up to an hour to complete but that can depend a lot on what documents you have already available for some of the documents that you need like a tax forms or prefer residents can ... that come by and can slow down the process\nYou're investigation found that a majority of seniors that more than one hundred high schools in Wisconsin did not completed FAFSA form in the last applications cycle uh what do you see is the largest implications of that finding\nWell there have been studies by you W Madison researchers that show um schools that have low rates of assets completion tend to be schools with a higher number of low income families\nAnd that's really alarming because it could be that\nMany families that would qualify for college financial aid and art and are eligible for it or not receiving it because they aren't aren't applying for it on the other thing that alarming about this you know the United states study is that many how many schools high schools that have low asked completion rates\nAlso tend to have fewer numbers of conflict so families receiving less help to answer their questions about how to complete the forum and make sure that they're getting the money that they're eligible for\n... before we continue I Need to ask this is is this a form that can be filled out on line or do we still have to do the paper version\nPaper is also now even a mobile app um that you can do it on your phone to complete the fast that this has been part of the federal government's push to make it a lot easier because it's for a long time people have complained about the fast and how difficult it is\nYeah it was many pages long and I'm a I I always thought that the estimate of taking an hour to fill it out was optimistic but that was probably just me oh we're talking with Kagan Kyle investigative reporter for USA Today network Wisconsin are you a

what you were doing and\nDid your school district give you any help with the process a eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four may be tried in and

a leader is with us you know Claire leader good morning welcome to the morning show\nThat morning thanks for taking my call yeah go ahead\n[noise] how I had actually found out that far far from that guy was extremely complicated like you said you start nightmares and disappointment hearing some mining that\nThere are so many people did not fill it out she was awarded buried at all as far as federal ... there is no way she got to pay tuition ... without my help so that's my concern\nIs so many people that didn't throw it out why she awarded more federal law\nLeader thanks for the question that I had a great question so if you were people are filling out the loans or the paperwork and we're saying that people are leaving money on the table where does it go does it go to people who did fill it out or how does how does that work you can\nUm independent the federal government their program is usually depend on your ...\nI can get financial aid there is some state and institutional programs that are a little different where it's based on how many people applied to financial aid that that can weigh on the maximum\nOur minimum dollar amount that you can receive so it can vary a little bit from the type of financial aid program that you're applying to but I'm the state for the most common state program that uses the facet to apply for\nStudents can receive thousands of dollars in grants and money that they don't have to pay back\nTo help with their college financial aid or the help pay for college through the financial aid program\nLet's take a call an extra ... who joined us from Appleton Jess good morning\nMorning go ahead I was just calling a ... just to say that it's a very simple process I Am a student myself I'm In my uh mid thirties and I found it very simple sellout is actually my second time 'cause I got my associates I work for my bachelors and\nUm I did not come from a high income family I come from a very low income family added process was for me it was less than thirty minutes she just got it out of your information such as tax information and are you living situation and that's really it\nAdjusts a thanks so thanks for that call a Kagan or how common is a justice experience\nYeah I I think that that fits in with the federal government's estimate that it can take less than an hour um it also like he said depends on what documents you have kind of already at your disposal so if you are already familiar with your tax situation um then it can be a lot easier to fill out because\nA big part of it is estimating your income level\nAnd just as old enough not to a need to put in any of his parents information which uh you know for most high schoolers are if if mom and dad have actually own property a that's an issue there there are other things that make it less complicated if you really are on your own or when they drew\nBeckley yeah exactly I you know I think one of the challenges for getting a lot of high school is to complete it is that you know you need your parents help um versus an adult is kind of filling it out and and now I'm so that's always something to that conflict are working on his\nEncouraging parents to work with their students are they're encouraging students to work with their parents to fill out the fourth\nTime was an investigative reporter for USA Today network Wisconsin his recent piece there explores why many high school seniors in Wisconsin aren't filling out faster forms when we come back we'll continue our conversation and find out how Wisconsin compares with the rest of the country in this area it's a morning show on the ideas network on Johnson\nExpectations are when you're going to pay attention to get a loan that big late a government sponsored won it basically already aware that you have on the average around ... thousand five hundred dollars and and and it's\nKind of a little bit incrementally increased after that if you have multiple students in school but I Believe that I like to make something as as a way around twenty thousand dollars per family um you are not eligible for anything that's called the grand\nScheme of things so things for the ...\nYeah I'm not sure about the the dollar amount I'm just I'm not that familiar with them the one question I Would say is that the federal aid programs there are limits differ from state limits for college aid programs or institutional programs so they're there for sure some institutions that\nHave much higher limits then twenty thousand dollars where you can be eligible for thousands of dollars of aid but to be held to qualify for that you must complete the FAFSA as part of their application process so even though you might not be eligible for federal assistance\nIt still can be very important to complete the fast so in order to qualify for institutional or state system\nWhich is a good call next from Johnson in Madison Jocelyn good morning\nGood morning I Love your show by name um you know my name so I work at the University of Wisconsin as a financial advisor and I just want to say that Iran is college bowl Wisconsin which happens all over the state of Wisconsin where financial aid professionals and folks from all over comes to help families complete the financial aid application\nAnd I just encourage families up look it up one in Madison\nThat's happening tonight is that if high school from six to eight there is also going to be one at the Urban League um not college bowl Wisconsin but a scholarship date I'm helping students look for scholarships and also helping students complete the financial aid application and Saturdays at the Urban League from like nine to one\nOrange jumpsuit thanks for the call so you can talk about the role of volunteer groups here uh Jocelyn mentioned one called college go Wisconsin you mentioned that in your piece what kind of work are they doing\nYeah there are a group of volunteers financially advisors who traveled to high schools around the states and take questions from parents and students and they try to help them through the application process they will often host events at schools where families can sit down at a computer and have\nA financial advisor kind of guide them through it\nThey are so just more of like a a question and answer session and no one's parents go home they can complete the U.S has to form so that they can be tremendously helpful\nParticularly schools where ... are not financial aid experts or they just aren't very number there aren't a lot of counsellors to really help a lot of families with their questions and so these big events where a lot of families get together can be a great way to kind of elevate the community education\nWhat role to colleges and universities play here should they have a stake in alerting incoming students to the resources potentially available to them\nYet as some colleges are actively trying\nTo work to improve as to completion rates not only with the students who are applying to the institution but two schools across the state or countries so you'd have that\nAs soon as one there's homes colleges actors in North east Wisconsin that are sending their staff into high school and trying to help students applied to\nComplete the FAFSA form regardless of where they're applying to school the idea being that the more people that apply for financial aid as more people that are going to be able to pay for college\nAny plans to follow up on this reporting\nYeah we'd like to continue to follow the the fast to completion numbers in the future because there is a a push by college goes confidence and other organizations to prove rates and we'd like to track whether that is happening over time\nYou can ... an investigative reporter for

to Milwaukee's business community yesterday as he ... reports Republican attorney general Brad\nHow can morning thank you John for having me so\nI guess the the big question here is does the food and Drug Administration the FDA have any sort of old Fishell definition for natural [noise]\nUm it does have an official definition but very limited just two flavors and colors um with respect to a broader definition there is no definition\nUm made by the FDA though the FDA um has been considering doing that for about three years now\nSo it shows you essentially them what that means is that ah when it comes to natural the truth is just all we all agree on or something like that for disagree on a desert area right\nAnd and the difficulty is and I think this is one of the difficulties that the FDA's facing is that\nUm when you label a food and natural um they can cover all different types of food and have different types of meaning to different types of people um what we've seen and um I I but when they get cases involving the turnout try out some food lawyer\nUm and food for law professor at Brooklyn law school\nOn that I Know and talking to my students um some people think natural strip pertain to um how the food is grown some people think that natural shit I'm also pertain to whether or not they feed itself I'm as from a genetically modified organisms are another GMO\nUm which is a hot topic of debate these days um whether what type of chemicals go into the food um the flavoring that goes into this\nA wide array of different aspects of the food that eventually suggested by us\nOkay so but when a when a food company decides it wants to put the words natural or all natural on a product packaging or does the FDA make a jump through any hoops first\nNot really the only thing the FDA has um\nIssued as informal guidance and I'll read it to you because I think it shows you that it um it lacks real clarity I'm so this is the um informal guidance at the FDA is issued on the term natural on it says the FBI is considered the term natural to me that nothing artificial or synthetic\nIncluding all color additives regardless of tourists have been included and or has been added to a food that would not normally be expected\nThat would not normally be expected to be in that food\nUm it doesn't address production methods I'm used to pesticide animal treatment um irritation pastors ... and um and even the limited\nTerminology at the FDA has given us says it would not normally be expected to be in that food so what exactly that means is unclear and again it's only informal policy um that was um issue back in Nineteen Ninety One when the FDA\nTook up the issue of potentially defining the term natural but in fact punted on that because they have to rely so it's a very complex issue\nWhat kind of sounds like the term ah from has the legal perspective the term natural or it has almost the same clarity used the term pornography\nWhen ... when we see it I I yeah we've got a we've got callers who want to join us already as we expected we would let's go to my nominee were Raj is on the phone with those good morning thanks for joining the morning show\nGood morning guys uh yeah thank you for giving me an opportunity yeah go ahead I yeah I was actually listening to kind of of Asian and they I agree with the PBS are caught it from a yard guy about oh\n... has gotten my experience I had seen only I'm not sure that I'm not sure what I don't think so ... that would have seen on the on fuel label especially like ... and ... kind of stuff like you know Colorado State what color match color that depends on\nYou know events on the side effects like mostly they want to be a ... like you know okay all these like and when you see bought them they looked at those conditions in like small so everything it's like I mean like you know nowadays\nIf I can pay it forward from twenty Thirty years back and now it's all about ...\nWhat we are using high speed chemicals even if I go ... if I pay for farmers market even they are providing the fame in order to get a quality so so on and get dollar or do you do that by ... and all\nSo that is no other options and all that is like my you know OK\nRussia thanks so much for your call on Michael ... [noise]\nI I think what consumers really want is transparency and the difficulty with the term natural and actually a lot of um packaging and it doesn't have to be limited to the term natural but that's what we're discussing here today\nIs the lack of transparency um hopefully the FDA will step in and do something I'm back in November of two thousand Fifteen the FTA I'm\nAsked for public comment on whether or not should get involved in this area whether or not should um define the term natural and how it should define the term natural um to date it's I'm half not made a decision\nMake a decision I'm In fact one of the questions that it asked the public was whether or not should get involved in this area in the first place um but I think everybody would hopefully agree that more information to consumers more transparency to consumers is much better thing\nSo what do we know about how consumers respond to ah the label natural on a on a food product\nSure so it's interesting why the FDA I'm\nAs potentially getting involved in this area and they were forced that it's in the ... um sent to the FDA on asking for it to get involved in one of those was actually by consumer union I'm which I'm as the company that publishes Consumer Reports\nAnd that was a ... says petitions sent in June of two thousand four tang and it was actually a very informed citizens petition because it was based upon a survey of 'em up I Believe a thousand people that consumer union had done\nAnd the results were very interesting though and that survey found that consumers who saw the term natural assumed that it included sixty six presenting thought it had no artificial could answer colors and fifty five percent\nThought that there are no chemicals used during the processing and sixty four percent thought that there are no GMOs words used um consumer union based upon it survey\nCame to the conclusion that consumers are being misled and deceit by the term natural and actually it's a petition to the FDA had asked the FDA to ban you said the term natural\n[noise] well I guess that suggested the natural or no pun intended next question which is a it wouldn't even be possible for a mass food producer to meet those standards how do you produce something\nFor consumption by thousands perhaps millions of people without using any chemicals are additives I don't you know is that even is it even possible\nTo it depends on the type of food if we're talking about um certain foods that are\nFruit and vegetables um and actually even packaged food there is the standard out there and that is organic um it is a defined standard um it has to meet certain criteria\nAnd in fact one of the things that the citizens petition from consumer union pointed out as a lot of consumers assume that natural um they quit with organic um so it is possible and and a lot of companies are doing it already with the organic standards\nWere a talking about uh the term natural when applied to food a class action lawsuit was recently filed against the company that makes it look cry which is a popular Brenda flavored carbonated water\nIt alleges that despite his all natural branding the water actually contains a number of artificial ingredients Michael is the suit unique or are we seeing more people take issue with this kind of branding companies\n[noise] five is to it is I'm not unique 'em by any stretch the match nation I'm fat hundreds of law suits um challenging the term natural have been filed\nIn the last several years um and I expect this to continue um probably unless the FDA steps in and make some type of a rule making here\nBecause we are discussing the term natural with Michael ... of consumer protection laws litigator based in New York City when you see the words natural or all natural on food label what does that say to you does that influence whether or not you buy their product\nYou recently started may be checking your labels a little closer or more closely before you buy certain things in the store\nAnd what led you to do that eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one too\nWith Michael ... continues and we'd love it if you would join us eight hundred six four to one two three four\nI'm John ... and you're listening to the morning show on the ideas network [noise]\n\n[noise] it's a tough area because there's a really um great deal of\nDifferent opinions on it um as I was mentioning earlier during the program um the FDA is now considering I'm making rulemaking here um because it was in response to poor petitions and the poor protections are actually very diverse I was talking earlier about ... was from consumer\nUnion which is the parent company that publishes Consumer Reports and they've asked for an outright ban on the term natural\nUm another petition was submitted by the grocery Manufacturers Association which is basically the Trade Organization that represents a lot of um food companies and retailers\nAnd they really focused on um GMOs and their petition to the FDA is\nYou should allow natural foods to be called natural that\nCome from GMO um seed or or um foods and then there's another petition done by Sara Lee um that really asked for a broad definition that term natural and another one from the sugar association which does the same thing\nI'm so in response to these but\nLike for a comment and that the questions that you have to have asked is should we define the term natural\nUm should we prohibit the term natural what types of food should be allowed to have the term natural should they be single gradient foods or should they be um more complex food should take into account the processing of food\nHow animals are treated if perhaps the food is derived from animals such as dairy or other types of animal dried food should you take into consideration of fermentation irritation pastors Asian at the very complicated area\nAnd I think the FDA's I'm\nReally facing a difficult issue and deciding what to do [noise]\nMichael raises a consumer protection low litigator based in New York City or do the terms natural or all natural on food labels influence whether or not you buy the product\nLet us know at eight hundred six four to one two three four maybe recently started checking food labels before you buy certain things in the grocery store why why did you decide to make that change what what was it the cause you to say hey I Want to know what's in here\nWas it may be a health scare a documentary you watched a talk show you listen to on Wisconsin Public radio eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas WPRI out or\nYou can also tweet us at WNPR mornings so I'm Michael gets the bottom line here he is from your perspective do you think we will ever see the FDA taking a firm stand on the issue\nOf uh of natural in food labeling that we're talking about today\n[noise] it's really hard to predict um it's been three years almost to the day on November ... first two thousand Fifteen when the FDA ask for comment\nUm and it's not the first time they asked FDA's out for comment on whether or not to make 'em a rule that area um it did the same thing back in Nineteen Ninety One\nAnd ultimately determine that it would not make a rule at the time because it was too complicated of an area that get involved in\nUm I Hope the FDA does though um I think that this is an area that um everybody would benefit if there was a definite rule um stay by the FDA that said I also want it to be a fair and trans parent\nUm process we're all stakeholders and certainly consumer interest I thought of um\nSo what's the response been when the MTA has called for comment what are people telling them do we know\nYes and and these are all on the left have website um there are thousands of public comments and they range all over the place but for the most part um it seems that people are upset when they find out that if their products than label natural but in fact\nContain some GMOs or has some type of highly processed I'm not that of being made or contain synthetic um they're upset about that and don't want those type of um ingredients in their food\n... uh you you mentioned uh the whole arena of of organic and how we we got to that I mean the department of U.S Department of agriculture began to more clearly define what organic was could the FDA ended up following the path that the agriculture department found them\n[noise] they could and that and that may be one simple solutions is\nTo basically adopt a standard that is like the organic standard and the organic standard ... covers a lot of the the issues that we've been discussing Ted it covers um how the food is a process um how it's\nUm the the use or lack of use of pesticides I think that's what people are looking for 'em when they see a food labeled as natural I think for many people it's I'm served as a substitute for organic\nLet's take another call before we go to break here bird is in ... a good morning go ahead\nI call 'em I don't know about the term certified\nI ever ran a true of act of ... oil um as a certified on it and I've asked order certified and they don't have an answer to that and it also adds organic matter written on the front of a bag so I'm\nVery early age of ... certified organic which are there's not you know I Want to have a shower and out of certified and how do you find out what a certified for\nA a bird thanks for that call and Michael I'm going to ask you to hold your answer for just a moment here um well no actually no go ahead and answer this question a quickly because we're just about it or break shirt\nSo um I think at any definition for natural should be subject to a certification process um I'm not particularly aware of the product that bart's talking about 'em but\nLet's talk about certification in general because certified organic is something that we do see in fact why don't we do this let's hold that certification a question for just a moment and come back to it and when we return and we've got some other callers who want to join us you could be one of 'em at eight
