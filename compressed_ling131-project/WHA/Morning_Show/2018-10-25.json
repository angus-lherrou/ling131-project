professor in statistics at Washington University in St Louis she's also the author of the recent piece published before the lottery drawing in the conversation the mega millions jackpot is now more than one billion dollars\nWhere does all that lottery profit really go liberty thank you for joining us\nAnd willing\nTo win lotteries first started um ah what was the goal\nWell from those states away public with from the lottery Lenny used to the public education\nWhile it's just that we were sold the idea that he took on a lottery actually Wisconsin is very different than the states and actually all revenue goes to perfect actually for\nLess than ... curves is a little bit different story but in general most states they said well yeah but that's how the public how factual writing from public education\nSo how has that changed\nJennifer thank you for being with us\nGreat thank you for having me so what exactly is the Amber Alert\nSo that's a great question actually it was started in Nineteen Ninety six in memory of ... man who was abducted and murdered in Arlington, Texas and following that every state has since developed their own amber program and in Wisconsin\nAre program was created in April of two thousand three so we've had it around for quite some time\nAnd I'm amber is actually an acronym for America's missing broadcast emergency response to really highlight how we use the emergency alerting system to alert the public to help us locate the missing child\nSo it was created then to help find a to help find missing children how often has it been used in Wisconsin\nWe have had now a total of thirty five amber alerts and Wisconsin since the inception in two thousand three\nFoot or how do we um what the what are the criteria that are considered when deciding whether to issue an Amber Alert\n... that's a good question and they're they're very simple criteria the first is that the child\nIs age Seventeen or younger the second is that the child is in danger of death or serious bodily harm and the third is that there's enough information\nFor us to disseminate to the public that would assist in finding a child and the thing to remember I think that there's a sometimes I'm a maybe a misunderstanding that we have to have\nA a suspect description or we have to have a suspected vehicle in order to issue an Amber Alert and that's not true if we have enough descriptive information about the child to be able to disseminate to the public that what assistant and finding that child that third criteria is not\nAnd often times we have enough information about the child right because we're we're in touch with local law enforcement they've had a report of the missing child so we're going to have enough information about that child\nWill know the child at age Seventeen or younger so usually it's that third criteria in on making a determination if the child is in danger of death or great bodily harm that\nWill I'm off and determine whether or not we should the Amber Alert\nAnd they're\nYou mentioned a couple of them but what are some of the more common misconceptions about the Amber Alert\nOil I think it it really just comes down to that set criteria for whether the child is in danger of death or great bodily harm that um I think sometimes people believe that if a parent takes a child that there cannot\nBe an Amber Alert which is which is not true if we have information that we believe that that child is in danger or regardless of the person who took that child we will issue an Amber Alert\nSo it would take us through the process of uh of issuing an Amber Alert or how does it start how does the information flow or how does it get out to the public\nSo it really starts with local law enforcement reaching out to the Dane County public safety communication center once local law enforcement has\nMade a determination that they believe that they're missing child fit the criteria for an Amber Alert they will reach out to Dane County and then did county public safety communication center will reach out to the O. J. and we here at the division of criminal investigation have a supervisor on call twenty four seven\nThree sixty five to answer those calls and then we'll evaluate each case as it comes and it will evaluate that the facts and then we have a number of people who are involved in the issuance of the Amber Alert so that we can push out the ... and a number of different areas\nAs quickly as possible so that didn't county public safety communication center will send out the Amber Alert through the emergency alerting system and there's eight alerts that will go out for any Amber Alert one every thirty minutes for the first two hours and then every hour for the following three hours\nAnd then while Dane County is working on the emergency alert system\nI Will work with the national Center for missing and Exploited Children to issue the wireless emergency alerts and that's\nThat's called the ... the W. E. A. and that's the alert that we all get on our cell phones so everybody in the state would have gotten the wireless alert last week Monday when we issued dealer for a Jimmy cloth\nAnd while that's going on we have another person\nThrough our missing and exploited persons unit at the division of criminal investigation police working to send out\nThe Wisconsin crime alerts through our Wisconsin criminal or not work so a number of your listeners may already be uh subscribers to the Wisconsin criminal network and they would have gotten that\nNotification by email or text and then lastly we work with the Wisconsin department of transportation to ensure that the Amber Alert is placed on the digital highway signs and then the lottery will replace the Amber Alert on their terminals\nThroughout their uh their outlets that in Wisconsin and then I'm I'm Sorry actually there is one last person and that\nIs posting the missing child on our Amber Alert website which has Amber Alert Wisconsin dot org so as you can see we have a number of different people working on a single Amber Alert at the same time so we don't have\nOne person one group are within one agency working on all of those different parts because there's a lot of moving parts and we want to make sure that we get those notifications out\nYeah there's a lot of moving parts is I think most people would have no clue how that what goes on in the background uh Jennifer prices commander the Wisconsin department of justice child abduction response to human director of the ... division of criminal investigation\nThe Amber Alert uh Jennifer how do you determine whether to issue an Amber Alert regional your state wide\nIt's based on the factors in each particular case that we will consider things such as the place the child was last seen\nThe time since the child went missing until the time that we received the request for the Amber Alert a mode of transportation if we believe that the child is in a vehicle with with the individual or a if we don't know um we'll just we'll take all of those factors\nInto consideration and determining whether we issue in our region or multiple regions or state wide so\nFor example if we issue an Amber Alert in one or two off for example in R. E. S. alerting regions in Wisconsin and then as\nTime goes on and we still\nHave not located the child and we have reason to believe that the child is traveling through other parts of the state we can actually\nIncrease um those regions as we go through the alerting through those eight alerts that I previously described so that if we issue in a in a particular region that that doesn't mean that through the course of the eight alerts that we will only issue in those regions so\nEven though we issue an alert and they'll Claire region for example uh if if two hours go by and and we believe that the child is might be moving to other parts of the state will expand those regions as appropriate\n[noise] so what should someone do if they think they have information regarding an Amber Alert\nWell if they had information on an act of Amber Alert they should always call nine one one that's an emergency that needs to be addressed immediately if they believe that they see that child\nLocal law enforcement needs to be notified if they have information for example um on our and our current Amber Alert that they want to share they don't see the child\nThey don't see Jamie but they have information that might lead to us finding Jamie we have a tip the mind set up um if they have questions about the Amber Alert in general they can always call us at the Wisconsin department of justice and would be happy to answer those questions\nYou you mentioned no clear earlier and that may be think you know obviously Wisconsin has borders in most of those borders have freeways going across some uh uh is what happens when we believe that the missing child has gone out of state\nWell we have\nA cooperative relationship with the our boarding bordering states in our Amber Alert program so we have a mechanism set up that will be able to reach out to each one of our bordering states fairly quickly and be able to request an Amber Alert\nThrough those states if they go beyond our bordering states we have\nRelationships with law enforcement in each of those states as well where we can reach out and request that the issue an Amber Alert\nAnd so while we have our criteria that I had previous was\nPreviously described most states have criteria very similar however if we issue an Amber Alert in Wisconsin and we believe that the child has gone to another state it's not an automatic activation in another state each state\nWhat do you want to be done to protect land and water quality in the lake superior base and how do you want the community to be involved\nAlmost your story eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas of WNPR dot org ... on Twitter it's at WNPR mornings\nWhat to look to talk more about those extreme storms in the flooding we've seen hounded all of the displaced should have been impacted the lake and and what about the base in overall\nYeah shores so um you know for for those of us who live in Ashland in in the show on again bay area um you know it's it's not uncommon to see um after I started rather than a C the debate turned brown or read\n'em but after ... ... and that there are reasons for that um the the soil types that are in our in the Sean again they region are on a mixture of sand and clay and so they are very highly uh relatable to begin with and we're seeing still\nSeeing erosion effects from um the the logging\nCut cut over about you know that was about a hundred years ago were still recovering from that but we're still seeing some of those effects from that even today\nBut now with these with these extreme weather events where we're getting more frequent storms and and much more higher amounts of rain and shorter amount of time that's exacerbating those conditions and so\nOn particularly for us in a while in Bay and around the base killed peninsula we're seeing 'em\nYou know that they turn around and it's taking a lot longer for 'em that sediment to dissipate because there's just so much of it um the worst\nAre getting washed into the into the into the lake and so we're seeing a presence of\nHarmful algal blooms around um ... around the apostle islands which we didn't see before um and so it's those are those are a couple of examples of things that that have changed that we um we just haven't really had on our radar I'm\nIn the last few years but they're things that we need to learn more about\nAnd learn and tried to figure out what the effects are going to be in the long term and and how do we how do we help mitigate that\nHow do you adapt to the natural resource\n\nWell that's a that's a great question so [laughter] so there are I'm One of the\nOne of the things that is um we're finding very valuable particularly with with this symposium is that you know it's an opportunity to bring people together who are taking a look at this from all different angles and there's some really talented of researchers\nAnd people developing tools to help us with um what we're what we're calling on climate change adaptation so\nUm we we have a a presentation coming up today from with somebody from the northern Institute of applied climate science based out of ... in Michigan and they've developed some tools um to to help recommends a different types of applications to the Lance I'm with the changing landscape\nAnd so it's basically we have to sort of changed the framework um some of the practices that we've done\nA you know maybe ten Twenty years ago aren't necessarily going to be the things that were that works today um and so we're that's why you need to get together and try to figure out as a group you know what\nWhat what should we be doing and there's a lot um there's a lot of work that's helping guide us that way but there is still a lot that's on now and um but the only way that we're going to be able to tackle this is is through this collaborative effort\nAnd and what would success look like here [laughter]\nOh well I'm six that's I I mean I think some things for for us that we've been working with in a strong um day for a long time um is really trying to reduce that amount of sediment that's going into the bay\nUm but you know we would love to see the the bay last brown less frequently um but I think I think what's most important for us as we want to make sure that um we are we are hoping to protect\nUm protect our water quality and not only for the sake of the the eagles the system but for public health you know we want to see less each ...\nEach closures we want to see less I'll lose that could be harmful\nUm we wanna how um local managers or a local officials\nUm figure out how to\nUm make their infrastructure more more stable so that they're not having to deal with covert flowing out every time we get a big brain um so so there's more there's more implications than just\nUm than just the the ecological benefit of the lake but if if our success can also contribute to\nA public health benefits local government benefits local official benefits and citizen benefits ultimately um that's really what what we're going for\n... and we're we're going to talk of ... or conversation to to ... ... ... you you mentioned you mentioned the algae blooms a couple of times uh we're hearing more about the war and\n... eroding into the lake causing this why are these harmful in Windsor what can be done to prevent them\n\nWell I'm One of the reasons that they have the harmful is there are certain types of algae sexual\nOn TALK shows that Cody a dangerous for public health that somebody gets a ... ... the um the algae while they're swimming um they they only really sick um\nWhat we're seeing so far though I'm a preliminary research is that the algae the green algae blooms that was all um that have been popping up around\nI'm quite hope and started then that apostle islands area do not have those talk shows at this point but that doesn't all that\nUm that there is a potential for that in the future we will try to be proactive\nOkay well let's talk about how to prevent them in just a moment Valerie ... is a natural resources educator for the University of

a half day off and\nOr my boss says hey I Want to your other or if you're a or a place you know um yeah it's\nDefinitely a bad deal and our current governor has made it harder for the average person\n... thanks thanks for the call David Kennan\nRick makes a really important point and something that those of us who live and medicine or a larger city really often don't realize that is that in the in the rural areas\nAre open as Rick said only like one day a week or sometimes one day at the other week for limited hours\nAnd so while under state law an employer has to give you three hours of unpaid leave to go vote on election that's required by law that's important thing for our listeners to know that for you that your employer has to give you time off to work to go vote on election\nBut they're not required to give you time to go you know a get a new driver's license and then it happens to be those six hours while you're working like in ...\nAnd then it really is a burden on on voters and so this is a an\nImportant limitation on on people's ability to get that access to the voting as needing to have that voter id and how difficult it is to get that idea and in some parts of the state\nInfant Rick Rick lost his wallet so he's probably in the system as being someone with a valid driver's license would he be able to cast a provisional ballot and then prove who he is later\nYeah so you always can do that if you um are on the voter rolls and but you don't have the proper ID when you show up you can cast a provisional ballot and then provide evidence of that later but you have to do it pretty quick after the election and so\nI'm again the record probably stopped to take time off work or someone you know situation to go get that I'd be a shortly after the election but yes but visual ballot is always possible to do but then you do have to follow up to to prove that you actually have the proper identification\nMost polling places open around seven in the morning and there was supposed to be open until at least eight some stay open until nine and for some folks who are working full time getting kids to and from daycare doing anything else uh working like go I'm Rick our caller I'm that window of time might not be enough\nAnd as you mentioned ah more employers are are required to give people a time off to go vote but they don't get paid for that what about countries that make election day a national holiday meaning you don't have to work to do they see a higher turnout\nSo they're not too many\nCountries that actually have national holidays like Singapore and South Korea there you know a handful of them that that too\nBut as we mentioned before the very typical thing to do is to have elections on Sunday and in most countries you know there are fewer people anyway who have to work on Sunday then than during the week and so that that does seem to have a very positive impact turnout is having a voting on a Sunday\nDo you see that becoming an option for the United states\nWell let's talk about it every now and then and people do uh bring up also the idea of a national holiday for voting um but it's never gotten a lot of traction for whatever reason uh we seem to be stuck to the you know the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November and it\nIt really it could be changed us nothing you know and the constitutions that has to be on that day so it\nCould be how did how did we get to that whole first Tuesday after Monday thing anyway I mean I'm trying to imagine some people sitting around in the room saying gosh when should we vote oh I Know\nRight I Know I have no idea that I just I've never heard the story of how that actually got picked to be the the ... day but it uh it it is some is arbitrary and it definitely could be ...\nSo uh what about the fact that the election day is just that one day with extending the voting period help\nWill it it does and in fact we do have a lot of states now that have early voting and in fact in the twenty sixteen elections over a third of the American population about\nThirty four and a half percent um voted early either in person or add some teach about forty seven million people all the twenty four million by mail about twenty three million boating in person early and so that\nDefinitely makes it more convenient for voters now research has shown that you need to combine that with same day registration to really boost the turnout\nStimulating turnout and meaningful way but it does help to to have that easier access by having early voting which by the way we do have 'em in Wisconsin it varies from community to community of how acceptable it is but here in Madison you can go to any library right now during the opening hours early\nUp until a November ...\nDavid cannon is a professor of political science at the University of Madison and a member of the elections Research Center on campus oh what barriers to voting come up in urban areas of Wisconsin\nWell one of the the big ones um is this lack of access to public transportation but also voter id have had a disproportionate impact on urban populations 'cause it has a disproportionate impact on a minority voters\nAnd also on on college students because college students now uh the college regular college id for most kinds of campuses in the in the state don't work to vote you have to get a special i._d. that has a date on it when you're roll student um and so you it\nIt it also disproportionately affects the college students\nIt's safe to say that some Americans don't think their vote counts so uh how big a problem is that in one of those feelings come from\n[noise] yeah no it's ... that is something that you see regularly in the polls about anywhere from ten to Fifteen Percent of the people say that they don't vote because they don't think their vote will count 'em it\nThe meaning typically given to that a reason had been that people felt like oh well so many people are voting\nBy boat couldn't possibly be pivotal if they're you know more than a million people boating my vote doesn't matter just in that literal sense like you wouldn't change the outcome of the election show up and some mathematical sense that's true but if everyone thought that way then nobody would vote and so\nUh that's never been a very compelling reason to vote but now there's some evidence also that some people who are giving that answer on surveys are worried that for voters security reasons like your electric that's going to the databases will be hacked and your vote will be changed and\nThat's that's why your vote won't count and there is increasing concern right now over election security and there's no doubt that\nThat we need some substantial work to\nTo beef up the security of our election system\nBut that again is not a reason not to vote we just need to improve the security of our elections and in Wisconsin again we have a very secure system because it's so decentralized\nAll right David cannon thank you so much for joining us this morning of good to be with you David Kennedy who's a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a member of the elections Research Center on campus It's MORNING show on the ideas network [noise]\nRight after that they'll ask you why you feel you must wear it assuming it's a symbol of oppression uh what's your response to people who think that\nI'm happy that they asked the question then do an Oscar tool ah because\nObviously if you've grown up in a town while you have an ever met will come across the Muslim before and your life I don't\nExpect people to have those kind of on says especially when the only thing that's shoved down their throats it's is negative I'm Around the whole job and Muslim women\nSo for me this this is my way of liberation this is my expression of liberation because I have I have made the choice to wear a hit job no one in my family aside from my mom actually was a hit job and that in itself just my past will story I feel as an example of liberation and self expression\nSo I think it's good that people do off those questions so that we cannot sue them\nDo feel like you've helped open the door for other job wearing models\nYeah [laughter] I mean it's not just me and this is definitely a um it's a collective of us that the whole fashion modus fashion movement has been going on way before the Haitian em campaign but I think\nIt was just post that way really came to life a lot of it was kind of its own bubble that existed but the mainstream hadn't picked up on it yet so that's definitely made an impact\nWell let's let's talk about the concept of modest fashion for those who don't know please explain what it is\nIt's so subjective it's it's modest fashion to everyone could mean something different based on where you're from for me I I was a hit job which is a a religious obligation I Choose to ... and I'm\n... I mean I I Know it sounds ... on the country like a religious obligation but then the day we will have we will have that freedom as to whether we want to I'm at ... and not so I I Choose to wear the hijab\nAnd so what does fashion then connect to my faith as a Muslim woman who was a hit job for someone else who is not necessarily a believing woman and any faith she could still choose to dress modus just because of of personal choice\nWhat impact you think you've had in terms of awareness of of the idea of modest fashion\nI oh I like to think there's been a lot of impact a I'm here in America so it is it is that it is a big thing when you're you're able to be able to travel and tell you a story to Seventy different parts of the wild and meet so many different people so I think yeah there's definitely been an impact well\nWhat does it feel like to have that responsibility to be kind of their face and voice for the concept of modest veteran\nIt's a it's a good responsibility because it's\nIt's nice to me being myself I'm not putting on an ax I'm not you know this is not it's not like a a something that I have part time job with and then I have my other life like this is me all round so I I'm just happy that I can be myself entirely in my career in my past life so yeah\nWork with human care Syria or explain their women's hygiene and sanitation projects\nSo he's been casts area that I'm\nThat ice is attracting specifically targeted at um Syrian people and one of the campaigns they had was for women and sanitation ... which is\nBasically encouraging people to understand that\nWhen they're all these kinds of situations that happen in war torn countries that it's not just about keeping people alive that human beings just like us and\nA lot of Syrian people they lived a very very similar lifestyle to us that Syria was not a deprived country and for them to go from driving to literally just trying to survive wet encouraging people that women\nNeed basic necessities that we take for granted toothpaste toothbrushes\nUm Senate she tells you know uh\nAll sorts of things that just simple and basic but they do actually have access to them and that's what the whole the whole campaign has about\n... video this week you have speaking engagements at a pair of University of Wisconsin schools here in Wisconsin Steven Steven's point of view W Osh Kosh how was your experience been in Wisconsin how people here responded to your story\nReally positively actually came I came here last year as well so everyone's like oh my God you you've been to Wisconsin twice and I'm like yeah and then on purpose [laughter] ... exactly [laughter] yeah I've already seen more of the state than a lot of people that live here and you know I've I've had a positive experience both times I've never had any issues um\nYeah people are really friendly so much as as much of that there is this kind of a idea that Wisconsin's very white and you know they're very conservative it's like yeah they all but that I've I've had positive experiences both times\nWhat's next for Maria ... what are you planning to do next\nMy whole my whole movement right now aside from what is fashion is to bring representation in all areas of media so I'm working on a film right now I'm like I said in fashion I feel like the the the the ship is sailing positively so for me it's about including positive representations through film on telling our stories\nMaria ... is the first job wearing fashion model to be featured in a global campaign she was also a speaker on women's

goal\nFrom the state LA public ... for\nAll that lottery Lenny you get from public education\nWhile it's just that we were sold the idea that eight and a lottery actually with current and former you get for that in the face and actually all goes to ... ... ... ... ... a little bit different story but in general as a result of how the public\nHow our children from public education\nSo how has that changed\nWell you know interest theory inherited in fact it is true that it for stuff like education but the tricky part and the part\nJennifer thank you for being with us\nFree thank you for having me\nSo what exactly is the Amber Alert\nThat's a great question it actually it was started in Nineteen Ninety six in memory of ... who was abducted and murdered in Arlington, Texas and following that every state has since developed their\nOwn amber program and in Wisconsin are program was created in April of two thousand three so we've had it around for quite some time and I'm amber is actually an acronym for America's methane that broadcast emergency response to really highlight how\nWe use the emergency alert system ... the public to help us locate the child\nSo it was created in to help find or to help find missing children how often has it been used in Wisconsin\nWe have had now a total of thirty five amber alerts and Wisconsin since the inception in two thousand three\nFoot or how do we um what the what are the criteria that are considered when deciding whether to issue an Amber Alert\n... that's a good question and they're they're very simple criteria the first is that the child has aged Seventeen or younger\nThe second is that the child is in danger of death or serious bodily harm and the third is that there's enough information for us to disseminate to the public that would assist and finding the child and the thing to remember I think that there's a\nSometimes a medium is understanding that we have to have a a suspect description or we have to have a suspected vehicle in order to issue an Amber Alert and that's not true\nThe child to be able to disseminate to the public\nThat would assistant and finding that child that third criteria is Matt and often times\nWe have enough information about the child right because we're we're in touch with local law enforcement\nThey've had a report of the missing child so we're gonna have enough information about that child will know the child has aged Seventeen or younger so usually it's that third criteria and I'm making a determination if the child is in danger of death or great bodily harm that will I'm often determine whether or not we issue the Amber Alert\nAnd there are what are some of the more common you mentioned a couple of them but what are some of the more common misconceptions about the Amber Alert\nOil I think it it really just comes down to that set criteria for whether the child is in danger of death or great bodily harm that um I think\nSometimes people believe that if a parrot takes a child that there cannot be an Amber Alert which is which is not true if we have information that we believe that that child is endanger\nA regardless of the person who took that child we will issue an Amber Alert\nSo it would take us through the process of uh of issuing an Amber Alert or how does it start how does the information flow or how does it get out to the public\nSo it really starts with local law enforcement reaching\nOut to the ... public safety communications center once local law enforcement has that made a determination that they believe that they're missing child fit the criteria for an Amber Alert they will reach out to Dane County and then dad county public safety communication center will reach out to the OJ and we're here at\nThe division of criminal investigation have a supervisor on call twenty four seven\nThree sixty five to answer those calls and then we'll evaluate each case as it comes and will evaluate that the facts and then we have a number of people who are involved in the issuance of the Amber Alert so that we can push out the alerting and a number of different areas\nAs quickly as possible so that didn't county public safety communication center will send out the Amber Alert through the emergency alerting system and there's eight alerts that will go out for any Amber Alert one every thirty minutes for the first two hours and then every hour for the following three hours\nAnd then while Dane County as working on the emergency alert system\nI Will work with the national Center for missing and Exploited Children to issue the wireless emergency alert and that's\nThat's called the ... the W. E. A. and that's the alert that we all get on our cell phones so everybody in the state would have gotten the wireless alert last week Monday when we issued dealer for a gym and cost and while that's going on we have another person\nThrough our I'm missing and exploited persons unit at ah the division of criminal investigation\nWho is working to send out the Wisconsin crime alerts through our Wisconsin criminal or not work so a number of your listeners may already be uh subscribers to the Wisconsin criminal network and they would have gotten that\nNotification by email or text\nAnd then lastly we work with the Wisconsin department of transportation to ensure that the Amber Alert is placed on the digital highway signs and then the lottery will replace the Amber Alert on their terminals throughout their uh\nTheir outlets in Wisconsin and then I'm I'm Sorry actually there is one last portion and that is\nWebsite which has Amber Alert Wisconsin dot org so as you can see we have a number of different people working on a single Amber Alert at the same time so we don't have one person one group are within one agency working on all of those different parts because there's a lot of\nMoving parts and we want to make sure that we get those notifications out\nYeah there's a lot of moving parts is I I think most people would have no clue how to what goes on in the background uh Jennifer prices commander the Wisconsin department of justice child abduction response to human director of the ... division of criminal investigation special operations bureau we're talking about the Amber Alert\nOr Jennifer how do you determine whether to issue an Amber Alert regional your state wide\nIt's based on the factors in each particular case that we will consider things such as the place the child was last seen\nThe time since the child went missing\nUntil the time that we received the requests for the Amber Alert\nA mode of transportation if we believe that the child is in a vehicle with with the individual or a if we don't know um we'll just we'll take all of those factors into consideration and determining whether we issue in our region or\nMultiple regions or state wide so for example if we issue an Amber Alert\nIn one or two\nOff for example in R. E. S. alerting regions in Wisconsin and then as time goes on and we still have not located the child and we have reason to believe that the child is traveling through other parts of the state we can actually increase\nUm those regions as we go through the alerting through those eight alerts that I previously described so that if we issue in a in a particular region that that doesn't mean that through the course of the eight alerts that we will only issue in those regions\nSo even though we issue and alert and\nThey'll Claire region for example uh if if two hours go by and and we believe that the child is might be moving to other parts of the state will expand those regions as appropriate\n[noise] so what should someone do if they think they have information regarding an Amber Alert\nWell if they had information on an act of Amber Alert they should always call nine one one that's an emergency that needs to be addressed immediately if they believe that they see that child\nLocal law enforcement needs to be notified if they have information for example um on our and our current Amber Alert that they want to share they don't see the child they don't see Jamie but they have information that might lead to us finding Jeannie we have a tip line set up\nUm if they have questions about the Amber Alert in general they can always call us at the Wisconsin department of justice and would be happy to answer those questions\nYou you mentioned no clear earlier and that may be think you know obviously Wisconsin has borders and most of those borders our freeways going across some uh uh is uh what happens when we believe the missing child has gone out of state\nWell we have a cooperative relationship with the our boarding bordering states in our Amber Alert program so we have a mechanism set up that will be able to reach out to each one of our bordering states fairly quickly and be able to\nRequest an Amber Alert through those states if they go beyond our bordering states we have\nRelationships with law enforcement in each of those states as well or we can reach out and request that the issue an Amber Alert\nHave our criteria that I had previously previously described lowest states have criteria very similar however if we issue an Amber Alert in Wisconsin and we believe that the child is going to another state it's not an automatic activation in another state each state\nHas their own Amber Alert programs and they're all criteria that while they're similar or it may not qualify for an Amber Alert and\nWhat do you want to be done to protect land and water quality in the spirit base and how do you want the community to be involved almost your story eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas of WNPR dot org ... on Twitter it's\nAt WNPR mornings\nWhat to what to talk some more about those extreme storms in the flooding we've seen a hounded all of the displaced sediment impact the lake and and what about the base in overall\nYeah shores so um you know for for those of us who live in Ashland in in the show I'm again bay area um you know it's it's not uncommon to see um after I started rather than a said the debate turned brown or read\n'em but after ... ... and that there are reasons for that um the the soil types that are in our in the Sean again they region are on a mixture of sand and clay and so they are very highly a road of all to begin with and we're seeing still seeing uh\n... a cut over about you know that was about a hundred years ago were still recovering from that but we're still seeing some of those effects from that even today\nBut now with these with these extreme weather events where we are getting more frequent storms and and much more higher amounts of rain and shorter amounts of time that's exacerbating those conditions and so on particularly for us and Schwab in may and around the base killed peninsula we're seeing 'em\nYou know that they turn around and it's taking a lot longer for 'em that sediment to dissipate because there's just so much of it\nUm we're seeing a nutrients that are getting washed into the into the into the lake and so we're seeing 'em presence of\nHarmful algal blooms around um ... around the apostle islands which we didn't see before\nUm and so it's those are those are a couple of examples of things that that have changed that we um we just haven't really had on our radar I'm In the last few years but they're things that we need to learn more about\nAnd learn and tried to figure out what the effects are going to be in the long term and and how do we how do we help mitigate that\nHow do you adapt to the natural resource [noise]\n[noise] well that's a good that's a great question so [laughter] so there are I'm One of the\nOne of the things that is um we're finding very valuable particularly with with this symposium is that you know it's an opportunity to bring people together who are taking a look at this from all different angles and there are some really talented a researchers\nAnd people developing tools to help us with um what we're what we're calling on climate change adaptation so\nUm we we have a a presentation coming up today from with somebody from the northern Institute of applied climate science based out of ... in Michigan and they've developed some tools um to to help recommends a different types of applications to the Lance I'm with the changing landscape\nAnd so it's basically we have to sort of changed the framework um some of the practices that we've done\nA you know maybe ten Twenty years ago aren't necessarily going to be the things that were that works today um and so we're that's why we need to get together and try to figure out as a group you know what\nWhat what should we be doing and there's a lot um there's a lot of work that's helping guide us that way but there is still a lot that's on now is and um but the only way that we are going to be able to tackle this is is through this collaborative effort\nAnd in ... here [laughter] [noise]\nWell I'm six that's I mean I think some things for for us that we've been working with ... for a long time um is really trying to reduce that amount of sediment that's going into the bay\nUm but you know we would love to see the the bay last brown less frequently\nUm but I think I think what's most important for us as we want to make sure that um we are we are hoping to protect um protect our water quality and not only for the sake of the ecosystem but for public health\nYou know we want to see less each ... each closures we want to see less I'll lose that could be harmful\nUm we want to halt um local managers or a local officials um figure out how to um make their infrastructure more more stable so that they're not\nEvery time we get a big brain um sell so there's more there's more of Haitians and yet I'm than just the the ecological benefit of the lake but if if our success and also contribute to\nA public health benefits local government benefits local official benefits citizen benefits ultimately I'm not really what what we're going for\nAn end we're we're going to talk of but all of that stuff as as our conversation continues a Valerie ...\nYou you mentioned you mentioned algae blooms a couple of times ah we're hearing more about that was ... and the nutrients are eroding into the lake causing this why are these harmful in when what can be done to prevent them\n\nWell I'm One of the reasons that they can be harmful is there are certain types of algae that contain toxins that Katie I'm dangerous for public health that somebody gets in a you know into the um the algae while they're swimming um they they can be really toxic on\nWhat we're seeing so far though um the preliminary research is that the algae the green algae blooms that we're seeing 'em that have been popping up around um Cora ... then that apostle islands area do not ... top phones at this point but that doesn't all that\nUm that there isn't a potential for that in the future we will try to be proactive\nOkay well let's talk about how to prevent them in just a moment Valerie ... is
