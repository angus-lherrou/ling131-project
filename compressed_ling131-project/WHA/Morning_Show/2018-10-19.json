to ...\nUh there is one of the most games here in the end um but uh the Dodgers are really good they've got a hall of fame future hall of fame pitcher in Cleveland curse shot who are in game five

changed his recollections out so it's a long time coming\nAnd I suppose there is some competition to see who can grow the biggest one\nOh of course yes yes yes yes so basically I started at a in a ... it's all started in a tavern okay you know how to tavern and\nBoy that's a that's a Wisconsin thing this all started in a tavern\nStarted to have it\nWell they had a contest and and all of a sudden we were at a birthday party and and they ... they had it on a on a blanket they carry the four hundred pounds punk and through the door as my wife had actually got started and she says I'm a role in bigger than those boys OK and uh that's that's what started this crazy process okay it's an addiction\nSo so we're probably ten years ago okay\nSo when we talk about giant pumpkins or how big are we talking you mentioned one that was a four hundred pounds that went through a tavern door what what's the average giant pumpkin these days\nWith the average\nWell I just tell you what the Wisconsin state record is right now okay it's over it's over a con okay it's twenty two hundred and eighty three I'm okay that's how you learn\nHow to even get that out of the field\n[laughter] yeah that's that is getting to be a trick okay so lead use what we call lifting ring and the uh the straps that go down in the bottom so it's like a lifting ring that looks like a like a like a wheel off of a tractor okay and we ah we run\nSix strapped for eight straps down to the bottom with with raising the bottom and then you run it looked around the bottom and that's how you pick up and move that\nThey're getting any challenging the move I tell you that got\nTo have a pretty big machine to lift that much also I Would think\nIt takes a good transmission yes\nYeah uh what Fridays ah do people turn to to grow giant pumpkins\nFounded the varieties were growing up as a bills that lactic giants okay they were um um basically bred up in the north east northeastern Canada area up in a you know the Providence states up there and what they call them light decreasing up in that area\nThe maritime and a new mayor times yeah up in the mirror times yes\nAnd people think that they they do better in the hot or whether it was no they don't they do better what we call a\nSixty five at night and eighty five during the day that's Wisconsin has that kind of matter and we do very well and the growing\nGlenn Martin is a member of the board of directors of the Wisconsin giant pumpkin growers are our pumpkins part of your family's fall activities where do you go to get them and how do you use them eight hundred\nThree four tell us your pumpkin story eight hundred six four to one two three four did you grow giant pumpkins\nAnd how big was your giant pumpkin this year eight hundred six four to one two three four so a Glenn it tell us what goes into growing a giant pumpkin as opposed to just growing the regular kind how do you get it to keep growing\nFor the whole trick is that all of a sudden a we control the growth took a plant just like your permanent apple tree but you got to remember this is fast paced these is a plant grow up to six inches to a foot a day okay the vines grow stairs\nAnd the punk and growth can be upwards of fifty pounds a day okay then to explain that to problems in our K ... but it is what it is at least stardom indoors in April and then a a\nMid April mid to late April and then create a little mini greenhouse at the beginning of the season but she got ... got to vent them during the day to get very warm\nAnd then the pumpkin ... Senate every leaf that's the whole trip to growing up is to get them to learning at every leaf okay and now there's there's a lot of things that happen at every leap okay that we have a flower you have a lead to have you have a rut so you've got to figure out how to get them to go down\nAnd then you got to figure out how to properly feed him like he needed Trish into a new nutrition too and they're also how much water uh that's\nThe whole trick to grow in them and and and the other one is to keep the predators way you've got lots of predators that want this or insects animals to people that get in your garden and stepping among area\nOh no [laughter] not as well so this this hobby is this hobby starting to sound like a lot of work is there a Wisconsin has a lot of different cell types is there is a type of soil that these giant pumpkins prefer\nWell they're like the they liked it a little bit looser soil okay so you've got to see it live in an area that's heavy clay and stuff like that you got to figure out how to a man your style\nTo make it so that all of a sudden it's a little bit of a a looser ... Saddam sudden you're just like anything or their crops you know you've got to men to sign on when you've got to figure out what it needs so we ... test every spring and have a ball\nThat there's a there's work involved with it occurs looked involved with other sports are hobbies too and then we have an annual way off contests actually have like five of 'em in the state of Wisconsin every ball\nAnd these are normally at festivals okay we do have one more coming up this weekend and that's going to be at a machine that punk and fast\nOr that that's what's been going on for over twenty five years they closed the main street often we have a layoff there and um they have parades and and and it's a it's a party atmosphere to you know see who's gonna win\nSure so what happens with these giant pumpkins at the end of the season are you make a whole bunch of pumpkin pie or or what happens to them\nWell so that we set up a display with them that's what I mean my life to every other year we have a display that was set up at our yard\nAnd stuff like that uh we're in the process of moving right now is because all of a sudden we found a piece of property where we could ah um build a new home and we're in the process of moving or pumpkin patch next year will be a new place\nBecause this year it's kind of in limbo but most people like to put 'em on display as a matter of fact is that a part of a bigger organization to called or the great pumpkin commonwealth okay and they have a website called big pumpkins dot com where you can find out what all this information and they're\n... annual convention okay let me tell people is held somewhere in the world okay All right Ben in London already because we got growers a little over ... over in England and in Europe or it's been in

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n[noise] against the morning show on the ideas that work on John month\nLast week the Wisconsin Justice Department released previously unseen data relating to how law enforcement and the justice system handles domestic violence\nAmong the key findings in recent years prosecutors have sought less severe charges for domestic violence than the police we take a look at what that data means\nOn the morning show but first we want to make sure you have all the information you need if you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence\nYou can call the national domestic violence hotline that number is one eight hundred seven nine nine seven two three three if you can get information or details on resources ask questions about unhealthy aspects of a relationship\nSomeone will answer twenty four hours a day again that number eight hundred seven nine nine seven two three three\nSo what policy changes listeners do you hope to see when it comes to how\nWisconsin handles domestic violence so do you think the media to rest and domestic violence cases are important\nWhat about time in jail or prison you do you work in law enforcement are you an anti domestic violence advocate we would like to hear from you this hour\nEight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas at WNPR dot org is the email address or you can tweet us at WNPR mornings chase terrier as the\nPublic policy coordinator at and domestic abuse Wisconsin chase welcome to the morning show warning job thanks for having me let's look at the key takeaways from this data from the Wisconsin department of justice and maybe try and figure out what they actually mean starting with the fact that\nBetween twenty Thirteen and twenty sixteen the number of immediate arrest and domestic violence disputes or arrest that happens that happened right when police are called in\nA dropped by more than ten percent what's the significance of this statistic\nYeah that's a great question I I Would say the first thing to keep in mind that with this data there's a lot of variability from from county to county from community to community as far as how they're reporting these numbers so you really have to take them with a grain of salt um you know we we don't want to draw any broad conclusions from these numbers alone\nOr that being said you know there are some sort of important uh assumptions are cats as we can make about about what this has a what this is what the ...\nUm I Would say broadly are incidents of non fatal domestic violence\nHave dropped dramatically since the eighties and nineties if we there was a the bureau of justice statistics show that um non fatal domestic violence incidents declined sixty three percent between Nineteen\nNinety four and two thousand twelve a lot of that has to do with an increased priority on getting victim services out into the community so making sure that victims have access to those lifesaving services\nSo as that has increased we've seen a rest generally declined now as far as why immediate rats have declined um I think there's a number of reasons that we can look to for that\nOne of them is because a lot of times are victims don't want their abusers to be arrested maybe they call law enforcement because they want an interruption of the violence that's going on at that time\nBut they're not asking for for that abuse there to be immediately\nOr incarcerated so that's something we see quite often um and there's a lot of reasons for that it also is can be it in many communities that law enforcement is actually doing a better job of making fewer arrests when they aren't necessary so for example one mandatory rest was first passed back in the late eighties\nThere was a liability provision that meant that if you if a if a police officer was supposed to arrest somebody for mandatory rats and they didn't\nThey could be held accountable personally\nFor up to a thousand dollars which meant that they were arresting a lot of people that didn't need to be arrested including victims of crime and victims of met the domestic violence because they didn't want to held liable to be held liable for those things so so\nAs a as law enforcement has gotten better as domestic violence advocates have worked really hard to train I work with law enforcement to make them better are responding to these issues\nUm we've seen that general trend of rats going down and immediate or us going down with them so there's a lot of different reasons they can also be a strain on resources for law enforcement and and the justice system generally\nSo those are those mandatory arrest liabilities do those financial penalties still exist\nOr they do not is is my understanding I I have to check the statutes and see but um yeah that that that was something that was initially included and and lead to a lot of unnecessary arrest in uh\nIn Nineteen Ninety shortly after that was that was passed and that included those provisions they're over forty\nThousand arrests um so we see those numbers have been a lot higher in the in the past and so as we sort of reexamine some of those initial provisions included in that statute and look for ways to improve the law enforcement response of criminal justice response we've seen a rest sort of steadily declined over the years\nSo we have in this latest report we got three years' worth of data a can we call it a trend based on that or do we need to have more\nWell I mean you you can certainly you know it's interesting data I encourage people to take a look at it I think you know\nGas in in in the short term we can we can say yes this is a trend we can look at these cases but um it's important that we look at them in the broader context of what's been happening over the last few decades I Would also say that the twenty sixteen numbers are probably likely to change\nOr you might notice that there's a lot more open cases from twenty sixteen\nI had a chance to to speak to the folks at the OJ and they basically said yeah there's a lot more open cases but that's because they're more recent so a lot of those cases maybe are closed or will be closed but we won't have those numbers until the twenty Seventeen data out so there there's a couple of cats there that we have to make\nSo ... decided not to make an immediate arrest in a domestic violence incident\nYeah that that's a great question um so you know I think in general uh like I said it used to be in the past that a lot of times we would see things like dual arrests on the scene so maybe um there was there was an abusive situation there was some violence occurring and that the victim of domestic violence\nMaybe there would be some scratches or there would be some evidence that there had been violence from both sides or at least that's how it would be interpreted at the time so both of those people would be arrested I'm so as as domestic violence advocates I've worked really closely with law enforcement we've seen those types of incidents declined a lot um and that continues to go on\nAnd then like I said you know I think there's a growing recognition and the domestic violence community that the law enforcement response to the criminal justice response to domestic violence\nIsn't always the the best the best response it's not always what makes survivors more safe\nNow obviously there are always going to be cases where for the safety of that survivor for the safety of their family and for the community um abusers needs to be you know incarcerated or or they need to be arrested I'm at the scene of the crime but there are cases where\nA if you ask survivors if you talk to them you know what do you want to happen right now they might say well I just want the violence to stop right now but I don't want a my abuse or to go to jail you know maybe it would be extremely disruptive for their family maybe they know that if their abusers goes to jail they'll they're likely to lose their job and if they lose their job\nUm that income is is going to be gone from their family and that's going to put them in a very precarious situation so\nUm that's that's definitely part of the problem a but there's there's a lot of different factors that we have to take into consideration\nWe're talking about domestic violence a and a new report that's just out from the department of justice chased terrier the public policy coordinator at and domestic abuse Wisconsin\nA domestic violence inherently deals with people who have relationships how much do the wants to the victim play into what happens to someone accused\nYeah that that that's a good question as well I Would say um you know if you ask domestic violence advocates than people that work in the rest of violence we would say not enough uh and that's really one of our priorities is making sure that the criminal justice system\nLaw enforcement all of these systems that survivors come into contact with our what we call trauma informed that that's that's sort of a term you might hear tossed around a lot and\nIn this working and what that means to us is that um the ... the experience that survivors have these systems is grounded in what the survivor feels is best for them\nSo instead of telling a victim of domestic violence this is what's going to keep you safe this is what you need to do asking them what do you feel would keep you safe what do you feel is your first priority right now and acting on behalf of that rather than just telling victims of what they need or what they don't need\nWe're talking about domestic violence in Wisconsin in light of a new report from the Justice Department what policy changes do you hope to see\nOr to represent criminal defendants so there's a real burden place in our criminal justice system\nWhich has the effect of sort of a you know increasing the the amount that that ... and prosecutors have to sort of try to shuttle people through the system so\nRather than sort of um having the resources they need to to really apply nuance than in a specific approached each case they're more focused on you know what's going to stick what can I what can I filed charges filed that that are going to go through and are going to work and how can I sort of get this process started and\nEnded as quickly as possible because I've got so many other cases I've got to get to so maybe you know one charges were filed by the police they might say hey you know this is what I'm this is what I'm charging this person with the use of the crimes that I Would like to see\nAnd the d._a. takes a look at it and says well I don't know if I have evidence for that I don't know if I'm going to get that that charge so I'm going to lower down a little bit because I think I'm more likely to to get this case process so that's a big part of it um you've also always got the the the potential factor of maybe that that victim\nOr was involved in that case from the start but later on they may not want to testify against against their views are because as we mentioned before they may not want that abuse or to be incarcerated so so that that's a factor that has to be considered as well\nWe have a caller who wants to join us we'll go to Milwaukee and Marcus is on the line Marcus welcome to the morning show\nOn 'em so thank you for taking my call\n'em now this is a number of years ago but I was dating a woman when she got to a plane drinking she become physically island um\nAnd there's twice or where the police came to my residents one or the neighbors calls and once I ended up having the call 'em just to have her removed um one of the times the police were actually kind of sitting there laughing about it like you know like it's a woman hitting a guy you know like you can't handle this but I\nWas raised in that could put my hands are willing to hit a woman\nAnd so you know it's great that I took I had no other option because I was you know um but I\nChose not to prosecute because or one of the car with it'd be a ... what you were just talking about which is like what great crew you know and because there was a female attacking a man I'm I guess you didn't carry the same weight perhaps reading on air\nMarkets thanks for your story ... ...\nYeah I I really just mark is I Want to say thank you for that call a and and for sharing that that story you know that's the disclosing that has not always easy and I really appreciate it and it gets to a really important point which is that\nA domestic violence affects all people across all communities and all populations we know that one in four women are going to be the victim of violence from the hands of an intimate partner but also one in seven men also going to be\nImportant that we recognize that\nUm you know any anybody can can potentially um end up in an abusive relationship and it's it's never their fault and it's never something that that should that should be taken lightly\nUm and so certainly there is more we can do to make sure that um when anybody is contacting law enforcement whether they're man or a woman um you know gender non conforming whoever is is reaching out to law enforcement of the criminal justice system if they are a victim of domestic violence\nThey deserve to be taken seriously and they deserve to be given the services that that keep them safe so I just really want to want to thank mark is for for ... for sharing that with us 'cause uh you know that that that's really important and and I appreciate his point\nWe've got about a minute left here oh what policy changes are you looking for a from a for example the state legislature when it comes to how Wisconsin a handles domestic violence\nYeah that's a great question why you know and I think there's a there's a number of different areas that that we could focus on a first\nI think there are some broad criminal justice reforms that we would look to in conjunction with a lot of our partners that will sort of ease the burden\nThat is currently facing our criminal justice system so for example we're talking about things like ending truth and sentencing a particularly for for victimless crimes were talking about gee criminalizing drug possession especially for marijuana and low level possession charges are crimes that that really don't have victims are these are non violent crimes\nSo if if we sort of stop focusing on on crimes like that that our criminal justice system will have a lot of resources freed up to focus on violent crime and keeping people safe and keeping victims safe\nUm I think there's also policies we can look to that\nOr maybe wouldn't come from the legislature but are still really vitally important like\nUm the lethality assessment program\nIs a program that ensures that law enforcement is collaborating with with advocates in their area and it's a connecting victims to services and those really um windows in those cases that are are very have a high probability of homicide so that's that's a great program and I really encourage people to reach out to their law enforcement make sure they're\nIt's a nice ... we're going to have to leave it there and we're out of time a chase terrier public policy coordinator

brewers find themselves kind of up against the wall they need to do when two straight games at home against the Dodgers to make it to the world series how big a challenge or are they facing today for game six\nWell to the same challenge they'd been facing the last five games against the Dodgers just I I think you could argue is the best team in the national league you could easily put the brewers up in that conversation to to ...\nUh there is one of the most games here and they and um but uh the Dodgers are really good they've got a hall of fame future hall of fame pitcher in Cleveland curse shot who are in game five that\nI made their life miserable and and help the Dodgers pick a creature leading the theories\nAre they've got a they've got just a fence that just never lots out there they're good pretty much one through eight the lineup so I'm very very tough team but that being said the brewers and Dodgers scored the same number of rose through the first five games or is it Henry Fonda strategy that has worked for those so\nThey've they've been able to evade it pretty interesting with the Dodgers that's for sure and and now they get to more home games and if they wouldn't have both will be in their first world series since Nineteen eighty two\nWhen they were in the American league right yeah the ... the year I was born here a lot of fans are uh have have no recollection of or or just saying his recollections though so it's a long time coming yeah I I uh I remember\nAnd I suppose there is some competition to see who can grow the biggest one off\nCourse yes yes yes yes so basically I started at a in a in a nutshell started in a tavern okay you know how to tavern and\nBoy that's a that's a Wisconsin thing this all started in a tavern\nStarted to have it well they had a contest and and all of a sudden we were at a birthday party and and they ... they had it on a on a blanket they carry the four hundred pound punk and through the door\nAs my wife had actually got to start it and she says I'm a girl and ... and ... boys OK and uh that's that's what started this crazy process okay it's an addiction\nSo so we're probably ten years ago\nOkay so when we talk about giant pumpkins or how big are we talking you mentioned one that was a four hundred pounds that went through a tavern door what what's the average giant pumpkin these days\nWith the average well I just kinda like Wisconsin state record is right now okay it's over it's over a con okay it's twenty two hundred and eighty three I'm okay that's how you learn\nHow to even get that on the field\n[laughter] yeah that's that is getting to be a trick okay so lead use what we call lifting ring and we are the straps that go down there in the bottom so it's like a lifting ring that looks like a ... like a like a wheel off of a tractor okay and we ah we run\nSix strapped for eight straps down to the bottom with with raising the bottom and then you run a little brown and the bottom and that's how you pick up and move that\nThey're getting a challenging the move I tell you that got\nTo have a pretty big machine to lift that much also I Would think I\nKnow it takes a good trade machine yeah\nYeah uh what varieties ah do people turn to to grow giant pumpkins\nThe the varieties were growing up as a bill that lactic giants okay they were um\nUp in uh north east northeastern Canada area up in a you know the Providence day except there than what they call them light decrease in up in that area the maritime and a\nNew mayor of times you know it's up in the mirror times yes and people think that they they do better in hotter weather with no they don't they do better what we call a sixty five at night and eighty five during the day that Wisconsin has that kind of matter and we do very well may growing\nGlenn Martin is a member of the board of directors of the Wisconsin giant pumpkin growers are our pumpkins part of your family's falling activities where do you go to get them and how do you use them eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four tell us your pumpkin story eight hundred six four to one two three four do you grow giant pumpkins\nAnd how big was your giant pumpkin this year eight hundred six four to one two three four [noise] so uh Glenn it tell us what goes into growing a giant pumpkin as opposed to just growing the regular kind how do you get it to keep growing so the whole trick\nIs that all of a sudden a we control the growth of the plant just like your permanent apple tree but you got to remember this is fast paced he's he's a plants grow up to six inches to a foot a day okay vying for all this and the punk and growth can be upwards of fifty pounds a day okay\nTo explain that to ... an hour okay\n... what it is what it is we start 'em indoors in April and then a\nA mid April mid to late April and then create a little mini greenhouse at the beginning of the season but she got ... got a phantom during the day to get very warm and then the punk roots in every leaf that's the whole trick to growing up\nIs to get them to learning at every leaf okay and uh there's there's a lot of things that happen at every leap okay there we have the flower you have a nice to have you have on our ... so you got to figure out how to get them to go down and then you've got to figure out how to\nProperly feed him like he needed Trish in New England nutrition too and they're also\nHow much water uh that's the whole trick to grow in them and and then the other one is to keep the predators way you've got lots of predators that want this African insects animals to people that get in your garden and step into the wrong area\nHow [laughter] believe it or not it was so this this hobby is this hobby is starting to sound like a lot of work is there a Wisconsin has a lot of difference soil types is there is a type of soil that these giant pumpkins prefer\nWell they like the they liked it a little bit looser soil okay so you've got to see it live in an area that heavy clay and stuff like that you got to figure out how to a man your style to make it so that all of a sudden it's a\nLittle bit of a a looser soil Saddam he said you know just like anything or their crops you know you got to men to sign on when you've got to figure out what it needs\nSo we do it a failed test every spring and have a ball\nThat there's a there's work involved with it but there's work involved with other sports are hobbies too\nAnd then we have an annual way off contests actually have like five of 'em in the state of Wisconsin\nEvery ball and these are normally at festivals okay we do have one more coming up this weekend and that's going to be at a ... punk and fast ah that that's been going on for over twenty five years they closed the main street often\nWe have a layoff there and um they have parades and and and it's a it's a party atmosphere to you know see who's gonna win\nSure so what happens with these giant pumpkins at the end of the season are you make a whole bunch\nWell how did we mainly set up a display with them that's what I mean my life to average ... ... have a display that was set up at our at our yard and stuff like that uh we're in

be a new place\nBecause this year it's kind of in limbo but most people like to put 'em on display as a matter of fact I think that uh\nI'm part of a a bigger organization to called the great pumpkin commonwealth okay and\nThey have a website called big pumpkins dot com or you can find out where all this information and they're not part of it we have what we call an international annual convention
