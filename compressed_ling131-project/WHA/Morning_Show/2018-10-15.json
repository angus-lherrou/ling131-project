it and John nice to be there so\nLet's talk about the history of uh this mining is or processing waste ... mine explain the process that created the sediment\n[noise] right as you mentioned a of happened quite a while ago it was between Eighteen fifty Nineteen twenty nine the the ah major mining operations\nWere [noise] um [noise] in progress um and there were um like he went up and then slowly over a hundred and forty lines that were working the ... a copper load and along with that were forty mills which processed or Z and\nThis is the key factor because\nIs uh the fish is where I\nThink about mostly since I'm a fish biologist I'm a but like you said that tourism there are local um residents there of course right along that store that's being filled by [noise]\nUm [noise] the stamp fans there were natural\nWhite beaches along here that are now the black stamps fans out there is also a granted traverse bay harbor um which is right at that five\nAbout five mile a a extent down from the original pile and where I mentioned that this the fans have um arrived\nTo already [noise] um [noise] that harbor\nIs being over topped and clogged and we've had to do some maintenance dredging so all of the voting that comes out of it harbor\nA is affected 'em and and that includes fishing vessels that come out of there [noise] um [noise] and it also is a very important a harbor of refuge or without many others in the ... uh you know in that area this\nSo it's very important safety wise\nUm local economy as you know there are always a trickle down effect for all of these things so the fisheries for example uh it's not just the fisherman [noise] that ah are affected\nBecause the wholesalers the restaurants [noise] um and so on\nAnd [noise] go ahead\nWell I we ... we started to get some callers here when I make sure we get to those before we run out of time ... joins us from Miramax Matt Good morning welcome to the morning show\nAccording I was curious I'm a big yard at your picture of it uh it would take a clean up the problems are tiny speck ... oh yeah yeah\nThe figure uh the lining waste the original pile is twenty two point seven million metric tons\nDon't know how easy that is to envision another way of looking at it is six sixteen million cubic yards\nAnd then in\nTerms of acres it's like a close to three thousand acres\nI saw one description in an article I read in preparing for the program that it's enough to feel more than one point four million commercials dump trucks\nRight and that gives you an idea of how difficult it is going to be a to try to deal with it because uh you know filling those dump trucks and then the cost of transportation\nAnd the difficulty of placing that somewhere a because it is a the material that it is\nJust ... well that's that's actually a huge problem I mean you know okay so let's say that we could pick up all of this stuff in and get it away from buffalo reeds for example if we could get it out of the lake and I'm assuming that that's a challenge as well where would we put it where where can this be safely stored\nAnd those are the things that are being looked at right now there's a [noise] a taskforce group that was formed and that's multi agency with\nA federal state tribal local uh many entities involved and then a steering committee that are just recently has published or actually might not be published but it was a presented that a public meeting them will soon be published\nWith some possible options\nAre trying to start to just a brainstorm and come up with as many possible solutions says uh could be thought of and then\nThe idea is to narrow those down in two to three or four that are the most viable and tried to develop those further\nSo lake superior's really large body of water to talk about how pollution in one area but like you can have an effect in another\nYes um [noise] so as you mentioned there were hundreds of copper lines um hundreds of a waste deposits around the ... peninsula\nA researcher at Michigan Tech university Dr Charlie ... has looked at uh\nJust the copper concentrations old in the water surrounding the coupon peninsula and um has published a paper back in two thousand and four are showing that Carper\nHe calls it a cocker halo that surrounds a coupon off and on flood and that measurable\nConcentrations that goes all the way to the Canadian shore\n... was so what solutions are we looking at two to either to clean up the waste or or deal with the facts in in our those two different things\nUm I I'd say they're very much connected\nAnd they're also connected with your previous question about um the effect\nOn local economy but the other side of the economy is the cost of dealing with it and where you kind of alluded to that you know just the difficulty of dealing with uh these deposits that are out in the water and then what do you do with um [noise] so\nUm the figure that's been thrown out there is if we were [noise]\nA deal with the whole deposit it would be in the neighborhood of a five hundred million dollars so when [noise] that kinda money is\nBeing put out there uh as I said we've tried to look at all the different possibilities\nIncluding not doing anything because uh you know before you put money out like that you got to figure out what can you do what what what are you getting for that money and is it worth it so\nI'm all the way from not doing anything what a what the economic and long lasting environmental effects be two um dredging everything\nA different uh disposal site options and then uh even stocking the fishery to replace the ...\nThe production was lost on the reef a and also looking at something like a building a different brief in the area that it would be affected by the stamps and that could\nRealistically how long does buffalo read have before it's completely overtaken by the stamps and\nUm I Would think [noise] uh let's see so it's about thirty five percent covered right now and uh I think it would be another fifty years or so before the the reef would be completely covered\nBut its effectiveness it diminishes every time another anchor is a is covered in and pretty soon the fish that have been spawning they're won't have any place to uh to do that the lab to either go somewhere else or die off correct\nThat's our beliefs but we don't have good\nA measurement of that so you know at a\n... you were just expect that uh\nUh the more that it gets covered the less that production I was going to be used but we don't know I'm In detail how much of the reef is used by fares so those are some of the questions that we want to try to get better knowledge of ah going\nForward again to have a better idea of what I'm options are best served here\nSo very quickly made less than a minute left if a new minor processing plant were to open today in the UP so it would be operating under completely different rules could we see this kind of thing happen again\nNo we couldn't this is a legacy problem that uh is just from the past mining practices and no we won't see those again [noise]\nAll right then that's a I think where we can leave the ... a fisheries biologist in Lake Superior basin coordinator for the Michigan department of natural resources thank you are filled were a joining us this morning\nThere welcome and I appreciate your interest\nComing up on the morning show we will consider the increase in vaping among teenagers in one Wisconsin county where now are almost one in five teams reports having made dinner last

issues but\nI think it's important to increase awareness that kids are using the the bathrooms to to do all specifically\nWell let's talk about the you mentioned that uh the ... higher concentration of nicotine then um regular vaping pounds but they both\nAdminister what is the key drugs out is contained in a tobacco um and it's so why people smoked\nIn nicotine is a is a according to what the research shows is highly addictive ... how are we dealing with this issue with the with teenagers who who use this nicotine regularly\nYeah you're you're totally correct so the main component of these e cigarette products is nicotine and we do know that nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs out there\nAnd it should be noted that we don't want our young people to be using nicotine products because it can disrupt proper brain development and young people and we know that young people's brains um continue to develop until they're aged twenty five\nI'm an easier it's also include other ingredients that a lot of people don't realize so they do contain cancer causing chemicals such as formaldehyde and then they also have um a lot of heavy metals such as nickel tat ten and led\nSo the um or can we draw a line between the use of these are very ... and ... and eventual conversion to smoking\nThese products are not face and that hopefully one day and leave all the at the same um

prepare you to be lieutenant governor do you think so\nA lot of the biggest things I Do as I I I managed people so I that's [laughter] a lot of what you do as an executive is being able to\nOr Republicans are outspending Democrats Walker Walker Governor Walker and the party and the groups that are allied with him are advocating for his reelection\nOr outspending the Democratic side um including Tony ... and his allies by about two to one which is not really very surprising given um Governor Walker's fundraising history and given the fact that he's a two term incumbent and given the fact that Tony ...\nIs really making his first really partisan statewide campaign\nSo then how much of this money is from the campaigns are and political parties themselves or and how much is from outside groups\nWell what's interesting about the Wisconsin we've seen you know nationally when you look at federal racist for house and Senate and for governor you've seen sort of a an up tick in the amount in the in the role that that sort of independent groups are outside groups are playing um\nAnd then in ... includes group set up by the parties um that's partly because\nYou know of can't change it in the campaign finance laws the these groups operate under more liberal rules and the candidates so it's easier for them\nTo raise money in some cases they don't have to disclose their donors hum and so ah we've seen an expansion and their role um the Wisconsin race or they're playing a really big role I'm bigger than they have in the past and bigger on average than other races for governor around the country\nI'm In the period we looked at which is from the day after the August fourteenth primary to the first week of October um it was about two thirds of all the money spent again we're just talking here about broadcast advertising but that's the single biggest expense in most cases for campaign so two thirds of the money was coming from\nOutside groups and it was pretty big on both sides I mean even though the Democrats are being outspent\nThey were relying heavily on a group set up by the Democratic Governors Association biggest Tony Evers didn't really have any money when he came out of the primary he didn't have a lot of money in the primary and an Scott Walker side you got you know a lot of urgency among Republicans about his race Scott Walker has a lot of money but it but he's also in the race of his life\nAnd so um there are groups on the Republican side both state based groups and national groups that have a vested interest in his reelection so uh they're playing a very large role in this campaign\nWell into an ... didn't have much fundraising experience coming into this race either did\nHe know I mean he's you know he he doesn't have a big part of the history of the state school superintendent hum\nAnd that has implications to beyond just the money is being spent I mean he you know he came into this race as without much of a political identity in Wisconsin and so\nThat can be a precarious place for a candidate um because it means that you know your your identity your image can really be forged in the campaign which which makes you vulnerable to all the spending that's done against you\nIt also means you know you have the ability depending on how much money you have to kind of create an influence the identity the image you want to project to voters but you're kind of like an ... painted canvas for most people\nAnd that's when a ads can really have an impact I mean Scott Walker has kind of the opposite in the sense that\nEverybody knows him almost everybody has an opinion about it people are very evenly divided about him so it's really hard to influence opinion very much\nKnow a lot of the advertising even though Scott Walker the governor a lot of the advertising is about Tony ... because I'm Republicans are trying to define him negatively for voters 'cause they know the Scott Walker that opinion about Scott Walker is pretty entrenched\nSo are we seeing anything new in this election cycle in terms of who's spending and what they're paying for\n'em I think one new thing is just what we talked about which is the ... the percentage of the advertising the broadcast outspending 'em by the groups is a really large and that and I think that's also a reflection of just the national importance of this race I mean it's symbolically important to people in both parties because\nOf Scott Walker's history you know his recall of course was a big national nationalized campaign\nAnd so it would be a huge victory for Democrats to knock him off it's very important for Republicans to defend beyond all the normal reasons to defend\nHis governorship so that's one thing and the other thing is when you look at what the um what the advertising is a bow and the governor's race is kind of interesting because\nI'm the one there's one issue that is sort of a central part of the message of both parties and that's the issue of education now education is not weird for education to play a role in races for governor you wouldn't see it in a race for Congress or the Senate because it's not as big a federal role in education but\nI'm Around the country uh education shows up at about one out of every three ads for governor but in Wisconsin It's like seven out of hand\nAnd so it is played a huge role and I think that's a reflection of the recent history of the state Scott Walker has some vulnerabilities on education because of his education cuts because of act ten\nHe's got an argument to make about education that he he's calling himself the education governor Democrats are attacking him on the issue he knew he'd be attacked so he's out there defending and touting his education record Democrats are spending a lot of money attacking is education record and the result is is really the only issue that both sides are talking about a lot in their ads\nFor the rest of the issues are issues in some cases you would expect Democrats to talk about and they are which is healthcare they're also talking a lot about roads which is kind of a little novel you don't normally see lots of ads about roads I'm In a statewide election and Republicans are talking about Republican issues like taxes\nAnd public safety and um and Scott Walker is also kind of touting his economic record in some of these ads too well\nAnd Republicans are saying that ... elected governor that the price of gas is going up by a dollar a gallon and everybody's income tax will be increased and and so forth\nYeah and that's a very kind of typical traditional Republican and kind of line of attack 'em and um you know it's interesting when Scott Walker um when when the primaries were over and Scott Walker knew who his Democratic opponent would be\nUm the first big line of attack\nWas over this case that got a lot of attention that has since gotten a lot of attention about a teacher who\nAh who is viewed pornography and his email and he was disciplined by a school district but he wasn't fired and so a ton of ads were aired criticizing Tony ... is with the fact that this teacher wasn't fired I'm Tony ... said he couldn't fire him because of that you couldn't be fired because of the the um\nThe way to state law was written at the time\nAnd a lot of money was spent on that that those ads\nUh it's not really clear from the polling whether those ads had much effect because Tony Evers they didn't really drive up Tony ... at least in the in the polling that Marquette law school does and they're the most regular pollster in the state\nBut there is some evidence that the that the ... the sort of new line of attack in recent weeks that we that you just mentioned which is he's going to raise your taxes hum and undo everything I've done their son\nPoll a Tony reverse negatives have gone up more than ... deposit it in the last month um so the polling is a little conflicted\nOn on on the race and Antoni ... because you've got an old by NBC and merit painting a rosier picture for Democrats and you've got the market ball which sort of portrays the race as a dead heat and again as as Tony Evers negatives rising to some degree\nAnd and this is a big part of the dynamic in the closing weeks of the election because again Scott Walker opinion about Scott Walker's really entrenched but what if people know and what people think about Tony ... and that's what a lot of the ad wars are about\n... I guess the interesting thing about this is a that argument over taxes is that a whoever's governor of the legislature is quite likely to be a good remain in Republican hands\nAnd I'm just wondering if they expect a governor if it if it is governor ... ah how he would manage to get people's taxes increased but\nUm that wouldn't fit in a in a thirty second campaign ad um so what does spending looked like in various regions of Wisconsin where the Democrats spending more and what about Republicans\nYeah I mean there are sort of dramatic very dramatic differences and the governor's race um the Democrats are most competitive in spending on other words they're spending disadvantages smaller\nIn the two big markets of Milwaukee in Green Bay I mean they're spending you know like Seventy percent of their ad money at least on broadcast television\nIn those two markets that's whereabouts sixty percent of the state's voters are um and um and and then in the smaller markets you've got some markets where Republicans have a bigger advantage they have a bigger advantage in the western marketable across any ... all across the release swinging\nMarket that's very key to this race because those voters in western Wisconsin you know a lot of them swung from Obama Trump they've swung back and forth with respect to Walker um Wausau central in northern Wisconsin is a more Republican Mark it includes a lot of rural voters\nYou know usually when one side has more money than the other um they have the luxury of spreading that spending around geographically and that's what you see 'em Governor Walker doing we haven't talked\nMuch about the U.S Senate race but there is a democratic spending advantage in that race\nOkay and I want to come back to that because you're going to stay with us and we'll have a lot more to talk about Craig Gilbert stays with us She's a political reporter and the Washington bureau chief for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel you can weigh in an eight hundred six four to one two three four\nIt's kind of reform issue which probably has more currency and for example a Democratic primary but in terms of a general election you're not going to see you know major ad campaigns built around that issue typically\nWe just have the uh the Green Party candidate for lieutenant governor on just before we spoke to you and and that is a one of the green parties issues is money getting money out of politics uh and uh that's certainly something they're talking about but then you don't see a lot of Green Party\nTelevision advertising either before the news you mentioned spending a and ads in the U.S Senate race how does that differ from what we're seeing in the race for governor\nWell the the big differences there is actually it it is not as much money being spent I'm In this period we looked at that was about fourteen million dollars in in broadcast ads in the race for governor and about six million in broadcast ads for the race for US Senate hum\nThat tells you a couple of things I mean it tells you that the race is not as nationally targeted as hum as the governor's race Tammy Baldwin has been with the subject of a lot of early spending by outside groups on the Republican side\nBut she's sort of kind of weather that storm if you believe the polling and so you're not seeing as much outside activity in the Senate race certainly\nNot as much outside activity overalls and the governor's race in fact you know they're really the Democratic groups are barely involved and Tammy Baldwin's race because they're pretty confident about the way things are going and she's raised a lot of money so almost all the spending on the Democratic side has been from her\nWith the expectation of with the exception of one group called the vote bets on on the Republican side you know the vote or had to go through a competitive primary against a very well funded opponent I'm Kevin Nicholson and she didn't have much money and she's a state legislator so she doesn't have a\nYou know apart from which to raise a ton of money and so outside groups have come in\nAnd actually spent more money on her behalf and she spent on her own but that's still not enough um they haven't come in and a big enough way\nTo offset the Democratic spending advantage is August and again I'm there so many Senate races around the country that you see groups these groups on the outside um\nWho want the Republicans to retain their Senate majority are making kind of ... decisions about which races are the are the you know the easiest ones or the most plausible ones for\nThem to win her race has not been prioritized by those groups the same way um you see in some other states I mean there's there's democratic incumbents like Tammy Baldwin but who are running for reelection and much more conservative states and they are bigger targets right now\nWell the um uh and and\nOf ... in her a primary battle that was really negative and there was a lot of money spent against her in that and so she had to spend some money you know kind of right off the bat trying to repair that damage how successful do you think that does her well been here\nI think it's been a rocky road for her again all we have to go on it the polling well we have we have more than the public to go out we have the sort of the it's not just the polling that tells you to stay the race it's also the behavior of groups on the outside and and what I just mentioned is sort of in a barometer of that\nBut also in the polling you know her numbers have been kind of\nFollow fell into negative territory after\nThe primaries and they've been there since she did take some hits during the primaries and Kevin Nicholson ran it sort of an outsider and painted her in the Republican primaries kind of an establishment Republican and we ran an ad at one point saying you know re pricing\nCriticism she had made of Donald Trump during the twenty sixteen primary\nAnd so she kinda got it from that direction during the primary and now she's being attacked from the left\nParticularly on healthcare we've talked about what the ads are about they're overwhelmingly about healthcare on the Democratic side in in races for house the Senate and that's that's very true of this race of the U.S Senate race in Wisconsin where\nTammy Baldwin's been blasting away at her over her position on health care and basically making the argument that she would support you know a rotating a um guarantees protections when it comes to health care coverage\nSo she's been hit by that and she doesn't again she's not well funded so she doesn't have as much money to sort of fight back and and it ... and so she's at a disadvantage there and her numbers um or numbers have not been great\nWe are talking with Craig Gilbert political reporter and Washington bureau chief for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel eight hundred six four to one two three four what do you think about campaign spending\nIn the race for governor of the race for Senate or just in a kind of general terms or does it affect you how do you look at all of this\nBarrage of political advertising and maybe you're living in a part of the state that doesn't get a lot of TV ads so you're going what barrage but if you are in one of those markets where you're getting a ton of this stuff what do you think about it let's take a quick call from John who joins us from superior Don thanks for joining us on the morning show go ahead\n[noise] yes um I had a daughter that was an office in um when she ran for reelection I did doors talk to a lot of people uh people came and gave me the conclusion that they didn't want to hear the truth that they're already set in their minds\nWhat they had heard on television in in in the um finance ads that were used against or that were\nRidiculously crazy on true and they didn't want to hear the truth it's um it's amazing you know I Would do doors and they'd say well she's for abortion and I said is she for abortion why she got daughters\nYou know people can't relate to what's going on\nSo I Hope I Hope the false advertisement gets gets stopped\nAll right and we're just about at the time to take

[noise] as you mentioned a it's a\nHappened quite a while ago it was between Eighteen fifty Nineteen twenty nine the the ah major mining operations\nWere [noise] um [noise] and progress um there were like he went off and then slow over a hundred and forty in life\nThat were working the ... a cough or load and along with that were forty mills which processed or Z and [noise] this is\nThe key factor because the orders\nIs that fish is where\nI think about mostly in federal fish biologist I'm a but like I said the tourism there are local residents there of course a right along the shore that's being filled in by [noise]\nUm [noise] the stamps fans there were natural white beaches along there that are now the black stamps fans of there's also a grand ... harbor um which is right at that five\nAbout five miles of a extent down from the original pile of where I mentioned that the the fans have um arrived\nTo already [noise] um [noise] that harbor is being over topped ... and we've had that there was some maintenance dredging so all of the voting that comes out of it harbor a is affected 'em and and that includes the fishing\nVessels they've come out of there [noise] um [noise] and it also is a very important ah harbor of refuge or without many others in the ... uh you know in that area that is\nSo so it's very important safety wise um local economy as you know there are always a trickle down effect for all of these things so the fisheries for example uh it's not just the Fisher\nBut the wholesalers the restaurants [noise] um and so on [noise] go ahead\nWell I I we ... we started to get some callers here when I make sure we get to those before we run out of time ... joins us from Miramax Matt Good morning welcome to the morning show\nGood morning I was curious I'm a big jar to jump in here that it would take a cleanup problem are talking that aspect I guess ... yeah\nThe figure or the line in ways to the original pile is twenty two point seven million metric tons and I I don't know how easy that is to envision another way of looking at it is\nSix sixteen million cubic yards\nAnd and then in\nTerms of acres it's like a close to three thousand acres\nI saw one description in an article I read in preparing for the program that it's enough to feel more than one point four million commercials dump trucks\nRight and that gives you an idea of how difficult it is\nGoing to be a to try to deal with it because uh you know filling those dump trucks and then the cost of transportation and the difficulty of placing that somewhere a because it is a the material that it is\nJust ... well that's a that's actually a huge problem I mean you know okay so let's say that we could pick up all of this step in and get it away from buffalo read for example if we could get it out of the lake and I'm assuming that that's a challenge as well where would we put it where ... where can this be safely stored\nAnd those are the things that are being looked at right now there's a [noise] a taskforce group that was formed and that's multi agency with a federal\nState tribal local uh many entities involved and then a steering committee that are just recently has published or actually might not be published but it was a presented at a public meeting will soon be published\nWith some possible options I'm trying to start to just a brainstorm and come up with as many possible solutions says uh could be thought of\nAnd then the idea is to narrow those down in two to three or four that are the most viable and tried\nTo develop those further\nSo Lake Superior is a really large body of water to talk about how pollution in one area but like you can have an effect in another\nYes um [noise] so\nAs you mentioned there were hundreds of copper lines um hundreds of\nA waste deposits around the peninsula a researcher at Michigan Tech university Dr Charlie ...\nHas looked at uh\nJust the copper concentrations old in the water surrounding the coupon peninsula and um\nHas published a paper back in two thousand and four I'm showing that Carper he calls it a cocker halo that surrounds a coupon all peninsula and that measurable concentrations that goes all the way to the Canadian short\n... west so\nEither to clean up the waste or or deal with the facts in in our those two different things\n[noise] um I I'd say they're very much connected and\nThey're also connected with your previous question about\nUm the effect on local economy but the other side of the economy is the cost of dealing with it and we've kind of alluded to that you know just the difficulty of dealing with uh these deposits that are out in the water and then what do you do with um [noise] so um\nThe figure that's been thrown out there is if we were to try to [noise] a deal with the whole\nDeposit it would be in the neighborhood of a five hundred million dollars so one [noise] that kinda money is\nBeing put out there as I said we tried to look at all the different\nPossibilities including not doing anything because uh you know before you put money out like that you gotta figure of what can you do what what what are you getting for that money and is it worth it so\nI'm all the way from not doing anything what a what the economic and long lasting environmental effects be two um dredging everything\nA different uh disposal fight options and then\nI'm even stocking the fishery to replace the ... the production is lost on the reef a and also looking at something like a building a different brief in the area that uh would be affected by the stamps and that could\nRealistically how long does buffalo read have before it's completely overtaken by this damn sense\n[noise] um I Would think [noise] uh let's see so it's about thirty five percent covered right now and uh I think it would be another fifty years or so before the the reef would be completely covered\nBut its effectiveness it diminishes every time another anger is a is covered in and pretty soon the fish that have been spawning they're won't have any place to uh to do that though up to either go somewhere else or die off correct\nThat's our beliefs but we don't have good a measurement of that so you know at a ... were you were just expect that uh\nUh the more that it gets covered the less that production I was going to be used but we don't know I'm In detail how much of the reef is used by fares so those are some of the questions that we want to try to get better knowledge of ah going forward\nAgain to have a better idea of what I'm options are best served here\nSo and very quickly my blessed in a minute left even knew minor processing plant were to open today in the UP ... it would be operating under completely different rules could we see this kind of thing happen again\nNo we couldn't this is a legacy problem that uh is just from the past mining practices and ah no we won't see this again [noise]\nAll right then and that's a I think where we can leave this is Phil ...

it should be noted that we don't want our young people to be using nicotine products because it can disrupt proper brain development and young people and we know that young people's brains um continue to develop until they're aged twenty five\nI'm a cigarette's also includes other ingredients that a lot of people don't realize so they do contain cancer causing chemicals such as formaldehyde and then they also have um a lot of heavy metals such as nickel tat ten and led\nTo the um or can we draw a line between the use of these are very ... and ... and eventual conversion to smoking I'm a ... is that something that's going to happen\nYeah so I think there there is evidence out there to suggest that um kids who use the cigarette products who have never smoked a cigarette in their lives are more likely to switch to conventional cigarettes in the future so there is some initial research out there\nTo to to to make that link which is very concerning for us in public health [noise]\nNo it's illegal to was shoulders material to people under Eighteen I understand in over the years stores around during county have received fines for showing you cigarettes to minors or how have the stories reacted to the uptick in underage interest in these devices\nYeah so we were I'm able to start I'm checking the shops and other establishment to sell you cigarette products in twenty Fifteen for compliance purposes\nAnd um when we first started um checking compliance for each cigarette sales um we did see actually a a large percentage of folks on selling those products\nAnd uh you know anecdotally talking to clerks who were selling a lot of them didn't realize that they had to check ID's so we have been doing as the coalition I'm active outrage too they shop specifically to um\nAddress the issue of compliance um increase their knowledge that they should be checking ID's for these products and really encouraging them to train their staff per a\nTrain their staff to to checking id and to know the consequences of selling nicotine products to young people\nAre of our state and local lawmakers getting into this as well or is there anything being done on that front to address the underage you should be cigarettes\nI'm not here locally in Wisconsin unfortunately um but with the FDA coming out in addressing these products and and saying that there is an epidemic of youth use of these products I think that will start a national conversation about young people's use of\nOf the east cigarettes and nicotine products so I really hope that um states around the nation a including ours really do um take that seriously and start I'm Talking about policies to address you use\nWhat about parents who or what should parents be doing here\nI think overall parents should just become informed um again like educators um I've talked to a lot of parents who don't even know what a jewel is so I think just just being aware of what these products are what they look like and having an honest conversation with your kids\nIs of these products and and how you could potentially become a cigarette smoker on a few began using these products at a young person\nWhat about the role of students in helping each other or avoid avoid these products I mean they seem pretty cool though is there a way to make them a ... kind of vote the way we tried to do with cigarettes\nYeah I think I think teens could play a huge role in our prevention efforts and luckily for us we do have a youth prevention groups called fact and that they really do a peer to peer education and encourage their peers not to use these products\nAnd we have a solid group in Oregon, Wisconsin as well as Lodi, Wisconsin and they're doing a lot of work at the in their local communities as well as our high schools to um inform their their peers around these products and encouraging their fellow high school students and that is\nSo ... will ruin forward what to what your hope what are you hoping happens here\nI really hope that people become aware and realized that these products are not safe and that hopefully one day um leave all the at the same um social norms around these products as we do with cigarettes\nBecause we don't want our young people to be at the next generation up that nicotine and tobacco products\nNina Gregor certain health education coordinator with a public health Madison to
