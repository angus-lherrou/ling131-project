Jeremy ... of flux designs a company that has its fingerprints on some of Milwaukee's most iconic destinations Jeremy a welcome to the morning show\n\nAnd ... good morning John nice oh there you are I'm Sorry I just I just woke up but it's a good place to be\nWell [laughter] maybe I Need to wake up no no I mean\nWhen you when you started or when you started your career what a downtown Milwaukee looked like\nA downtown Milwaukee kind of a looks like an average ... out of it's a wonderful life\nOkay so ... what does that mean precisely just look old or used up or what\nWell um it was a it it would be the kind of a place where you might see a a Jimmy Stewart walk out and uh and say that he was a banker but he didn't know if it was going to be a a great day or not there'd be a car's rolling around from the Nineteen fifties\nThe ... the designation comes when people along the road decide that people that had that on the property along the road\nDecided they'd like to maintain the kind of rural special character that that part of the the highway and ah they they have a petition process where other people along the road a and others who are are concerned can signed the petition and then it goes to\nA a a rustic roads board it goes through the local transportation authorities in the minister Paolo they were the road is located\nAnd eventually if they all kind of agree they send out a an emissary they send out a a person to to go check the road ah from the rustic rose board to make sure that it did kind of meet the qualifications of having\nKind of a unique agricultural look\nOr or it has superb natural vegetation that might be unusual that you don't see also where the probably also has abundant wildlife\nAnd it doesn't have a real big ah you know paved shoulders on the road usually they're they're usually relatively narrow and a two lane and a beautiful to the drive but they go out and then if the board approved and everybody is is in agreement\nThen the road actually gets the designation rustic road\nThere's a special sign that gets put up on either end and also gets a number a they'd been numbered in the order that they were created and a ... as we said there's a hundred and twenty of them now so the next one up or wherever that will be will be road ... number one hundred and Twenty one [noise]\nSo let's say hit the road so to speak and turn our attention first to the northern parts of the state a lot of northern counties well trees are at or near ... color if there are any leaves left after the big wins we had a few days\nIs just a rustic wrote forest in northern Wisconsin\nWell I I you know I there's a there's a lot of great roads up there and I think that uh up in the ah oh up and the the actual in Bay field a county area uh there's some great rose up there I kind of like number one\nIt uh it has a lot of the the great natural vegetation that that you see up in that part of the state or in summer it's known for having all the lakes and wild flowers up there it kind of runs from this one runs pretty much from Mercer\nOn up to the Wisconsin Michigan border a kind of follows highways H in jeans and a goes past all awake and version like clear lake spider lake\nAnd a really runs through some of that area where you're quite likely to see wildlife up there ah I Know when I was up in that area not too long ago a there is talk of some folks that had spotted a few bear that were wandering through the area a wolves are not uncommon and certainly white tailed deer are are almost everywhere so\nUh it really has that flavor of the north woods that you want to have when you get up there\n... what about a door county\nDark comedy as great a dark comedy has a lots of new ones and and it really has a one of the longest rustic roads in the state is in dark comedy now I've got to qualify that by mentioning that that that one is number one hundred and Nineteen and uh it's uh\nUh it it's on Washington Island so you have to take a ferry to get out there but uh it's really neat and I I Know you've been to Washington Island I Know a lot of people have not because you have to catch the ferry to get out there\nBut if you go out there they kind of a in circles the whole island and ah it really gives you a great flavor of what it's like to be out on a on an island out on the great lakes and uh\nIt it's really need you know and of course it if you get up there to\nWashington Ireland you'll want to stop at a places like the Nelson hall where you can become a member of the ... club and uh the bidders club of course is for people who uh enjoy the taste of bitter Z and you can stop and and and do that um\nBut there's also also you know a lot of need beaches along the way\nThere are a fun thing to do on the island there's fishing there swimming and uh definitely well worth checking it out number one Nineteen uh and it's a twenty seven miles long a and a number one hundred Nineteen in the book on page Ninety five\nBut said talk a little bit about western Wisconsin little a little screwed across the state now at what rustic roads recommend over there\nI Would head for Polk County the folks up in poll comedy have really taken this to heart and I think they have like six or seven of them are in that part of the states and uh\nUh there's you know the ... the whole western part of the state has a different kind of a a geology that they'd shape that\nAre as appalled as opposed to the lake area or down in southwest Wisconsin but it's really pretty up in the area big rolling hills wonderful deciduous trees up there\nThis is a great time of the year to go up in that area and ah and check out the poll comedy the St Croix river area or in and get a look at some of the places up there\nA rustic road number one hundred a is over in iron comedy and that one is also another really need one but uh I Would I Would suggest number one oh three\nWhich are all that it runs only two point eight miles but it goes along the saint Croix river\nAnd uh you can go up there and ah it it starts at Somerset landing a which is a river access point then in the St Croix national scenic river way area and ah there's a snowmobile route that goes through there so if you go through and in winter you can actually see part of the road\nGoes along won all three as well uh but it's really kind of a a really neat one to to check out [noise]\nSo let's not forget about non rustic roads white drive you can suggest for those visiting the western part of the state\nWell I'm over in a you know certainly in the western part of the state the big road over there that everybody ought to do I mean it's it's not a rustic road because it's so popular and in many ways the great river road which follows the Mississippi River\nOr and or goes all the way along over there ah from down and start stone in the ... area actually a little south of there and goes all the way up through lacrosse in front of the cross goes on up to a Saint Paul but the great river road has got that whole Mississippi\nRiver ... and you go through a lot of those beautiful little small towns over there\nUh that all have antique stores and and a great places to dying and if you're lucky you can get a catfish dinner over in that area\nBut it it's it's really a a great place to check out the whole feeling of the Mississippi River area and ah it this time of the year it's especially fun\nUh and the the neat thing about it is for some reason it seems like the trees along the southern part of the great river road St from lacrosse on south\nThey turn a little bit later than the ones up in northern Wisconsin so I just saw a report from a Wisconsin tourism that said that the leaves up there as you said a few minutes ago\nWe're at peak before a lot of them got blown off but uh there's there's still another week or two to go in southwest Wisconsin\nAnd just kind of the way the leaves have been turning for years is that that area tends to be a little bit later so if you want to go out and do a great fall drive and see a lot of leaves I Would definitely consider doing the great river road\nAh from La Crosse on south uh down to a ferry go down to very do Shane and I actually had gone down from there toward a Dubuque, Iowa and it's a it's a beautiful drive [noise]\nSo uh the uh well let me just say this that Gary Knell is the president

segment now very quickly what the rustic wrote habit we talked about yet that but people really need to try out\nUm I Would say had up to a man to walk into rivers up to that area\nA there's a road up there that runs from actually from two rivers and runs up the point beach state park and a little bit past that its rustic road numbers sixteen and it is just a fabulous drive\nA it'll take you in in kind of a offshore a Michigan driving through some really beautiful pine woods up there if you go in summer or has the does he got a nice day in fall roll the windows down you can smell the pines as you drive through\nAnd uh and then when you get up to the point beach state forest by all means turn in and go down and see one of the most beautiful beaches on Lake Michigan\nUh it's about six seven mile beach\nOr at point beach state park white sand and ah it's ah it's just beautiful Lake Michigan out there any time of the year even if in his army days is really an interesting place to be in and

lessen my wrist a risk of breast cancer does new science of say that was a mistake\nSo she's in a myriad still has proprietary information about you are seeing breast cancer risk one information do they still have that they that they won't share\nI'm like I mentioned they have Seventeen thousand variants of the hour ca mutations on\nThat are that are proprietary that um other researchers aren't able to to tap into two on\nCross reference but their own research over there are a couple of databases that on to share this knowledge publicly if there is the ... exchange or be RCA exchange which carry IT security that data platform that that's\nIn collaboration with other research labs and scientists that can input their research on the air ca mutations and\nUm make it known whether they're a variant of unknown significance benign or pathogenic so there are ways that the public can can access let their mutation is once they receive that information and their platforms for physicians and researchers to access as well to cross reference they're fine they\nUnderstand that the national Institute for health or ... database and more recently a study published in nature classifying additional two thousand V. RCA\nMutations as a either benign or pathogenic uh what do we know about ... this is something the general public can get out and if we could what use would we make of it yeah so\nThey did me these databases public on the Clinton bar database is on Jews in the ... exchange among other databases that are in there as well\nFor the public unless you test test for this gene\nThe database doesn't really do anything for you you need to know exactly what you're very and is to search it on there the first scientists that means a lot it means that they can play around with gene editing and see what these genes mean tests for these unknown variants which are also listed in the databases\nAnd use it whether they're studying more than just about them you taste in itself or treatments for cancer related to these genes\nAnd hundred six four to one two three four let's take a call from stuff in a huge joins us from Madison stuff when he good morning\nI'm calling about I'm\nA research article I read a few years back on out is trailing are sweeter Sweden that really looked at one experiences who has a\nOn a positive ... one or two mutation and it wasn't necessarily looking at\nPressure from providers about meeting could do something but it was pressure when an experience for families about potentially not going through with this surgery that could prevent cancer from happening like your ... said\nYou know like the guest said either significant surgeries and they really needs to be carefully thought\nThere especially you know get and you know Neal emerging research and when they really felt you know the pressure\nSearch I guess that would keep you around longer\nAs Susan what about what Stephanie has to say here\nYeah I think it's really important to note um especially because a lot of women are undergoing these surgery that younger ages\nUm for instance I have friends actually who tested positive for this scene and their families has not wanting to get them to go underground to undergo surgery they found that it was too drastic and they tried to talk and out\nOf that um I brought my parents do every single a doctor's appointment\nAnd at the end of the day they told me it was my decision they would support me either way I think once I decided that I Would get a preventative surgery there were a little relieved just because\nWe're told that you have an eighty seven percent chance of developing breast cancer in your lifetime it's more than likely that you're going to develop cancer and what family member parents especially want to see their their child or their family goes through cancer on\nBut I Do think there's a lot of pressure on both sides of that to undergo surgery or to not undergo surgery at all\nWhat about the public perception of breast cancer and broccoli and how that's changed since Angelina Jolie is very public surgeries and struggle with cancer is is uh is this a good thing because of increased awareness or a bad thing because more people may miss understand what you're seeing mutations are and how they work\nI think they're a little bit of the fair I'm ... and Julie being so public about Herbie RCA mutation has opened the door to a lot of lemon knowing that there is this test available on considering their family history but there is also the sense that you know they they sort of\nCelebrity trend now I Need to get this test because maybe I have this gene and maybe I Need to undergo surgery without fully knowing that only ten percent of breast cancers are linked to be RCA mutation so that's a very slim group of people that are going to fit in the Angelina Jolie category\nAnd again I just cannot stress enough how important it is to talk about this with a doctor with a genetic counselor before you even thinking about taking the tax\nWhere can we get more information we got about thirty seconds left what's the best place for people to go\nOn there is an awesome organization at the University of Pennsylvania called the ... of you good at ... dot org you'll be able to find a ton of resources there isn't any\nThings along Suzanne appreciate your time this morning\nThanks so much time in the

of the um benefits of having a digital platform\nEither through a store website or some other marketplace like Amazon you can't compare prices very easy you know it's very transparent the same item a different price point the other option that she mentioned is you know there've been lots of um local\nOpportunities for people to\nExchange items they no longer lead to get other ones we see that\nLocal version of the market exchange it which again have the trans parents he'd say you know exactly what you're paying for and you can figure out what the low cost options for you are the other piece that and the kid he sort of touched on it stores are not\nStacking as much merchandise as they used to the event toy levels are very low um because they're driving people to on line that you may go to a break in order to start looking for something and it's simply not available\nAs serious as you mentioned Syria CEO Eddie Lambert with this hedge fund ESL Investments are have been very active keeping a series of float\nBut you know how they managed to stay open for so many years I mean they have been profitable profitable since twenty ten why keep a company running in debt for so long\nI think part of it is the fact that the IRS has long term contracts that the the brand has been around a hundred and twenty five years they have very long term contracts with the various laws that they anchor and frankly they're paying a very low cost per square foot\nFor that space if you were to you know the IRS goes away and you bring in another anchor store you could triple quadruple the amount

also\nLiquidate their Kenmore appliance outlet stores are such as the one that's located on a a highway one hundred and ... and secondly perhaps\nUh someone could uh suggest that they reconsider keeping a smaller stores opened a like a a special the hardware store or sell their appliances and they're cool line because they had very good tool\nFor John where are our guests needs to be able to respond and we're getting close to a break a pollution let's take that first part first or they are ... are in some part of Sears going to survive this\nThen facts here has sold off a number of it it's very strong ran Kenmore craftsmen and some others um because individually those brands have a lot of value\nAll right let's um uh there are some local Sears stores that are not\nOwned by Sears and you see those in some of the malls as well and that could be what John's talking about there but the second part of his question we'll continue our conversation about the demise of seniors you

the end of the civil war and uh the family was doing OK on their land in Wisconsin that they had quite a bit of family in the area there was a school nearby that Mary had started attending and and Laura went to it briefly\nUm so a lot of that a sort of warm family feeling that you get from little house and the big woods was in fact a very much a part of their lives\nI'm Charles parents live nearby um some of his siblings\nUh so it's interesting that he then sets off um to Kansas\nOr where they ended up eventually um and where they did not on land\nUm and that experience or was actually quite dangerous for the family um when Charles learned that uh the land in Wisconsin that he had owned was not going to be paid for by the farmer who had tried to buy it he then brought the family back to Wisconsin\nUm and they again lived there for for a short period but he was really hoping I think to um to strike it rich by\nA establishing a successful wheat farm and he came to feel that he couldn't do that I'm tapping because it didn't yet have a real rode\nA close by so that may have been one of the reasons why he then took the family to Minnesota\nRight that they moved a lot that by the time Laura was Eighteen she had walked away from at least a dozen homes why was the family off and on the move or was this part of the link style\nWell they just encountered a difficulties and disasters everywhere they went to I mean this is\nUm the book skip a very kind of um secure view of the family life in some ways they emphasize that um the success of of Charles angles as a provider because because Laura really wanted to memorialize her parents\nIn these books she tended to kind of glossed over anything that took away from that view um but in reality they were really I'm searching for land that they could hold onto and they really a\nFailed and many of these places in Kansas\nUm they had to leave because the land may have been too expensive to buy in Minnesota they they suffered this terrible misfortune during the um grasshopper plague and\nUh Charles was forced to sell that land they then went to a Iowa which was kind of a disastrous period for the family um the the children had meals there which may have contributed to uh marry later becoming blind\nUm so it really was kind of one thing after another and the difficulty of\nTrying to hang on to land as a farmer when you were completely under capitalized when you didn't have enough money to fall back on a was just a devastating relate to the family\nWe're talking with author Caroline Fraser she writes

network Facebook page\nLet's go to Barbara who joins us from Janesville now Hi Barbara go ahead\nAnd morning this is a very interesting subject um I started reading learning was wild or when I was seven years old I had a better the books books for red to all of my children\nI'm over the years I have visited all of the home sites that Kansas there really wasn't all\nPermanent home built there but I'm\nOne of the uh your guest had mentioned they left Kansas for financial reasons as I recall the books relate that they left Kansas because that was still an Indian Territory and hadn't been open for settlement\nUm the the other as she was saying discrepancies between the real and um the versions\nThere was no mention in the book the little house books\nAbout their time and Burr Oak Iowa\nWhich would have to actually the basis for the television show and I would suspect that part of that was it was another difficult time for the family but also\nThat's where they lost a child and they let let them borough so all of those things probably in by I Would recommend anyone who is the Laura Ingalls Wilder fan\nTo that ah the final home that that she and now man so had in Mansfield, Missouri I did that several years ago\nAnd it's interesting to see the house that al ... built and and he added on to it um I'm tall person [laughter] you don't mind the wash dishes in her things and then the house that I'm their daughter\nHad going for them and they lived in for a bit but then moved back to the original house\nI'm like I said if you're a fan of Lara you need to see that\nWell ... thank you so much for those insights let's get Caroline to jump in here first leaving Kansas help us help us with that a detail\nThe the Kansas story is fascinating because as as your the barber was mentioning the family was living on Osage a land Indian Territory was was in Oklahoma but I'm the land and not belong to the settlers\nCharles angle didn't own the piece of property that he built his little house on um they were in fact squatters and part of what was a very\nUm powerful squad or move that are in Kansas which was known as the ... state because all these people had all these white settlers had poured into these areas hoping\nOpen them for a\nFor settlement and in fact the government did so I'm very shortly after uh the angles left um and the the reason though that that to\nOr by the paralysis that he was left with\nUm and then she has another child who died shortly thereafter a and their house burned down the same month as that happened and that was really the end uh for them in terms of Dakota Territory they set off on on\nA travelling they stayed with family in Minnesota than they went for a short period to Florida they were really searching for some place to live where A L man's could recover\n'em and eventually they they would end up in Mansfield, Missouri and the American south where where they would spend a much of the rest of their lives so\nIt really is it is kind of a tragic story in many ways a but the remarkable thing is the way in which\nUm they recovered a specially Laura would just be tireless and seeking out a ... a new kinds of jobs and things that she could do to earn money she would take in boarders she waited on tables\nUm she uh became very active in women's clubs\nUh started writing a column for a farm newspaper and in these ways she was able to make\nFamily and that at that point she really gets going with her writing\n[noise] yeah you know that whole period when she was writing for the Missouri rural asked uh what is really a kind of apprenticeship she did that for around ten years at the same time her daughter rose is becoming a journalist and San\nFrancisco and and urging her again and again to write down her stories because I think rose had heard the stories as a child many times and recognize their commercial potential\nSo uh as Laura is writing her column she sometimes\nSneaking in little yet some anecdotes about her childhood which are really interesting to compare to the books because we see a her father come up and Mary I'm so that's really her apprenticeship as a writer and then\nUh when she's retiring from farming\nAh around the edge of a fix the um this is one the great depression happens and in order to try to ensure that they can hang on to their land in Missouri she sits down and write a memoir\n... we are exploring the truth conditions that Laura Ingalls Wilder lived through her little house books autobiographical novels they didn't detect the truth telling of Wilder's

in the uh late Eighteen or seventies and and early um [noise]\nUh early eighties and seventies actually and and one of the things that it's so fascinating about that story that Laura told is that she fictionalized um because her father actually could have had nothing to do\nWith the the vigilante party that she was talking about\nUm we actually think that the vigilantes\nAre were were made up and fictionalized and became one of these uh sort of stories that was repeated over and over again in the yellow press\nOf the time and nobody actually knows who the vendors were or what happened to them they they escaped successfully and and so all we really know about them is a little bit about their victims ah one of the things that's been discovered recently is that\nUh one of the victims of the vendors was in fact a neighbor a of the angles which is an interesting\nUh thing and perhaps they knew about that perhaps they learned about it\nBut one of the the really funny things about Laura telling that story is that uh she told it in the context and saying oh this is one of the things I couldn't put in my books because it was too scary for children\nAnd then she goes on to tell the story which was in fact quite horrifying um\nBut she fictionalized considerably and and sort of made it into a tall tale\nLarry how did you go about teaching from these books\nAll we when we were covering a period in history or we just get them out and read what they're you know fast foods\nAnd a distrust of you know what was going on and all you know showing how ... was really an economic colony of the ease of all the industrialization and ...\nBut call was the victim really uh you know prices shut or the material to machinery and stuff like that suddenly you can also have to pay the prices will be used for his crops was really interesting book by rose Wilder is freelance\nKind of material much more than or you know it was your whole group of people out there uh worked so hard and my mom was absolutely young\nWell Larry thank you so much for the call Caroline get into this conversation about rose Wilder lane Lawrence daughter and I don't know how she was a controversial figure\nYeah she was an amazing a character in her own rate I'm sort of a very driven and ambitious um and and had a huge uh uh impact on her mother because she again as as I said was really responsible for urging her mother\nTo um to write about her memories", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Show", "city": "Madison", "day": "12"}
