ever get on an accident because you were distracted by a smartphone or something else what happened and how did your behavior changed since then drivers ever had a run in with a distracted pedestrian when you have the right of way tell us about that\nAnd have you noticed an increase the number of pedestrians distracted by their smartphones\nWhy do you think people aren't more aware of dangers inherent in sharing the road with cars eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas at WNPR dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings\nDavid ... is director of the Wisconsin department of transportation bureau of Transportation Safety David good morning and welcome to the morning show\nGood morning and thank you for having me\nWhen we when we think about distracted pedestrians what is that we're talking about\nWhat we're talking about people walking or even riding bicycles technically they're pedestrians that are not paying attention to what they're supposed to be doing their got their face in their phone head down and they're not paying attention to what's going on around them\nPretty tough to ride a bicycle that while you're often moving pretty quickly or pedestrians I'd seen people reading books and walk into light poles in fact I think I did that once myself what other ways are there to be distracted besides our devices\nWell you can just be not paying attention you could be deeply a thought it's just a matter of you know being aware of your surroundings especially as a pedestrian you're vulnerable road user and you have no protections that just so important that you pay attention to what's going on around you\nBesides the obvious so maybe being struck by a car what other kinds of dangers are there for distracted pedestrians\nStephanie ... is an author and licensed mental health counselor her new book is gas lighting recognized manipulative and emotionally abusive people and break free Stephanie welcome to the morning show\nThank you so much time so we heard the term gas\nSliding thrown alone around a lot lately especially in the realm of politics let's start out by a defining our terms what do we mean by gas lighting\n... behaviors and they were designed to keep you off kilter and questioning your reality at the ultimate goal is to get control over you and make your dependent on the gas fighter\nSo where did we get this term\nThis tournaments originally from Nineteen thirty four play which turned into a famous Nineteen forty four movie gas light\nUm directed by George cook or so this is a movie about a person that\nThe husband tries to make the wife go crazy basically by changing a different things the environment and denying it so changes the gas lights make 'em flicker and she said well there's the gas lights he's like no no no everything's fine so she really starts thinking that she is basically going insane and said that term became gas lighting and that's\nThe news since about the Nineteen fifties to describe this pattern of abusive behavior\nCan you give us a more contemporary example practical example of of this kind of thing in action\nSure um our presence said that what you're saying and what you're hearing is not what's real and I think that's a direct quote that's a very clear example of gas lighting a you also have people that will tell you that\nI've really blatant lies lies that you know that there's no way they can be true and when you call them out on them later they say no I never said that\nIt's a constant denying of what you're saying and doing a also it's hitting you against other people saying that other people said things about you that they didn't so what happens is you try to get away from those people and you get closer to the gas later\nThere's also a history of infidelity with the gas later they have this nurse assist they need to always get attention and when that initial have fun stage or relationship has starts waning off they'll go ahead and jump to the next person are they also tell other people you're crazy\nSo or they'll say to you everyone else knows you're crazy so when you try to go get help and talked to someone about this relationship they automatically turn it on you and say well you know why would you even go to them they already know that you're crazy so people feel like they can't get help they'll also I\nWork at trying to distance you for any relationship that takes attention off of them\nAnd ... and they will and the beginning or relationship make you feel like you're the best thing ever but then eventually fall off that pedestal they've put you on and there's no way you can get back on the pedestal and then they will do what's called the valuing you which means that you can never do any right again\nSo this is ultimately a this is ultimately about control as as you indicated right at the top you point out in the book that there isn't any significant research about gas lighting and no definition for it\nIn the American side to a psychiatric association's diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders or the DSM\n... in your opinion why do you think of gas flooding has been overlooked from a research perspective\nOnly look at diagnoses such as narcissism are cystic personality disorder borderline personality disorder anti social personality disorder also known associate apathy\nThe invaders have impart those diagnoses but I don't think we've actually looked at them as a separate name it and set of behaviors together so we've known them as part of those diagnoses but I don't think in the general public that term gasoline has been used describe these behaviors that not only happened with personality disorders but also with other people as well\nSo Stephanie what brought you to this topic why did you want to look into this\nBy specialized ADHD and I was saying a lot of couples that were coming in and where one person ADHD and the other person would say well they're the problem fixed up\nAnd they weren't taking any responsibility for their part and the relationship and\nWhen I started talking about that was pretty clear that they had these tendencies gas lighting and they would even hide their own belongings and then blame the partner for doing it even though they're the one that has their stop so it became more and more obvious that there is this a kind of depending controlling relationship going on\nAnd I really started looking at the fact that people that have ADHD or people that anxiety or depression tend to be more prone to being victims of gas lighters\nIt it seems like there are some similarities to the other disorders thing if you pointed out a narcissistic personality disorder borderline personality of but well how does gas flooding differ what are the things that distinguish it from these\nBut what makes it different is that it happens even if you don't have a personality disorder so let's say for instance you grow up with parents that were pretty dysfunctional they're addicted\nOr abusive you may have learned these behaviors as a way to survive so that when you get older into adulthood you're still using those behaviors and your relationship but you must be may not necessarily have a personality disorder that's one of the key features\nThat there is between those though is that if you have a personality disorder you feel like\nYou are okay and everyone else has a problem\nIf you picked up these behaviors because you had a gasoline parent you realize that there's something that you need the facts and you're more likely to get treatment and that's like personality disorders it's hard to get treatment for this because people don't think they have a problem that's a first step towards getting help admitting that you need help\nWe're talking with Stephanie ... and the author and licensed mental health counselor in her new book is gas lighting recognized manipulative and emotionally abusive people and\nBreak free we'd like to hear your story have you been the victim of gas loading him so tell us about it and how did you break free of it is it something you were able to identify right away did it take a while for you to realize what was going on and what impact\nDid it have on your life if you're somebody who engaged in this kind of behavior and you realize that what changed for you eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four you can email us ... ideas of WPRI dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings\nHow common is a gas lighting as uh\nPercentage was study is about as far as personality disorders that makes up about five percent of the U.S population now those are people that are diagnosed so there are many people with personality disorders that have not been diagnosed\nI ... I Would say out of the couples I work with I Would say it happens about thirty to forty percent but again keep in mind that I Do work with people ADHD depression anxiety and gas lighting relationships tend to happen more often than those populations as what I've seen in my practice\nOr there are are the numbers different by a by genders or is it pretty much an equal opportunity a disorder\nI may refer to the print out here but the chance of being a gas later actually equal cross gender so you can have a people that are abusive their female that these people are just so that our mail it there's no real dominant gender I ended up kind of abusive behavior\nOh here's a here's an idea of what would happen if I say you were to record someone gas lighting in the act and then when they lie about it later you roll the tape for them how would they react\nThey deny it even if it's recorded that's the amazing part you can have undeniable proof that someone did something they will still deny it they'll just say well you misunderstood it or that's not what happened or you know you've slices together you edited it and\nSo they've all even when faced with evidence they will they will just out and out tonight it's really astounding to see the disconnect that they have between reality and the that what they want you to believe\nOr they might call you crazy for recording them in the first place or just to use the common expression these days fake news\nRight exactly I think this is one of the ways that people gas light it this is unreal what you're saying hearing isn't real at this verifiable proof that they saw nope nope not happening you just misconstrued it and again you're right that they'll say well why did you record me anyway and you must be really paranoid and crazy to do that\nWhat are some other common situations where we might find gas lighters\nPlayers in the workplace for instance you'll have a co worker that takes credit for all your work and not\nOnly that but they also sabotage you they'll go and tell the boss that that you did things you didn't do\nI and also the boss is Ken ... at the fighters to this isn't just a boss telling you you Simon such need to do this is a boss harasses you\nAre this is a boss that really will not leave me alone and those cases is really important document what's happening here right down dates Thai as direct quotes I make sure you're not doing that on a a electronic device given to you by the office because when you leave work they will take it from you as\nSo also it's important to know your employers a handbook about what to do and you're being harassed\nAnd there's also a federal laws that protect you and cases are being ... a workplace\nWe're talking with Stephanie ... is an author and licensed mental health counselor or a new book gas flooding recognized manipulative and emotionally abusive people and break free we have some people who are starting to call will take those phone calls in a moment as our conversation continues\nBut still plenty of room for you to get in on this discussion have you been the victim of gas wedding or maybe you have been someone who who did this and you realize that and got some help how did that work for you eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four your gas lighting stories and more conversation was deafening shark is just just a hat on John ... and this is the morning show on the ideas network\nI don't know if it's because their credentials were fake or what it was but um you know it it it's tough to do it\nTo Troy thanks again for sharing your story with us Stephanie that sounds like exactly what you're writing about uh you know in your book\nEspecially the blame lies and one of the reasons why gas layers give Clinton lie to people is because it makes the other things that they're dealing not seem so bad so when you're confronted with these outlandish things of course we're going to pay attention to that but not see behind the scenes or they're sabotaging\nSold from Stevens Point emailed us to ask if you could talk about the difference between gas lighting and pathological lying\nPathological line can be part of gas fighting but a pathological liar isn't necessarily doing the other behaviors of trying to control and manipulate that's a little bit of the difference\nA pathological wires they may not you know hide things and tell you that that you are sold or things that you lost them and they may not I have as much infidelity going on but it's still a problem and it's still something that needs to be addressed in a relationship if you work with someone else a pathological liar because again it's part of being a gaffe later\nEight hundred six four to one two three four the number to call to join our conversation about gas lighting today Stephanie ... says widows and we're we're talking about what gas flooding is with the behavior looks like you know what to do about it a in a well pretty much everything connected to it\nYou know share your story with the city's hundred six four to one two three four two Stephanie do gas lawyers you know what they're doing is this a conscious behavior\nIt really depends on gas lighter so if you're in gas later with a personality disorder like we talked about narcissism or a few of antisocial\nYou think that you have this egos in tonic personality in this I'll say against egos and tonic\nAnd that means that you think that you're okay but everyone else is crazy so you're not going to seek help because of selling confront you about the ... say uh nothing's wrong you're the one that's too sensitive that's the thing they go to a live gas lawyers will tell you too sensitive\nThey get if you're a person that grew up with parents that had gasoline behaviors you may have learned how to do play in line just so you wouldn't be hurt so again you carry those behaviors into adulthood and you may not really need to use them anymore\nSo that's where you realize that you're having some behaviors are impacting your relationships and asked when you start seeking help so again we have people at the gas behaviors that have personality disorders\nAnd people that just learn those behaviors when they're young or as a coping mechanism\nIs one thing that Troy so that I wanted to follow up on and that is you described the person who was engaging in this gas loading behavior you suspected that they were intimidated by him or they ah they thought they were maybe jealous of his talent and didn't realize how talented they were\nUh do we often see gas flooding behavior from people who suspect they may be in theory or even if they're not\nYes gas lighters want to be the center of attention that there's any one that is dry more attention because of their abilities they will do whatever they can to bring that person down so they can be the now the center of attention\nWhen does standard manipulation which against all of us do to one extent or another be cross the line into gas lighting\nWell there's influence using all sorts of different arenas in life but when the influence turns into using this to control people that's the issue\nSo advertising for instance the purposes and control you is to sell you an item but when you're in a gas lighting relationship or the gasoline co worker or they're trying to basically burned everything down to the ground they want you to to suffer and\nThat's not just influence that's abuse\nLet's talk about identifying just flooding behavior you have a list of behaviors in your book and it's pretty extensive but let's talk about the major ones that people should look out for\nOne of hitting you against other people so telling you that so and so said something about you and instead of going to that person and saying hey the gas layer said you said this\nYou just get mad at that person and that's exactly what the gas later once they want you to be mad at someone so you align with the gas later and said that's called splitting they'll see this\nThing called triangulation or they'll tell you to give a message to someone else so you go ahead and send that message\nThat and then the gas fields denied ever told you to say that to the other person so it's kinda crazy making behavior and\nAgain the idea is they want people to get upset with you and so the gas while just sit back and watch this drama unfold and they get kind of a high off knowing that they cause the drama\nAnd they also a gamble tell people that you're crazy they'll tell people that no one's gonna leave you if you say something because again these people look very pulled together and they can appear to be really in a decent people\nSo I got really important why you need to document I also want to mention too that if you leave a gas lighter again you need to go no contact with this person because things will never get better with this person and sometimes at work you have to wind up leaving her job that's unfortunate and unfair\nBut sometimes that's the way that you get away from the costs and tormented gas later or as Troy was saying\nThat he just tried to nine feet into it and when gas lighters get bored with the response or you're not responding they tend to move on to another victim\nLet's take a quick call before a break and we might do stuff and you have to get your response after uh that let's go to jail in Milwaukee and don't will ask you to be as brief as you can\nSay yes hello\nYeah go ahead okay yes um I was a victim of yesterday to show that\nUh kinda used to tell a little bit of lies um true my family and my kids and it ended up to be a pretty bad situation so I did end up divorcing\nHim but I mean to find out that it's so true what you're you're I guess just saying that they do try to manipulate and control\nAnd now it just it it's a sad situation because now I see him that he's like the loneliness man\nEver and he can never apologize more than for me to forgive him but I just learned that the lies that he used to say about me that it's never show and then\nPut a letter than for beach in my family and I\nBecause they ended up leaving him after a little while and\nAnd you can share and being married I kind of had this they know I haven't been with this so\nAll right ... thank you so much for sharing your story with us we'll get Stephanie's reaction and just a moment you could do share your story where there's an eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four\nSeventies

Wisconsin party candidate for governor of Wisconsin and a business IT strategist\nArnie welcome to the morning show I think he John\nWhy do you want to be governor of Wisconsin\nA that's a good question um well it's for a lot of different reasons but when they really get down to it it's about\nUh the stories that we tell ourselves and and the stories I used to tell myself to about what our society is and what our shared experiences are and how those stories haven't worked very well for us of late or things like if you work hard you'll get a had things like ah\nMy kids are going to have it better than how habit or things like a constantly growing the economy is good for us\nUh but these things are problems that we\nThat the the stories don't work for us like they used to anymore uh and\nWe're kind of getting away from believing that what we have is gonna um give us a future that we want so my kids aren't going to have a better than I had at our democracy is really not working\nFor me it's working for corporate interests our economy's really only interested in profits not necessarily in the planet that we all share so basically I Want to run because these stories are the ones that we talked about in our public life or not the ones that we talked about in politics and I think\nThat we have to start talking about them that are systems not really working in our stories are working and we have to do something different if we were really want to address them\nWhat is the Wisconsin party\nOf but we have to pay for the things that we use today we can't\nAnd I hate this term kick the can down the road because people use it all the time but we do that we do that in our personal lives and we get into trouble we do it as a society as a government we get into trouble so I'm a big believer that we have to take care of or if a structure and we have to pay for all of our current revenue streams for stuff\nWhat about uh what about the fact that so many vehicles these days are are ... are coming into a use that that don't use any gasoline they have ah they're all electric or maybe their hybrids and so you know those people are using the highways putting a lot of models on but not paying attacks how do we capture a funding for roads from those folks\nWill still living in a Appleton, Wisconsin a we have a wheel tax right now they got put into place to help pay for the roads are we used to have an assessment that would go if you're going to redo a road in front of a house within the city of Appleton but they ... the city changed how we do stuff so now\nWhen we register vehicles every year we have to pay five dollars per we'll for a a wheel tax and we can do stuff like that as well um I think\nSince we're talking about enough a structure we really have to also think about where we want to invest for the long term we have a economy and if a structure that's based upon the transportation grade that uses a lot of energy if we're really going to deal with things like climate change down the line we have to cut the way that we use\nA Petro gases and into the oils that we use it results in too much carbon dioxide as well as other pollution issues in urban areas so forget I\nThink about dealing with that problem we should also look at how we should do transportation differently how we should think about urban planning differently how we should look to find different ways to\nUh to pay for that infrastructure as well because the model that we're using is going to be evolving over the next twenty thirty forty years\nAnd when you talked about infrastructure that's a thirty to fifty your time horizon should start talking about that now we shouldn't just assume it's going to keep on being the same way it's always been with her interstate highway system with our local roads\nWe also know that health care is on the minds of a lot of people in Wisconsin and well that's a pretty broad subject so let's try and narrow it down a little bit if elected what would you change given the current state of the healthcare system in Wisconsin\nRight well the first thing is is much like Tony ... I'd like to take the ah federal money to expand access for Wisconsin families that don't have access to health coverage right now uh but to me again that's a big issue and there's also the pre existing condition thing and this is\nThe stuff I sing with ... number one issue most people in Wisconsin\nHave concerns with right now but but I think our\nHealth care is fundamentally broken and what I'd like to do is talk about it in the larger context\nAnd that we really should look at stuff like single payer within the state of Wisconsin even if the federal government's not going to do it\nAnd and the reason being is that within Wisconsin or within the United states we have almost one in five dollars goes towards health care costs according to numbers that were just released last year from the CD which is a group of ... thirty two countries that have market based a democratic system\nThe average cost devoted to health care is all those other nations with outcomes are and the bottom quarter in general across all the different measures for health so\nTo me that just speaks to how wrong and broken or health care system is in a self working at the edges around its access to health insurance we shouldn't go and deal with it had on and look at major structural overhauls for health care system\nAnd other big issue up perennially in elections is education what would you if elected work toward for our K. twelve schools and what challenges do you think they face\nOh there's a lot of challenges in the space um uh the nature of our whole job environment or not that that's the only thing that's kitchen is useful for the nature of our society is changing yet we're still using them out all those came to the United states or the ... the nineteenth century and Nineteen fifties or so\nIt's based upon depression model it's all about uh having people be obedient and essentially good real take risen to conform to systems\nAnd while I Would like to do if I get elected governor would be to establish a blue ribbon commission\nThat would look at reforming our whole educational system from the ground up we have to ask ourselves the questions that we asked are wrestling with the W. system about the Wisconsin Idea and how can education best serve the state of Wisconsin the people within it and to do that I think we have to redo her whole healthcare system sorry excuse me our whole educational system\nI'm right now again it's that pressure model but we need to\nFollow it I called the four seats for things we have to teach creative thinking we have to teach critical thinking we have to teach better communication we have to teach our students and ourselves how to collaborate better those are the skills we need to have a high functioning society it adaptable society\nAnd that's not what we get our educational system today\nArnie ends as the Wisconsin party candidate for governor of Wisconsin we're talking with him today as part of our series of interviews with\nPeople running for governor in the state uh let's talk about Foxconn because that's been in the news a lot for the last year if elected what would you do about this Fox ... what's your take or would you or renegotiate the deal if you could\nEither renegotiate that thing in a heartbeat um I'd call up Matt Flynn and see what he was doing because he was the guy that said he had to plan on exactly how you could legally ah kill the deal with Foxconn uh to me it's just a bad idea it's four point five billion dollars\nWorth of subsidies and credits that will be given to a foreign a trans national corporation in order to put jobs in Wisconsin that aren't necessarily the kinds of jobs are a long term sustainable or pass for Wisconsin\nI'm an IT guy I'm a technology guy right so a screens an LCD is you know ten years from now they might be gone of so many tech companies change so much over time it's ridiculous [noise] who knows Fifteen Twenty years from now we might be using things like ... or different foreign factors for interface with\nA visual a site from systems are inputs into systems were going to spend four point five billion dollars it's like going to Las Vegas\nAnd putting all your money on red number three spin the wheel and hoping that the number Lance they're a little bit of math for a while back to Wisconsin that Seventy two counties four point five billion dollars would be sixty two million dollars for each county\nFor doing investment and new businesses are stars that are sustainable their base in Wisconsin there are widely distributed yet jihad geographically I mean\nIf you had to choose which one would you choose it or if you had to say which will you invested in as an investor know almost every investor would say take the distributed risk that like a safe place one thing that like that so to me Foxconn is just a ridiculous thing those very politically motivated\nAnd I don't think it's good for Wisconsin I don't think it's good for the citizens of Wisconsin\nAnd it is with us in Janesville kind of go ahead\nOh what about the problem of throwing away or vote I'm voting for you to get the worst personal life stuff\nOK Kenneth we are almost out of time or people might say vote for that Wisconsin party as a throne as a vote thrown away a what how do you respond to that\nWell we have to start changing somehow fried and uh I I understand people that I think people should vote their conscious but it's not just choosing between two different systems that spoke being able to\nChange your system overall then that would be proportional representation over time we keep on going down this road voting for one of the two major parties are systems are never going to change eroded ever got to be change we're just going to keep on getting more of the same\n... and it's not just about voting where I Am to do was after the election on November seventh coupon to keep on working on these things through things like Wisconsin party tried to have that be a part of a larger movement that will continuously work to reform or electoral process\nAs well as our government rules and regulations as well as\nAre the critical issues of our art is that we haven't talked about yet which to me is climate change in the shorter runway that we have left in order to really address that fundamentally so voting for what are the two parties is is going to get some more of the same if you're happy with that vote for Scott Walker flipped Tony Evers and do it with a good conscious\nIf you're not happy with the system and the way things work today you have to start behaving differently and that includes voting for a third party\nAnd do you think we're ready for that\nI think we have to be ready for that look how many people are unhappy with either party and look at how come of politicians are looked at it as being a slam a used car salesman or anything like that but we have a lower rate in\nIt than what a used car sales and have people think politicians are not good people and part of that is because of how corrupt the system is\nServing in government and being a leader should be about service leadership it should be a privilege it should be stuff that we all feel called to do with a trivia honorable thing\nAnd we should be ... dialogue around that we should have the best and brightest in our society a step forward to help lead us into work through the major issues in the stories are working in our society today\nSo it again if you keep on doing what we're doing are doing is reinforcing the special interest groups that are current to party political systems\nAlright and Ernie I think that's a good place for us to leave in ... Wisconsin party candidate for governor Wisconsin and a business IT strategist thank you so much for joining us this morning thank you John\nTo hear more candidates interviews or see coverage of the campaign visit Wisconsin voted out or we'll continue our gubernatorial candidate interviews Wednesday with independent candidate Maggie Turnbull\nHow many farms do they visit and and how often\n[noise] so they visit Nineteen uh Eighteen today team dairy farms are each semester um so I get a new group of students each semester so we go to two or three farms a day\nAnd and how many how many faculty and staff are involved in this program as well\nUm so I'm faculty for me to you to bail Claire and as I stated a Dale ... who is a she's a ... a lecture for Spanish language she comes along\nWe have another interpreter a Mercedes Fox that comes with us and then we have a public health nurse from either one of the public health departments come with us\nSo the size and scope of the farms are students who are these all of the large operation dairy farms or you're still visiting some smaller farms as well\nWe do see some smaller fires they're mostly I Would say middle sized family farms the average um number ... tell you about seven hundred so they're fairly large um and have some employees we see both local employees as well as the I emigrated place\nWe used to ... an associate professor of you know when you clear also a family nurse practitioner and she helped develop the partners in health program\nWhat questions do you have about this program and maybe you live in rural Wisconsin and you'd like to know more about what they're doing it you know Claire and maybe share the stories of the you might have been challenges you face in rural Wisconsin\nUm accessing a health care in your area you hundred six more two one two three four hundred six four to\nOne two three four\nOf at least so what do what are the most common health problems were farmers and farm workers that you've seen in Wisconsin [noise]\nOh I Would say you know it in dairy and say we see a lot of um muscular skeletal problems um just because it's repetitive nature of the work in the lifting that goes into it\nUm other than that I mean it's just kind of usual every day problems workers really don't have a resource um many of them to ask questions about health um so we're there for them\nBeyond medical care what else to the student students learn\nWell students learn so much about Hispanic culture we do um as well as about immigration as well as the agriculture so nursing is the largest sector of the health care workforce a will encounter farmworkers throughout their career no matter where they are there\nSo we spent five weeks before we go out to the sites where we talk about agricultural health and safety\nUh we talk about immigration we talk about Hispanic culture I'm as well as some of the little things about screening and and immunizations I'm so they learn a lot about\nA culture that's in their backyard that off and many of them don't know is there\nHow ... how important is this experience for each student going into the health care industry mean this is the takes place first semester of their final your schools are there\nYou know basically what nine months away from launching themselves into the workforce in the healthcare industry how important is this experience for them\n[noise] well I personally think it's a really important and I certainly enjoy reading their self reflection that at the end of this semester how much it's actually changed their I guess perspective of agriculture as well as of rural culture as well as of\nImmigration and Hispanic culture so like I said they'll be able to take this and what ever setting there and so whether they're in the ER or public how they're going to experience um members of this population as they go through their career\nAnd uh how many of the uh how many of the people that come into your program were Spanish speakers themselves\n[noise] um I Would say it varies so some semesters this semester we have all Spanish minor students um and some semesters we have maybe half Spanish minors\nSo they get that opportunity then to use their Spanish language skills along with their nursing skills\nSaid to be able to buy and that is amazing for them\nUm we do have interpreters with us so students who don't speak Spanish\nDo still have the opportunity to participate and I think it's really important to learn how to use interpretation services I mean that's kind of a learned thing it sounds like it'd be really easy but you're actually talking to the patients rather than talking to the interpreter that makes sense\nThat makes perfect sense and I would imagine that over time they become more accustomed to the language in may or may be blue speaking up to get by on their own\nOh yeah absolutely so students you know ... are encouraged to learn phrases and you know it's amazing how well we get humans can communicate without speaking another language you know so it's all about a body language how you approach people having a caring presence\nUm so yeah a lot of them and it's nice to see them a lot of our students like this semester I'm seeing if three of our students that it emotions in Mexico\nAnd three that that Americans in Costa Rica and it was right near there who is very many of our workers are so they're able to have conversations you know about where they live or you know so that's really into\n... and how many how big is your class each year of a nursing students approximately I Know it varies\nIt varies I take it it's usually fix\nSo you you have six students and the the geographic area around Oakland or that you cover how big is that how far oh to go\nWe go to happen county and we go to buffalo county\nOkay and the people who want to find out more about your program or how can they do that\nI can certainly get me a call at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\nOkay and is there anything on your Ah yes I ... or anything on your website about it and we'll remind people about it at the end but I wanted to give people a chance to man\nMason on a version itself on a you W O Claire website um otherwise in my office number is seven five eight three six or nine one one\nAnd we'll give that information out again\nOh it's a a new program all well not actually so new it's been around since ... eleven\nThat connects a nursing students with people who need health care on our farms in the clear area wondering if you're living in rural Wisconsin what health care challenges you face at least ... stays with us you can join the program at eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four It's MORNING show on

director of the Wisconsin department of transportation bureau of Transportation Safety David good morning and welcome to the morning show\nGood morning and thank you for having me\nWhen we when we think about distracted pedestrians are what is that we're talking about\nWhat we're talking about people walking or even riding bicycles technically they're pedestrians that are not paying attention to what they're supposed to be doing their got their face in their phone head down and they're not paying attention to what's going on around them\nPretty tough to ride a bicycle that while you're off and moving pretty quickly or pedestrians I'd seen people reading books and walk into light poles in fact I think I did that once myself what other ways are there to be distracted besides our devices\n[noise] well you can just be not paying attention you could be deeply a in thought it's just a matter of you know being aware of your surroundings especially as a pedestrian you're vulnerable road user and you have no protections that just so important that you pay attention to what's going on around you\nBesides the obvious so maybe being struck by a car what other kinds of dangers are there for distracted pedestrians\nLighting recognize manipulative and emotionally abusive people and break free Stephanie welcome to the morning show\nThank you so much John So we've heard the term gas sliding thrown alone around a lot of lately especially in the realm of politics let's start out by a defining our terms what do we mean by gas lady\n... theories I mean ... years and they were designed to keep you off kilter and questioning your reality at the ultimate goal is to get control over you and make it depending on the gas lighter\nSo where did we get this term\nIs ... originally from Nineteen thirty four play which turned into a famous Nineteen forty four movie gas light um directed by George cook or so this is a movie about a person that the husband tries to make the wife go crazy basically by changing a different things the environment and denying it\nSo changes the athletes make 'em flicker and she said well there's the gas life he's like no no no everything's fine so she really starts thinking that she is basically going insane and so that term became gas lighting and that's been years since about the Nineteen fifties to describe this pattern of abuse of eighth here\nCan you give us a more contemporary example practical example of of this kind of thing in action\nSure I our presence said that what you're saying and what you're hearing is not what's real and I think that's a direct quote that's a very clear example of gas lighting a you also have people that will tell you that\nI really believe in lies lies that you know that there's no way they can be true and when you call them out on the later they say no I never said that\nIt's a constant and dying of what you're saying and doing a also it's hitting you against other people saying that other people said things about you that they didn't so what happens is you try to get away from them\nThere's also a history of infidelity with the gas later they have the nurses is they need to always get attention and when that initial have fun stage or relationship has starts waning off they'll go ahead and jump to the next person and they also tell other people you're crazy\nSo or they'll say to you everyone else knows you're crazy so when you try to get help and talked to someone about this relationship they automatically turn it on you and say well you know why would you even go to them they already know that you're crazy so people feel like they can't get how they'll also I\nWork at trying to distance you from any relationship that takes attention off of them\nSo they want a hundred percent of your attention and they will and the beginning relationship make you feel like you're the best thing ever but then eventually you fall off that pedestal they've put you on and there's no way you can get back on the pedestal and then they will do what's called devaluing you which means that you can never do any right again\nSo this is ultimately a this is ultimately about control as as you indicated right at the top you point out in the book that there isn't any significant research about gas lighting and no definition for it\nIn the American side to a psychiatric association's diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders or the DSM\n... in your opinion why do you think a gas flooding has been overlooked from a research perspective\nOnly look at diagnoses such as narcissism or cystic personality disorder borderline personality disorder anti social personality disorder also known associate apathy\nThese behaviors have impart those diagnoses but I don't think we've actually looked at them as a separate name it and set of behaviors together so we've known them as part of those diagnoses but I don't think in the general public that term gasoline has been used to describe his behaviors that not only happened with personality disorders but also with other people as well\nSo Stephanie what brought you to this topic why did you want to look into this\nBy specialized ADHD and I was saying a lot of couples that were coming in and where one person ADHD and the other person would say well they're the problem fixed up\nAnd they weren't taking responsibility for their part and the relationship\nAnd when I started talking about that was pretty clear that they had these tendencies of gas lighting and they would even hide their own belongings and then blame the partner for doing it\nEven though they're the one that has their stop so it became more and more obvious that there is this a kind of depending controlling relationship going on and I really started looking at the fact that people that have ADHD or ... or depression tend to be more prone\nTo being victims of gas layers\nIt seems like there are some similarities to the other disorders thing if you pointed out a narcissistic personality disorder borderline personality but well how does gas flooding differ what are the things that distinguish it from these\nWell what makes it different is that it happens even if he don't have a personality disorder so let's say for instance you grow up with parents that were pretty dysfunctional they're addicted or abusive you may have learned these behaviors as a way to survive so that when you get older into adulthood\nYou're still using those behaviors in your relationship but you must be may not necessarily have a personality disorder that's one of the key features that there is between those though is if you have a personality disorder\nYou feel like you're OK and everyone else has a problem\nIf you picked up these behaviors because you had a gasoline parent you realize that there's something that you need the facts and you're more likely to get treatment and that's like personality disorders it's hard to get treatment for this because people don't think they have a problem that's a first step towards getting out of the admitting that you need help\nWe're talking with Stephanie ... and the author and licensed mental health ... her new book is gas lighting recognized manipulative and emotionally abusive people and break free we'd like to hear your story have you\nTell us about it and how did you break free of it is it something you were able to identify right away did it take a while for you to realize what was going on and what impact\nDid it have on your life if you're somebody who engaged in this kind of behavior\nAnd you realize that what changed for you eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four you can email us of ideas of WPRI dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings\nHow common is a gas lighting as a as a kind of behavior\nPercentage was study is about as far as personality disorders that makes up about five percent of the U.S population now those are people that are diagnosed so there are many people with personality disorders that have not been diagnosed\nI ... I Would say out of the couples I work with I Would say it happens about thirty to forty percent but again keep in mind that they do work with people ADHD depression anxiety and gas lighting relationships tend to happen more often than those populations as what I've seen in my practice\nOr there are are the numbers different by a by genders or is it pretty much an equal opportunity a disorder\nI may refer to the print out here but the chance of being a gas later actually equal cross gender so you can have a people that are abusive their female that these people are just so that our mail it there's no real dominant gender I and it's kind of abusive have here\nHere's a here's an idea of what would happen if I say you were to record someone gas lighting in the act and then when they lie about it later you roll the tape for them how would they react\nThey deny it even if it's recorded that's the amazing part you can have undeniable proof that someone did something they will still deny it they'll just say well you misunderstood it or that's not what happened\nOr you know you've places together you edited it and so they've all even when faced with have evidence they will they will just out announce deny its really astounding to see\nThe disconnect that they have between reality and the that and what they want you to believe\nOr they might call you crazy for recording them in the first place or just to use the common expression these days fake news\nRight exactly I think is is one of the ways that people gas light it this is unreal what you're saying hearing isn't real at this verifiable proof that they thought nope nope\nNot happening is misconstrued it and again you're right that they'll say well why did you record me anyway and you must be really paranoid and crazy to do that\nWhat are some other common situations where we might find gas lighters\n... players in the workplace for instance you'll have a co worker that takes credit for all your work\nAnd not only that but they also sabotage you they'll go and tell the boss that that you did things you didn't do I and also the ... of the fighters to and it's just a boss telling you you ... that you need to do this is a boss their harasses you\nUh this is a boss that really will not leave me alone and those cases is really important a document what's happening to your right down dates Thai is direct quotes I make sure you're not doing that on a electronic device given to you by the office because when you leave work they will take it from you\nSo also it's important to know your employers a handbook about what to do and you're being harassed and there's also a federal laws that protect you and cases are being employed or ask a workplace\n[noise] we're talking with Stephanie ... is an author and licensed mental health counselor her new book gas flooding recognize manipulative and emotionally abusive people and break free we have some people who are starting to call will take those phone calls in a moment as our conversation continues\nBut still plenty of room for you to get in on this discussion have you been the victim of gas\nWho did this and you realize that and got some help how did that work for you eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four your gas lighting stories and more conversation was deafening shark is just just ahead I'm John months and this is the morning show on the ideas that work\nI don't know if it's because their credentials were fake or what it was but um you know it it it's tough to do it\nTo Troy thanks again for sharing your story with us Stephanie that sounds so like exactly what you're writing about a year in a in your book\nEspecially the blame lies and one of the reasons why gas layers give ... people's because it makes the other things that they're dealing not seem so bad so when you're confronted with these outlandish things of course we're going to pay attention to that but not see behind the scenes or they're sabotaging\nSold from Stevens Point emailed us to ask you if you could talk about the difference between gas lighting and pathological lying\nPathological line can be part of gas fighting but a pathological liar isn't necessarily doing the other behaviors they're trying to control manipulate that's a little bit of the difference as\nPathological wires they may not you know hide things and tell you that that you are sold there are things that you lost them and they may not I have as much infidelity going on but it's\nStill a problem and it's still something that needs to be addressed their relationship if you work with someone else of pathological liar because again it's part of it\nEight hundred six four to one two three four the number to call to join our conversation about gas lighting today Stephanie ... says widows and we're we're talking about what gas flooding is what the behavior looks like you know what to do about it in a ... pretty much everything connected to it\nYou know share your story with the eight hundred six four to one two three four do those definitely do gas lawyers you know what they're doing is this a conscious behavior\nIt really depends on gas fighters so if you're in gas later with a personality disorder like we talked about nurses says or a few of antisocial personality disorder again that's socio apathy you'd think that you have this\nEgos in tonic personality in this all played against egos and tonic and that means that you think that you're okay but everyone else is crazy\nSo you're not going to seek out because of selling confront you about the ... say uh nothing's wrong you're the one that's\nToo sensitive that's the thing they go to a live ... too sensitive than again if you're a person that grew up with parents that\nHave ... you may have learned how to do play in line just so\nYou wouldn't be hurt so again you carry those behaviors into adulthood and you may not really need to use them anymore so that's where you realize that you're having some behaviors are impacting your relationship and that's when you start seeking help so again we have people at the gas behaviors that have personality disorders\nAnd people that just learn those behaviors when they were younger as a coping mechanism\nIs one thing that Troy so that I wanted to follow up on a notice you describe the person who was engaging in this gas letting behavior you suspected that\nThey were intimidated by him or they ah they thought they were maybe jealous of his talent and didn't realize how talented they were uh do we often see gas wedding behavior from people who suspect they may be inferior even if they're not\nYes gas lighters want to be the center of attention that there's any one that is dry more attention because of their ability is they will do whatever they can to bring that person down so they can be the now the center of attention\nWhen does standard manipulation which against all of us do to one extent or another be cross the line into gas lighting\nThere's influence using all sorts of different arenas in life but when the influence turns into using this to control people that's the issue so advertising for instance the purposes and control you is this tell you an item\nThat when you're in a gas lightning relationship or the gasoline co worker or they're trying to basically burned everything down to the ground they want you to to suffer and\nThat's not just influence that's abuse\nOr let's talk about identifying guess letting behavior you have a list of behaviors in your book and it's pretty extensive but let's talk about the major ones that people should look out for\nPlanes hitting you against other people so telling you that\nSo and so said something about you and instead of going to that person and saying hey the gas lawyer said you said this you just get mad at that person and that's exactly what the gas later once they want you to be mad at someone so you align with the gas later instead that's called splitting\nThey'll see the thing called triangulation or they'll tell you to give a message to someone else so you go ahead and send that message that and then the gas fields denied ever told you to say that to the other person so it was kind of crazy making behavior and again the idea is they want people to get upset with you and so the gasoline will just\nSit back and watch this drama unfold and they get kind of a high off knowing that they cause the drama and they also a gamble tell people that you're crazy they'll tell people that no one's going to believe you if you say something\nHis again these people look very pulled together and they can appear to be really in a decent people so I got really important why you need to document I also want to mention too that if you leave a gas lighter again you need to go no contact with this person because things will never get better with this person and sometimes at work you have to wind up leaving\nUh but sometimes that's the way that you get away from that Carson tormented gas later or as Troy was saying that he just tried to ... feet into it and gas layers get bored with the response or you're not responding they tend to move on to another victim\nLet's take a quick call before a break and we might do stuff and you have to get your response after about a let's go to jail in Milwaukee and Joel ask you to be as brief as you can\n[noise] okay yes [noise] hello\nYeah go ahead okay as um I was a victim of the guests later chew that actually he is now my ex husband kinda used to tell a little bit of lies um\nTrue my family and to my kids and it ended up to be a pretty bad situation so I did end up divorcing him but I mean it to find out that it's so true what you're\nHere I guess just saying that they do try to manipulate and control\nAnd now it just it it's a sad situation because now I see him and he's like the only man ever and he can never apologize more\nThan for me to forgive him but I just learned that the lies that have to say about me live by this never show and then put a little damper beach in my family and I because they ended up leaving him left her a little while and\nLiving here and being married I kind of has to say no I was going on with this so\nAll right ... thank you so much for sharing your story with us we'll get
