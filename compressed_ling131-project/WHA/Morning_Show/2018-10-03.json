and\nWisconsin Legislature created the ... stewardship program in Nineteen eighty nine to preserve valuable natural areas and wildlife habitat protect water quality and fisheries and expand opportunities for outdoor recreation the program is funded on a ten year cycle ended up for renewal\nHow have natural areas been part of your life what do you think is the value of programs like this eight hundred six four to one two three four\nIdeas of WNPR dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings [noise] my guess is marked a Mike Carlson executive director of gathering waters Wisconsin's alliance for land trusts Mike welcome to the morning show thinks China Morning thanks for having me on\nSo how does the noles Nelson stewardship program a work\nSure well as you mentioned the the stewardship program is nearly Thirty years old and it's been providing a really critical critical funding or to protect some of Wisconsin's most special places over that time period\nSo the stewardship program I'm actually\nNot only provides funding for the state department of natural resources to protect things like state parks and wildlife areas\nBut it also provides funding to local governments local communities as well as to a nonprofit conservation organizations such as land trust which is\nWhat our men who are members are around the state so in Wisconsin we have nearly fifty ... nearly fifty local nonprofits that really a work closely with other partners to get a land protection done and and stewardship spin a crucial program for that\n[noise] so uh how much land are we talking about in terms of what the stewardship program has been able to acquire a censored started do you have any idea yeah so\nOver over that nearly Thirty years the stewardship program itself is protected nearly five hundred thousand acres of land and I think you know for an average listener that that sounds obviously like a a really large amount I think it's worth noting that um\nI'm In both of them ended my clients' homes homes and that over the years all of that free stuff is accumulating more and more and um so now they're paying me to help them organize things that they didn't even pay for so it's become increasingly a bigger problem I see\nAnd well I mean we we accumulate a lot of clutter anyway because we just bought a lot of stuff and so if we were getting all this free stuff too that just kind of piles more and more on\nA ... ah you're seeing a lot of this uh what do people say when you tell him gee whiz you really need to get rid of this stuff [noise]\nThey're always saying look I didn't want this I don't know what to do with it but I just feel badly throwing it away and so now they're trying to figure out oh\nI Want to do something responsible with this I don't want to just throw it away but they've already got you know sixteen water bottles and reusable bags and enough T shirts you know for\nA twelve people or let alone for and so you know they just have a really hard time partying with it and um but they don't need it they realize they don't want it and um so now we try I just tried to help them\nFind a way I'm In a good place for somebody else to use it to 'em or to recycle them when\nWe yeah I I tend to notice that most of my free stuff ends up in the trunk of my car because I mostly go to the golf tournaments and about once a year I just throw it all away and I think what I've started doing is just dumping it in the dumpster on the way out of the golf course\nBut we just it's everywhere I mean you you you can't really go anywhere without somebody saying here have a pen have this have that um and I don't really need any of this of doing\nAll right well so what I'm trying to think about um in my column was to just start a conversation like this one about you know holistically thinking about all of this free stuff that's available and whether or not um you know it at the supply level whether or not this is all making sense\nWhen we're all trying to be more\nResponsible consumers and be more environmentally responsible and so I was just trying to think like OK we get these things from camp so we get these things are sports events\nAnd charities who want our donations or getting them everywhere and and is it okay for us to just say no well it definitely is but we often don't and um and so like you said all of this stuff either ends up in the landfill\n'em or you know a lot of us are donating them to charities um both at home and abroad and\nYou know there is no doubt that there is a need for these things I'm a little bit in the United states and also in places like Latin America and and in Africa and places um where some of these thrift stores and other places will donate things\nBut even they are not realizing that there's too much of this stuff and they don't even want it so we're kind of flooding the market\nAnd um you know so I just wanted to start a conversation about whether or not at the production level you know do we really need these things for marketing and could companies and nonprofits and other organizations sort of rethink the freebie\nSo why do we take the stuff I mean is it just like we we feel guilty of we don't someone offers or something and it's not polite to say you know I really don't want the ah why do we take I mean I\nThink that we think there'll be useful and I think that sometimes we feel guilty or sometimes we think oh well of course you know\nUm [noise] this is great I have a new kind of have a new shirt I didn't have to pay for it but the problem is is of course we get home and realize we have enough shirts we have enough tens and we don't need these things but right it seems like a good deal\nAnd you know somebody's offering this stuff and it seems are rude\nTo maybe decline it and um\nAnd sometimes we don't even have a choice it's just coming into our house so I've seen with my kids and in my clients' homes you know their kids come home from camps and from sporting events and they've got new tote bags and new lunch bags and hats and T shirts and all of these things so sometimes we're not even given the choice\nUm but yeah I mean I think there's a certain amount of guilt or you're feeling badly about turning it down and also we think like oh well certainly we can make use of this but then of course we don't\nAnd then there are all of those ... of mailing labels that you get from various a nonprofit groups I think that we probably have an entire dreadful about\nAt our house we'd have to send you know hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pieces of mail over the next ten years just to use of what we have no right\nAnd guess what people are spending less mail right so um this is a really big um source of free stuff or you know coming into our home and it's something I wasn't able to touch on it in my article um just because of space but that a lot of readers then followed up with me and said why do I keep getting all of these address labels\nWhy they send me these tote bags why do they some of these T shirts that don't fit why are they sending me pad the paper I don't need I Would rather have them use 'em\nYou know my money and my donations for things for their cars and not um you know sending me you know greeting cards and all of those things and you're right in this era of us all doing more things\nUm electronically we don't need those address labels and um you know there's every day I mean almost every day in my household I get a mailing that includes\nOne of those so I turned on I'm On my email but then I couldn't get him off\nThe [laughter] exactly exactly\nOkay so the um ... but it isn't just companies and so where you you you often even she understands boxes of free stuff a garage or yard sales\nOh definitely definitely I mean well those can be [laughter] those are dangerous for other reasons um garage sales and things like that I'm for people to collect things that\nTreasures while when they're there and they just can't resist than they bring home and then find that they don't really want 'em\nBut that's a whole another story but but yeah I mean I just um I guess I just wanted to start a conversation about you know things like okay we um [noise] you know water bottles we all have these ... little water bottles now and we think oh this is so great for the environment we're not using the single\nUse plastic water bottles but then we seem to be creating another problem in that these plastic reusable water bottles are almost like a disposable item because there there are so many of them and the same goes for reusable shopping bags you know like you go to the store there\nNinety nine cents okay I'll buy another one I can throw away my other one you know I can they're ... they become almost\nA new problem and that they um they have a sort of increased the bulls water bottles reusable water base and things like that are reusable shopping bag um and that now we've created new problem in that these things are disposable now and um\nAnd so it's just worry that and I mean yes we can we use them yes there are ways to and use plastic water bottles that you reduce shopping bags and a lot of other\nWays but still we seem to be sort of flooding the market um with these things and creating a whole nother problem because they're either free or ... or inexpensive\nAnd half the time you get to the store and realize you up the bag home anyway\nRight and then when you do you buy another one yet another one that's right and then people\nAre like oh I have all these reusable shopping bags and I don't know how to store them and I never use them and I always forget that so um I just thought you know we there was this recent effort um you know that everybody's heard about trying to reduce the use of um or eliminate altogether\nOn single use plastic straws you know and not just got me to thinking like that caught on and had such momentum but like what about all these other things that are sort of now considered disposable and and that we're not otherwise um thought of as disposable in the past\nWell it ... you know we just it seems to me what you're asking us to do is to just be a lot more mindful about what we bring into the house in the first place and and uh and then you know do we need it well don't take it then and\nI really think about whether you needed or or whether you don't um I think what we what we should do is I'm\nA have a discussion about what to do okay so this stuff all came into her house now you know would we do with it how do we do clutter our house we were going to get to that on the other side of our news break\nAnd as we continue our discussion I'm and I'm Wondering what our listeners take do you find yourself being buried under a mountain of free stuff you always take it when it's offered let us know what you think about that at eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four what do you do with all this stuff eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas WPRI dot org or tweet us a WPRI mornings\nUh Nicole ... is a freelance writer for the Washington Post an owner of a neat Nick of Washington DC\nBased professional organizing service hey she's originally from Wisconsin oh good for that to a recent piece for the Washington Post is I declare homes for a living and I hate free stuff we're talking about free stuff and what we should do with it\nWondering what you think eight hundred six four to one two three four it's a morning show on the ideas network [noise]\nNicole you hear this kind of thing a lot from clients where people get really creative with some of the stuff they do\nUm yeah I mean I think people um you know we sort of try to think together and often actually our kids can help us come up with great ideas but um you know I think that there is sort of um an exhaustion level right that all of a sudden hits us all because it's like oh we have so much stuff\nWe're constantly going through it we're constantly trying to downsize we're constantly trying to um\nYou know move things in and out of our house in a way\nI'm that's not only responsible but also helpful to the way we live so people just feel like a little bit exhausted by it all and so I always just try to think with them um you know about about what we can do um [noise] that will both um\nYou know both help them and getting rid of what they need but also potentially help somebody else so [noise] um\nThere's a lot of people who want this stuff to go to sort of its highest purpose\nAnd I think that that's um [noise] uh you know really admirable you know and so we do try to think creatively 'em but sometimes you know I mean right as creatively as we think and even if we're you know we're donating these things some places may not want whatever it is they may not\nWant 'em a portfolio embossed with a company's name they may not want a magnet or a key chain or whatever\nUm and then I just urge them that the thing to do is maybe they just take it to a local dump 'em so that they can dispose of it properly whether it's metal or an electronic something or you know something like that so not just maybe tossing it in your trash can but like taking it somewhere where they can dispose of it in a more environmentally friendly way\nIs a is it also worth noting that for some people who may be struggling just reach those might be something they rely on I mean we're not trying to demonize anyone here\nNo not at all and as I said earlier there is definitely a need 'em and I don't want to minimize that at all\nSort of um things that I work with clients on is um you know only donating things and giving things to charities and to um nonprofits that they that people will really benefit from and use and there's no doubt that there is a need\nIn both the United states and an eight countries um elsewhere in the world so I don't want to minimize that it's just that even those organizations are feeling sort of over run by the stuff you know and um and even though we all want to donate you know things that are\nUm nice and clean and wearable and useful um\nYou know the fact is is some of the things just um aren't useful or desired by the people who need them and so\nThere's just sort of um [noise] they're the you know we're just producing so much stuff at this point that um [noise] you know it's just hard to get to give away and um you know but but definitely you know I I think as much as we can\nYou know donate to places um who needed and who will distribute it to those that need\nSo I'm curious Nicole how you got into the ... of helping people organize their that's uh that's something I Would really like to know\n[noise] yeah so I started my business about twelve years ago\nUm I um I sort of have always been a very organized person\nAnd I I had been working I'm In politics and in Washington DC especially where there's a lot of people who work long days and I'm Still in sort of have time to do some of the things that need to be done around their house they may be\nDual income families with where you know the mom and dad are both working and they have young children and they're working full time and they\nSort of are barely you know maintain um their regular sort of a lives and so I just I realized that there was maybe I'm a a a a place where it could be helpful to people to help them organize their homes\nUm things that they just maybe could do if they had enough time or maybe just aren't adept at doing 'em\nAnd so I just started you know talking to people and I've done everything from organizing\nKitchens to play rooms to closets to helping people move 'em I just think in this you know fast paced a world we're all living in you know some of these other things can sort of be pushed aside um but that if you're home is organized um it can be\nUm you know make your life easier I'm On an everyday basis and\nUm you know can help everybody just feel um like the house is running more efficiently and um and more um [noise] yeah and it's just more organized so I just sort of you know I started and I think in the past couple of years\nUm I mean really for the entire time but um people are really starting to rethink you know what is coming into their homes\nWhat they need how they can be more environmentally friendly how they can live with less\nUm and sort of just reevaluating I'm there the the purchases they make and also all of this free stuff that just ends up in their house\nWilling in a much not even get started on all the things we're inheriting from our parents these\nOh [laughter] yeah whether or not get started it really I'm right I'm you know that's a whole nother thing right I mean a lot of the stuff that our parents thought and that was so valuable at the time I'm or things that people um of a younger generation aren't\nAnd um you know are hard to sort of figure out what to do with as well yes I help people with that um a lot\nOf doubt it could be a reality show what's this painting doing in my house [laughter] right\nOr the beautiful old you know secretary gas can run that is lovely and I really um you know I I think it's so beautiful but I just you know my my laptop doesn't really fit\n[laughter] okay our borders are who's less organized people from Wisconsin or people from DC\nOh my gosh\nYou know ... on that earnestly I think that\nYou know there are just starting to people everywhere and there are organized people everywhere but um but you know you really have to sort of take the time to think about some of this stuff and more and more families are just so I'm busy and living such hectic lies that some of these things can fall by the wayside so that's when they call me to sort of how\nWell we we have a hectic our here on the on the morning show we'll continue our discussion with Nicole and zero the owner of a Washington based professional organizing

Madison Laura welcome to the morning show\nThanks for having me\nAmazon recently announced that it will pay all of its us employees of minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour starting November first how significant is this for a company like Amazon\nWell this is a\nHuge a moment I think for for directly for that three hundred and Seventy five thousand workers will impact their incomes right away but also symbolically I'm at the challenge to other\nUh retailers um and I and other leading companies just about how\nThe people at the very bottom of their wage structures are treated and um and how we really moved towards more shared their country\nDo you do you think that there will be a a a ripple effect for a decisions like this that others will follow suit we've already seen a Walmart um uh increase of what it pays its a minimum wage employees target I Believe is also done so we're seeing some moving in that direction so is there a ripple effect\nThe issue by workers ... led by workers around the issue of wages in in different settings um the five Fifteen started in twenty twelve when New York fast food workers\nUm demanded higher wages for their work in fast food restaurants in Manhattan\nAnd then it spread across the country so that is changing the way of more than forty million people but you can see that as you know the organization the organizing in Milwaukee was a workers saying look if we're going to have a big in public investment\nIn the stadium we should expect\nDecent jobs out of it and will not negotiate with the bucks over how to stop and look that's um I think the place where the the organizing an activism is going on is that workers who are in these jobs are standing up and say I cannot make my life work in this work\nUm and I mean we need to be the way to think [noise]\nSo do let's talk about what kind of economic sense this made for the bucks I mean I I'm really hesitate to assign altruism to corporations but um what's the what's in this for the Milwaukee Bucks\n[noise] well um I\nI Would say that the bugs are\nWhile they're a private corporation and they make a lot of private money there have been on numerous public investments in it most notably in the ...\nThe infrastructure of the stadium and um that means that there is a public commitment altruism but they understand that uh\nThey're an important they have been invested in to be an economic development driver and in downtown Milwaukee and that the quality of the jobs that stadium are as important to that economic driver position that it plays as um\nAs you know as the salaries are going to pay their players\n[noise] mhm [noise] um let's take a phone call we got two callers who want to join our discussion Mary Kay in Kenosha is one of them will go to Mary Kay first good morning Mary Kaye thanks for joining us said\nMorning I'm ... I'd like to say is we have the most educated workforce in the world and people that speak English the making eleven to Fifteen dollars an hour [noise]\nOkay ... thanks for the call a Mary Kay thinks that we're ... workforce there should be making more money\nUm you know I think that say I I kind of you know if you notice back to Nineteen Seventy nine when\nThe general level of education in the economy was lower the wage at that point if you adjusted for inflation is really just\nAbout a dollar an hour lower than now so I think people do feel like the reward the education having on up and up and that um prosperity has it been shared though I Know sometimes that that's one way of a kind of thinking about it\nOh Terry from Sheboygan joins us next to Terry good morning thanks for being on the morning show\nSays morning thank you and I agree with her comment that prosperity has not been share that's really the focus of my comment is that corporations have record profits um higher up in corporations flake\nThe salary of an employee I'm not saying they're not worth four foot twenty times\nUm is that it's incredibly number one discouraging and you only make that money because those workers work and if they don't work like she said before if you don't have quality people courteous people at the counters handing out of the stuff the sliver ing\nPeople are going to keep coming because they're gonna say oh I could go somewhere else to\nBe treated crappy and that's the sad thing they're being treated very very poorly ... I mean that's how they feel when they're when you're paid such a minimum amount of money we have to make a living [laughter]\nJerry ... thanks for the call or Laura what about you we uh uh in a it's an investment in employees or to uh to pay them a living wage but uh some companies don't seem to see it that way\n[noise] [noise] yeah um I think that it didn't matter I mean this is good news from Amazon in thinking about how do we share a prosperity um they they\n\nAnd we seem to most Laura gentler are you back there you go oh can you hear me yeah I can hear you now All right okay All right I'm so sorry that's okay\nSo ... of which are let's move on so the if was let's say Wisconsin raised its minimum wage from seven twenty five an hour where it is now to Fifteen dollars an hour\nHow would that affect the state's economy I mean you have some people saying well we you know we would lose employment there'd be people who get laid off if we do this so what do you think from your perspective what would happen to the state's economy if we raise the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour in Wisconsin\n[noise] well I think that the the right way to think about this is not like are we going to raise the minimum wage to pick up and get more than doubled the minimum wage in a day right every single day and I'm a structure that is moving towards Fifteen dollars an hour\nIs phasing in a series of increases\nUm so I don't think I'm I ... I wouldn't want to see an instant wave a wand wand waves and an instant\nIncrease to Fifteen dollars an hour that said um I think\nThat it's it's ah that\nThat that it's possible to move this wage um but it would impact a lot of people are the structure of work and the the um [noise] and the price structure for different employers in different ways and there would be a lot of adjustment that would have to go on a crop period right now though in Wisconsin um\nThere are fewer and fewer employers paying exactly seven twenty five an hour that's because the labor market is so tight so seven twenty five isn't um\nAs important at the floor as it was seven years ago right because the more and more work more and more employers are paying ten and eleven dollars an hour that floor is moving up a little bit ... a kind of increasing the minimum wage would just\nRequire everyone to meet that standard and move it in a predictable way I'm over time to Fifteen dollars an hour in a way that that uh employers could adjust and workers could could really been\nLet's take another call Tara is with us from Milwaukee show cure thanks for joining us on the morning show see\nI think you know I'm not going to be safe I was just mentioned that you know I make like twenty dollars an hour and and I I can make ends meet but it's not like I'm rolling in money and my sister you know she's a single mother didn't get to go up to children she didn't\nFather she's working at a nursing home making like twelve I think or something like that but um it she was just kind of the other day about it because she she has to live with my dad's you can't even make ends meet so I think he just encourages people to not even working it on state aid\n[laughter] All right ... thanks so that we got about a minute left of what does the minimum wage by these days [noise] well\nAt seven twenty five an hour I think it's very hard especially as you point that if you got kids if you're carrying rent buy or sell\n'em seven twenty five an hour and it's almost impossible and so people will stop a lot ah actually that the high cost of rent and the high cost of childcare are two things that\nThat or for families at\nThat wage or or just really hard to say\nWell even even twelve dollars an hour or does that bother you a rental in Wisconsin\nI'm In you know obviously it depends on that that town and quality on that and how many child care how much childcare costs on their side um but it's a stretch I think in\nAny way in a day and age with two kids to be able to afford rent it at the end play on twelve dollars an hour\nI'm Talking with Laura dresser is who is the associate director of cows in a professor in the school of social work at U. W. Madison we're talking about the minimum wage and what's the appropriate level what do you think about this if you get paid minimum wage in Wisconsin what's that like for you\nOr even if let's say you you get paid ten twelve dollars an hour is that enough\nTo be able to put food on the table and pay the rent or buy prescription drugs if you have to take some pay your insurance and things like that\nCan you get by what do you think is the appropriate for\nFor wages in ah in where you live what should it be what would you like to see it the or do you think people it's just the market and you get paid what you get paid and that's that either way let us know eight hundred six four to one two three four\nEight hundred six four to one two three four ideas that W. P. R. dot org or you can tweet us at WNPR mornings this is the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\n\nOf that seems counterintuitive if we do have a tight labor market why aren't we just going up as employers have to compete for skilled labor [noise]\nYeah there's a lot of um economists who spend a lot of time thinking about this question to answer that the most compelling to me are about the way that we have allowed our institutions to become a week but I'm the institutions\nThat help give workers voices help tie workers a prospects\nInto economic growth in general and I think principally of two things I think that the minimum wage which has been seven twenty five an hour as you said and two thousand I'm I don't know what that oh no more than ten years yeah oh not sorry almost ten years right and um and I you know\nFor those of you worked for the minimum wage in the Nineteen eighties it was three thirty five all across the Nineteen eighties I'm so that we let the minimum wage the comment relevant across\nThe decade I as a\nRaise it up um we've seen a shift in standards in low wage jobs in terms of the ability of workers to get hours out of them\n[noise] um and and we don't we have very weak regulation around those and those other standards of quality in low wage jobs especially how our can be counted on and how\nUm and and specific benefits like paid leave and um [noise]\nAnd I'm sick leave and then the third thing is unions um\nUh unions were\nMuch more important force in this economy that they were going to ... they were a force that rot workers' wages in manufacturing for level\nSystematically um and we've seen the decline of the nation and outright attack on unions and all of that undermined the ability of workers really\nTo make changes in the wage structure check to make demands of their company that they're contributing to and those companies are growing so that's where I look for the answers on why America kind of stands out or having\nGreater increase in inequality across these last year\nIn twenty four team the congressional budget office estimates that raising the minimum wage to ten dollars an hour over three years would result in job losses is this an unavoidable consequence of raising the minimum wage\n[noise] um you know there's some some economic theory kind of\nInforms that you do a lot of research has tended to find it very minimal impact\nUh on\nOn jobs I remember ah the first time this came up as\nEarly nineties there was research on the New Jersey Pennsylvania border once I had a minimum wage increase\nUh impact on total employment in the state that has a higher minimum wage and they really marvel\nThat eh they employment effect with so minimal I think another thing you can see that the states that have rising minimum wages are the states that have better economies I'm not saying that the minimum wage\nHigher minimum wage is making their economies better but it's also not the case that a higher minimum wage is ripping apart their economies are tearing apart and like that so there is always a balance for about\nA blast but it's also important\nTheir life you know what what is it and we're at the fact that the labor market and I'm an established it\nAngered at ... or so workers and employers around\nLet's take another call this time we'll go to Milwaukee where Dru is joining us uh drew thanks for being here in the morning show\nFor having me that's what led to real quick comments\nFirst I think everyone needs to think about the fact that there's really a supply and demand with jobs I mean if you can do something that less people can do your height and get paid more for it\nI also think we should differentiate between the minimum wage a living wage I think the minimum wage is more men for for students\nAnd people who are trying to gain skills are and that they can use the minimum wage to gain skills that they can make a living wage and the future that people who who stay at that level um need to think about should they expect to get paid more if its job decided not to be a living wage ...\nDrew thanks for the caller\nI'm right now we have a lot of people think about that question for me I'm let's take they can't work are you working at nursing home and indeed if there is an hour\nJob I think\nI think Laura I think I think we're going to I think we're going to need to ... and like that yeah well\nLet's let's try and and reconnect here I owe invite our callers to join us while you're doing that\nLaura dresser is the associate director of cows and a professor in the school of social work you do with the amount assume we're talking about um our uh what what people get paid and how much what's the right amount what's the you know minimum wage living wage these are all terms we throw around\nUm what do you think where you are or what would be for example wherever you're living what would be a minimum\nThat ah that you could

show\nMorning as well thank you very much for having me\nOf the uh this is the only institution in this day dedicated to the business of preserving Wisconsin's African American history and and your its founder and director of it to talk about how you got this started\nUm I I was previously in another lifetime or a journalist with there'll be teams each other vision I in fact I worked at a job for thirty nine years on the part of that time\nI decided to or ... or create a Historical Society\nI went back to school ... am to get my undergrad and filmmaking as as as what I vision requirement for my job to be better and I fell in love with history I'm learning that my\nFamily are always promoted it so it was just natural progression for me to to fall into that lane\nI'm when I graduated in ... when I retired\nI just assumed the responsibility of running a Historical Society\nA city gave me a building with nothing in it and I just kept it went through the process of collecting effect and we'd carriers creating exhibit a and highlighting a story that I had learned about while in school or\nAnd during the film called black communities a team they published it I received a grant from the national endowment for the arts to uh to do the film which is quite unusual for a college student uh and it just simply\nAll of that free stuff is accumulating more and more and um so now they're paying me to help them organize things that they didn't even pay for so it's become increasingly a bigger problem I see\nAnd well I mean we we accumulate a lot of clutter anyway because we just buy a lot of stuff and so if we if we are getting all this free stuff too that just kind of piles more and more on a ... ah you're seeing a lot of those ah what do people say when you tell him gee whiz you really need to get rid of this stuff [noise]\nThey're always saying look I didn't want this I don't know what to do with it but I just feel badly throwing it away and so now they're trying to figure out oh\nI Want to do something responsible with this I don't want to just throw it away but they've already got you know sixteen water bottles and reusable bags and enough T shirts you know for\nA twelve people and let alone for and so you know they just have a really hard time hurting with it and um but they don't need it they realize they don't want it\nAnd so now we try I just try to help them find a way I'm In a good place for somebody else to use it or to recycle them when\nYeah I I I tend to notice that most of my free stuff ends up in the trunk of my car because I mostly get it at golf tournaments and about once a year I just throw it all away and I think what I've started doing is just dumping it in the dumpster on the way out of the golf course\nBut we just it's everywhere I mean you you can't really go anywhere without somebody saying here have a pen have this have that um\nDoing All right well so what I was I'm trying to think about um in my column was to just start a conversation like this one about you know holistically thinking about all of this free stuff that's available and whether or not\nUm you know ... ... at the supply level whether or not this is all making sense when we're all trying to be more\nResponsible consumers and be more environmentally responsible and so I was just trying to think like OK we get these things from camp so we get these things from sports events we get these things for special events we get them from nonprofits and charities who want our donations or getting them everywhere and and is it okay for us to just say no\nWell it definitely is but we often don't and um and so like you said all of this stuff either ends up in the landfill\n'em or you know a lot of us are donating them to charities um\nBoth at home and abroad and you know there is no doubt that there is a need for these things I'm a little bit in the United states and also in places like Latin America and and in Africa and places um where some of these thrift stores and other places will donate things\nBut even they are now realizing that there's too much of this stuff and they don't even want it so we're kind of flooding the market and\nUm you know so I just wanted to start a conversation about whether or not at the production level you know do we really need these things for marketing and could companies and nonprofits and other organizations sort of rethink the freebie\nSo why do we take up I mean is it just like we we feel guilty if we don't someone offers you something and it's not polite to say you know I really don't want to know why do we do\nI mean I think that we think there'll be useful and I think that sometimes we feel guilty or sometimes we think oh well of course you know\nUm [noise] this is great I have a new kind of have a new shirt I didn't have to pay for it but the problem is is of course we get home and realize we have enough shirt so we have enough tens and we don't need these things but right it seems like a good deal\nAnd you know somebody's offering this stuff and it seems are rude to maybe decline it and um\nAnd sometimes we don't even have a choice it's just coming into our house so I've seen with my kids and my clients' homes you know their kids come home from camps in front of sporting events and they've got new tote bags and new lunch bags and hats and T shirts and all of these things so sometimes we're not even given the choice\nUm but yeah I mean I think there's a certain amount of guilt or you're feeling badly about turning it down and also we think like oh well certainly we can make use of this but then of course we don't\nAnd then there are all of those around a mailing labels that you get from various a nonprofit groups I think that we probably have an entire ... at our house we have to send\nYou know hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pieces of mail over the next ten years just to use it but we have no right\nAnd guess what people are spending less mail right so um this is a really big um source of free stuff or you know coming into our home and it's something I wasn't able to touch on it in my article um just because of space but that a lot of readers then followed up with me and said why do I keep getting all of these address labels\nWhy they send me these tote bags why do they some of these T shirts that don't fit why are they sending me pad the paper I don't need\nI Would rather have them use 'em you know my money and my donations for things for their cars and not to um you know sending me you know greeting cards and all of those things and you're right in this era of us all doing more things\nUm electronically we don't need those address labels and um you know\nEvery day in my household I get a mailing that includes one of those\nSo I Try and get them on my email but then I couldn't get him off\nThe show [laughter] exactly exactly\nOkay so ah the um ... it but it isn't just companies and so for you you you often even see I understand uh boxes of free stuff or garage or yard sales\nOh definitely definitely I mean well those can be [laughter] those are dangerous for other reasons um garage sales and things like that I'm for people to collect things that you know our\nUm seemingly treasures while in when they're there and they just can't resist and they bring home and then find that they don't really want 'em but that's a whole another story but but yeah I mean I just um I guess I just wanted to start a conversation about you know things like okay we um\n[noise] you know water bottles we all have these reusable water bottles now and we think oh this is so great for the environment we're not using the single use plastic water bottles but then\nAnd we seem to be creating another problem in that these plastic reusable water bottles are almost like a disposable item because there there are so many of them and the same goes for reusable shopping bags you know like you go to the store there Ninety nine cents okay I'll buy another one\nI can throw away my other one you know I can they're sort of they become almost\nA new problem and that they um they have a sort of increased the bulls water bottles reusable water bags and things like that are reusable shopping bag um and that now we've created new problem in that these things are disposable now and um\nAnd so it's just worry that and I mean yes we can we use them yes there are ways to um used plastic water bottles and reduce shopping bags and a lot of other ways but still we seem to be sort of flooding the market um with these things in creating a whole nother problem because they're either free or ... or inexpensive\nAnd half the time to get to the store and realize your bag home anyway\nRight and then when you do you buy another one yet another one that's right and then\nPeople are like oh I have all these reusable shopping bags and I don't know how to store them and I never use them and I always forget that so um I just thought you know we there was this recent effort um you know that everybody's heard of about trying to reduce the use of um or eliminate all together\nOn single use plastic straws you know and not just got me to thinking like that caught on and had such momentum but like what about all these other things that are sort of now considered disposable and and that we're not otherwise um thought of as disposable in the past\nWell it ... you know we just it seems to me what you're asking is to do is to just be a lot more mindful about what we bring into the house and the first place and and uh and then you know do we need it well don't take it then and\nI really think about whether you needed or or whether you don't um I think what we what we should do is\nUh have a discussion about what to do okay so this stuff all came into her house now you know would we do with it how do we do clutter our house we were going to get to that on the other side of our news break\nAnd as we continue our discussion I'm and I'm Wondering what our listeners take do you find yourself being buried under a mountain of free stuff do you always take it when it's offered let us know what you think about that at eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four what do you do with all the stuff eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas WPRI dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings uh Nicole ... is a freelance writer for the Washington Post an owner of a neat Nick of Washington DC based professional organizing\nConstant no good for that to a recent piece for the Washington Post is I declared ... for a living and I hate free stuff we're talking about free stuff and what we should do with it wondering what you think eight hundred six four to one two three four it's a morning show on the ideas network [noise]\nUm yeah I mean I think people um you know we sort of try to think together and often actually our kids can help us come up with great ideas but um you know I think that there is sort of um an exhaustion level right that all of a sudden hits us all because it's like oh we have so much stuff we're constantly going through it we're\nConstantly trying to downsize we're constantly trying to um you know move things in and out of our house in a way\nI'm that's not only responsible but also helpful to the way we live so people just feel like a little bit exhausted by it all and so I always just try to think with them um you know about about what we can do um [noise] that will both um\nYou know both help them and getting rid of what they need but also potentially help somebody else so [noise] um there's a lot of people who want this stuff to go to sort of its highest purpose and I think that that's um [noise]\nUh you know really admirable you know and so we do try to think creatively 'em but sometimes you know I mean right as creatively as we think and even if we're you know we're donating these things some places may not want whatever it is they may not want 'em a portfolio\nEmbossed with the company's name they may not want a magnet or a key chain or whatever\nI'm not the thing to do is maybe they just take it to a local dump 'em so that they can dispose of it properly whether it's metal or an electronic something or you know something like that so not just maybe tossing it in your trash can but like taking it somewhere where they can dispose of it in a more environmentally friendly way\nYou can also worth noting that for some people may be struggling just reach those might be something they rely on I mean we're not trying to humanize anyone you\nKnow not at all and as I said earlier there is definitely a need 'em and I don't want to minimize that at all um I I mean one of my sort of um things that I work with clients on is um you know only donating things and giving things to charities and to um nonprofits that\nThey that people will really benefit from and use and there's no doubt that there is a need in both the United states and an eight countries um elsewhere in the world so I don't want to minimize that it's just that\nEven those organizations are feeling sort of overrun by the stuff you know and um and even though we all want to donate you know things that are\nUm nice and clean and wearable and useful um you know the fact is is some of the things just um aren't useful or desired by the people who need them and so\nThere's just sort of um [noise] they're the you know we're just producing so much stuff at this point that um [noise] you know it's just hard to get to give away and um you know but but definitely you know I I think as much as we can you know donate to places\nUm who needed and who will distribute it to those that need\nSo I'm curious Nicole how you got into the business of helping people organize their space that something I I Would really like to know\n[noise] yeah so I started my business about twelve years ago um I um I sort of have always been a very organized person and I I had been working I'm In politics\nAnd in Washington DC especially where there's a lot of people who work long days and I'm doing sort of have time to do some of the things that need to be done around their house they may be\nDual income families with where you know the mom and dad are both working and they have young children and they're working full time and they sort of are barely you know maintain um their regular sort of\nA lives and so I just I realized that there was maybe I'm a a\nA a place where it could be helpful to people to help them organize their homes um things that they just\nMaybe could do if they had enough time or maybe just aren't adept at doing 'em and so I just started you know talking to people and I've done everything from organizing\nKitchens to play rooms to closets to helping people move 'em I just think in this\nYou know fast paced a world we're all living in you know some of these other things can sort of be pushed aside um but that if you're home is organized um it can be um you know a major life easier I'm On an everyday basis and\nUm you know can help everybody just feel um like the house is running more efficiently and um and more\nUm [noise] yeah and it's just more organized so I just sort of you know I started and I think\nIn the past couple of years um I mean really for the entire time but\nUm people are really starting to rethink you know why is coming into their homes what they need how they can be ...\nIt'll last um and sort of just reevaluating I'm there that the purchases they make and also all of this free stuff that just ends up\nIn their ... and a much not even get started on all the things we're inheriting from our parents these days\nSo whether or not get married at age really I'm right on the show so that the whole nother thing\nRight I mean a lot of this stuff that our parents thought and that was so valuable at the time or things that people um of a younger generation aren't as interested in having and I'm you know are hard to sort of figure out what to do with as well yes I help people with that um a lot\nOf doubt it could be a reality show what's this painting doing in my house right\nOr the beautiful old you know secretary Des ... that is lovely and I really um you know I I think it's so beautiful but I just you know my my laptop doesn't really fit\nInto the ... who's less organized people from Wisconsin or people from DC\nOh my gosh you know I can only and on that I mean honestly I think that\nYou know there are just starting to people everywhere and there are organized people everywhere but um but you know you really have to sort of take the time to think about some of this stuff and more and more families are just so I'm busy and living such hectic lies that some of these things can fall by the wayside so that's when they called me\nTo sort of how well we we have a hectic our here on the other morning show we'll continue our discussion with Nicole
