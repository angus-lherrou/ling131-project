P. H. imbalance or something like that so the the soil sample leave sample is going to be very important to make sure you have proper nutrients going into that tree\nWhat is the uh uh what's the most popular variety of apple grown in a in Wisconsin [noise]\nWell I wouldn't say a hunting Crispin pizzazz apple\nAnd those are some some recent ah some varieties that have been added recently or that but I mean especially the hunting Chris that one is kind of the hot new\nApple of course it's been in development for years but uh that's those are fairly recent are there are there some traditional apple varieties that we grow in Wisconsin that you don't find a lot elsewhere [noise]\nUm no they're sent me the traditional max the Cortland Macintosh Carlin a regents\nUm there are some um in all depending on where you are a McKown colon they call it um you know a lot of that is found in Wisconsin and mainly just in Wisconsin\nUh-huh and and are there um ah are there are some varieties of apple that grow well in one part of the state but maybe not in in some other part of the state [noise]\nYou know at the advancements in agriculture I Would say no not really um for the most part a lot of people are going into the high density planting if you're getting into major production\nUm it's irrigated a you typically have bras fans or some sort of a protection from Mother Nature and the price\nSo a lot of these newer trees a lot of these ... varieties that um yes can be temperamental grow you know they need more calcium or something and then some of the older varieties but a pretty much can grow on just about anywhere you may need to put some soil ...\nConstant has all these Apple's so where do they all go do we produce more than we eat within the state\nWe do and it's from my understanding we only produce about a third of what Wisconsin consumes\nAnd and so uh where do all of a all the apples that we grow in Wisconsin that we don't eat here where do they end up where do they go\nWell various places um of Minnesota there's west got a that a tax out apples and they shift to your own nationwide\nOkay um and ah what we had a we had a comment or a from somebody who said one I'm a ... they're\nThey have a kindergartner at home and she came home with the cutting and coloring project that showed growing apple trees from apple seeds but that's really not how it works at an orchard is it\nWell not so much but there are a lot of people a cell phone by a lacrosse area uh he he had as thousands of trees that he started from seat a\nMajority of the trees now are grafted correct you you get a a hearty wrote stock and cut it at an angle you take a piece of ... on water last year as growth and you're cut that at an angle and then basically tape the two together and to form a new tree\nThe hardy rug stock is going to last the harsh winters in the ... in our area to say a Honeycrisp apple mhm but\nMost most apple trees are known grafted like that there are still people that are planting seeds and trying to develop new apples are different apples\n... interesting so are there some new markets that are Wisconsin's apple growers are ... are are looking at [noise]\nWell we definitely are are trying to you know get into the by local and and trying to encourage people to buy local farmers markets different say don't go out your local apple orchard tried

that and at the same time so\nIt kind of coverage to things the festival and the enjoy the outdoors scenery\nWhich so what's the apple crop up in like a this year up on the ... peninsula\nUm there's a there's a nice decent crop it's not a huge crop of Apple's this year we had a huge crop last year so it's pretty common to have a little bit smaller crop next year but um we we have plenty of of apples for everybody for Apple fast that's for sure\nAnd what uh what's the most popular variety that to you that you're putting on the market this year\nWhile it used to be Cortland used to be the most popular but I think Honeycrisp is taken over the popularity part a little bit we do have our own apple that we sell owned variety is called ... or low but that's\nThat's the only available here in Bay field but uh it's it's a nice combination of of a sweet tart apple but\nMhm so again what advice do you have for people who are going to be making the trip to the field for the festival\nHong

I'm Wondering if apple growers always have the high there the colony or do they count on that these that are around ...\nIt depends on where you're at here we have a lot of wild bees yet we have a lot of natural habitat or when you get in some areas where the orchards are bigger blocks and it's all it is apple trees they bring in a lot of their own their own bees or the\nSo far we have a lot of a wild land a lot of flowers and different things for bee habitat so so far we've just relied on on natural natural pollination I guess you'd say\nGeorge ... thank you for that question eight hundred six four to one two three four the number to call if you'd like to\nAsk a question about Apple's who are the main field apple festival or tell us about your favorite folk festival it's all fair game

area\nSo it it's very important as I told other people I mean apple fast is\nWhenever you can bring your your customers to you rather than having to take your your product and send it out somewhere it it it makes a big difference I mean it's not and it's not just apple growers that\nAh anybody connected to the apple festival whether it's lodging from you know fifty miles away are full for the

bay films also known as a as an area where they grow a lot of berries and there's even some commercial flowers a grown there is so what is it about the ... peninsula that makes it such a great place to well and and so\nWhile it it's a lot of it is the influence of the the big body of water that we have out there it's kind of it ... at a delays our spring a little bit and uh our our weather in the spring has delayed a little bit because of the lake\nAnd the fall it's it delays it delays when we get our first heart foster killing frost that extend the season a little bit longer in the fall\nAnd the other is our our soil type here we're we're blessed with some of the glacier\n... they call the than Iraqi soil because typically the native or the regular land around here is all clay which isn't as conducive to growing\nTrees and fruits and married so we have a a pretty good soil type to grow that grow a lot of different crops and the the um the micro climate of the late makes a big difference\nAnd do the gym where where do you what do you do with all your apples do they get shipped out of state I mean you can't eat all those write in Mayfield rank\nAll week for Apple fat well we

teens some people wanted to know why didn't she reported right away Kelly or how do you make sense of that\nAre a number of reasons why survivors tend to either not report at all or way a very long time so let's just start with some numbers for the best time or is that we have\nUm that one in five women roughly and why and Thirteen men will be sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime and the numbers for actually probably hire 'em because there is such a greater stigma of mental reports on sexual assault\nOn but less than ten percent ... ever report their assault either to their school or to the police that they're on a college campus on those who do on average they weigh about eleven months to report a so again it's far more likely that the victims will never come forward

me I was never\nAny great the person's assault and he was given a choice of ... um\nAnd most people in the community and believe me so I I Can't imagine in Nineteen eighty two I'm attending an

say\nThis happened to me I'm I'm very open in public about my own sexual assault and some people who are either friends of mine um you know that I Am a safe place to to discuss that with but I think a

of mine that I went to college with\nJust sent me a message and they said this is a man who assaulted me he's a semi public figure I just want someone to know that I told someone England she ... she doesn't want to report doesn't want to go to the police but again she wanted someone to bear witness and the fact that this happened that this man did this to her back in college right and that she doesn't doesn't ever want to come forward but\nIn the ... percent chance that maybe he become the Supreme Court justice one day that maybe there's a record or some some sort of a witness to to that happening to her um because I think that obviously is what it took for Dr Ford to come forward she did not want to come forward she was terrified\nI'm this was not again thinking about up ending her life and getting death threats that is not something that anyone would openly want in their life right and so I'm there for her to come forward at all um you know I I I tend to want to believe what happened because it just makes so so little Spencer animal but would come forward after all these years if it if it weren't true\nUm and so I mean it'll it'll have almost have to be a masochist to want to come forward um if it weren't true um and and and have that happen to your life\nOh we've seen cases especially over the past year where people have come forward above the soldiers who happened decades ago how does that affect the severe it it'd be a huge issue in people's minds how people react to the\nThink it depends on how many people you know who have been assaulted I mean I think\nStatistically it's impossible that you don't know someone who has been sexually assaulted we look at the one in three and one and one in Thirteen that's that's a really high number of people and so I Would say that for if you don't know someone who had been sexually assaulted and maybe because they don't feel like you are the person to talk to\n'em and so I think what tends to happen and and what tends to sort of feed into a lot of these sort of rape mess um is is this idea that you know um when we have a long history of of viewing women as deceptive in general right we we have um you know go back to Adam and Eve\nWe assume that women tend to not be truth tellers and so when they come forward um we automatically assume the worst of the victim and assume the best of the person who's being accused and so I think we need to sort of flip that on its head and sort of think about why is that we are so unlikely to believe the survivors of sexual assault what is it about our society\nGoing forward is automatically lying why we dismiss that that so quickly\nLet's take another call this time we'll go to La Crosse where mark is on the line mark good morning thanks for joining us\nThey're good morning you know several years ago as a physician those goals to Google ... inappropriate sexual conduct a woman to want to it was ... was that there was a terrific time during my life\nActually occurred grooming a beautiful here and you know so little almost certain to police rumbled has us there's a wider choice which go switch more where should not to to do with all of a sudden boom of the willing to be under the apologized and the story I think it's like um it was work we would term\nBrutal ruthless duo believe claims like this without evidence we were told to believe in ...\nMy wife was gruesome says no we don't need to believe when you can read books when I was just so you just know the woman come forward Dr Ford used to be believed because\nImagine somebody cooperation equally because somebody finds we're building stories just assume recently the things I'm listening to all humans movies from America\nFrom academics or college campuses unless you're in the real world road too much at all in less than what I'm ... years to be honest with you it's it's not very reason smoker intellectual smokers appropriate to process is everybody nuts for sports individuals\nOr mark we think you want to give you a chance to respond\nYeah and and again on we've heard a lot of this conversation right that that we should be really concerned with with with what the false reports and I just I Want to go back to science I Want to go back to evidence right if we look at um how often false reporting happened there to to ... to eight percent chance of police reports of rape that are unfounded in some way\nWe treat it in our culture as if there is a fifty fifty percent chance that she could be lying on so absolutely we should be circumspect and putting Sears accusations in the world with without fact checking I mean we need to do that\nUm this is why Dr Fort asked for an FBI investigation I think she wanted this process you wanted to make sure that that due diligence happen um and so again um we need to be aware of that absolutely\nUm but the unfortunate consequence of assuming that this happens all the time is that it makes people think that there are a lot more false accusations and there actually are in that women just live off of the hat\nSo when celebrities accused of rape the immediate thought\nIs that a woman is looking for a quick payday um that she wants a settlement and any short maybe this happens once in a while but it's kind of absurd to think that this is a good and like get rich quick schemes to have sex with a celebrity and then we go to the next morning and say\nThat it was a salt and and and wanting to be to go through that um and so again it's just not something that most people do overwhelmingly\nIf you're worried about false accusations you are far more likely to be sexually assaulted\nThan to be falsely accused the numbers just don't support that we tend to think that false accusations happen a lot more often they do because they are highly publicized\nUm there's a lot more media attention when there is a false accusation and when that is at its prosecuted and so just understanding how often this happens I'm\nAgain one of survivor comes forward it really doesn't tend to be a he said she said according to science there is a Ninety percent chance that she's telling the truth is the second allegation of surface rape services\nOn the science tells us the likelihood is Ninety eight percent on the rare cases or false report kind of fit into two categories so tainted they're lying to get into trouble or people with mental health issues that are afforded as neither of those cases so do a false reports happen yet but they're so\nRare and I know that doesn't come for anyone who had gone through that and I'm Sorry that he went through this that that's a horrible thing to have happened to you and please no I hear that and I'm not advocating that we had\nNo process um I think one thing that has been\nWhen we say believe women and belief survivors that is not saying that we should automatically convict a matter of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt no one is saying that stand a better than I have a criminal trial involving presentation of evidence on both sides\nIn this case it just means taking that victims seriously I'm believing women is just not\nReflect the we sort of thing that we are I'm thinking about here on the idea that we understand how shockingly normal it is for women to be sexually assaulted um that maybe we should take her seriously and and do and Arthur out due process with is\nUm but I think we need to be better about having a more thoughtful conversation about who we are asking to believe I'm In this process right and so yes to false reports happen absolutely but you are more likely to be struck by lightning to be then falsely accused I mean even the two to eight percent a false reports\nThere are more people currently I'm saying that their cars or so and then then coming and coming forward with false accusations and so just looking at the number is here and there are far more people who are being sexually assaulted and never reporting than there are things falsely accused\nMark thanks for your call 'em I Want to take a quick call and then we'll get to kill the wheels response in ... after the news of Chris is calling us from a small town and Wisconsin cruise tell us your story quickly please\nYeah I'm I have a friend actually followed by our fault and she never told anyone that her life in front of all it violates how an app called her\n... her and going to file charges against them he ended up committing suicide and writing a letter saying that control itself anyway but the sad thing is that he did it any other girls and now she's going through hell\nShe didn't how he feels like he ruined all these people's lives\nWe didn't come forward and can fall\nCruise thank you for sharing the story and Kelly wills when we continue our discussion ... maybe a talk a little bit about what Christ said to say in how a sexual assault has an effect beyond of first hand or abuse\nWe're talking about the subject of sexual assault and uh how it's reported or not reported we want to know what you've seen what you've experienced at eight hundred six four to one two three four\nEight hundred six four to one two three four our discussion we'll continue this is the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio I'm John Monson [noise]\nAnd so we have there are large numbers of men who never coming forward um because of the shame associated with being sexually assaulted we see there's a lot um again I had a a male student of mine come to me and talk to me and I was the first person that he had reported to ever um because we had been talking about their culture and class\nUm and he realized that what had happened to him was silly a sexual assault but again the idea that I was the first person that he could confide in and I'm I'm headed I could be there for him but again there are so much stigma when we talk about male survivors absolutely men can be sexually assaulted and are sexually assaulted\nAnd we need to take that seriously and and make it um make our culture a safer one where men feel comfortable reporting that\nUm and so I'm I'm very happy that he brought this subject up and I'm I'm ... I'm so sorry that happened to you um that is awful\nWe talked about why people don't always report sexual assault perhaps the bigger question here is why ... happening in the first place you why is that I mean why do we do it why why does this happen\nI think we need to start younger um in terms of talking about healthy intimacy I'm One of my good friends that I'm really worried for my son right now I I'm I'm where he's going to be falsely accused\nUm and I sort of disaster you know what kinds of conversations are you having with him about sex education about concerned are you talking to him about you know what what consent looks like um you know are you saying that are you telling are reminding him that if he's too drunk or a two to drive a cart is probably too drunk to give consent\nUm and so I think the more honest conversations we're having with our children um the better it is will be\nA and and oftentimes it's not going to happen in schools I'm right in terms of um comprehensive sexual education but if we if we can start at home and and have an open and honest conversations with our children about this and and tell them I'm\nAgain what boundaries look like maybe and not forcing them to give a hub to someone they don't want to give a hug to re um and and having earlier conversations around consent um so I have an amazing yoga instructor and she has little consent cards even on the yoga mats and to see are you comfortable with me touching your body during yoga\nAnd some people are and some people are not comfortable right to have to be able to flip back hard over and say yes or no so she can help adjust to you if you're doing something incorrectly\nThat's really great right I mean there are ways in which we can talk about consent and and and better and more applied ways um\nThat they were really intervene and get to the root cause of this right if we look back on even in the Bronx Turner case right this is a a swimmer who\nUm had raped and unconscious woman behind a dumpster um there were two men from Sweden who intervened because they they recognize that what was happening was a sexual assault one of the reasons for that is that sweet and those are really great job of talking about comprehensive sex education from a very early age and stuff\nBetter language to talk about this than we do in the United states\nGenerally wills to just communication at the university Wisconsin Steven's point she's with this we're talking about sexual assault this hour on the morning show we sometimes ... the world around is through comedy\nHere's a moment from an episode of Saturday Night live several people are having a nice time of dinner until someone brings open up that accuses comedian ... I'm Sorry of sexual misconduct\nPeople at the table ... reluctantly agreed to talk about it and here's what happens\nTo this I'll go first\n[laughter] sure you want to do yes I see on the topic of the only time\nWill will\nThat\nSlowly\nUm some lives with me\nMe\nMe this was supposed to make people laugh ... uncomfortable we are talking about ... what did what did you think about the sketch\nAbsolutely so this is one of my favorites um envy the highlights how hard is have these conversations right and because we tend to not\nHave open and honest conversation about sexual assault period we just don't have the language to talk about it at All right and so um the more we can understand that and learn about these issues\nAnd the more we can be open and honest about these conversations about how often sexual assault happens how to prevent it um bystander intervention are\nThe better we are able to have those conversations and one of the difficulties here ... anytime I'm someone who is accused belongs to a member of your political party we're just in general less likely to be objective right it's\nAnd ... what I'm noticing even and this past week that\nUm I I some of the men who were defending Al Franken and when he was accused ... sexual misconduct\nI'm aware now openly invested and critiquing rape culture right because this fits within their political narrative\nUm and so I don't I don't want us to only care about sexual assault and survivors when it's politically convenient I Want us to take care ... is\nUm and there's this fascinating ... study the highlights how voters could recognize that a politician has line but consider them authentic and appealing ... even if they are lying to that fits their their world view right\nI I think we tend to when someone from our own party look past any sort of misconduct or allegations because it's ... it's just too important right without us what Bill Clinton on the left ... too many coming to the fence because again I'm ... there's just so much at stake\nAnd so I Would have ... walk back if you're really defending someone or um uh you know think about again how much does ... political bias play into this in terms of how you are defending that person um\nOr or reinforcing their behavior um what'd you care as much of that person ... versus a political person than him for the position and so um\nI think in general um we tend to have not great conversation but they become even worse when it becomes really highly politicized\n...\nChristian ... before the woman ... demand but let's say amen was accusing a female Supreme Court nominee ... ... this conversation uh be it'd be different and we might have to continue this conversation about this question ... interesting moment but to give me the quick answer here you've got one\nOh gosh I mean the dynamics changed ... um we tend to have it in general on Cape manny's the term empathy to describe ... um when men are actually are accused ... sexual assault on because we tend to um hyper identify with the perpetrator over the victim\nUm honestly I mean this this little book very different because the dynamics have changed but I mean one one instance of this\nKnow professor was a case by her her ... um they feel again we had a sort of you know rethink the way then which they look at um how how power works um in full power I felt that sort of gets to your answer though that as well\nWe'll we'll continue this uh this conversation a in this line in in just a moment to this is the morning show you're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\n\nChecking the W.

election\nStay Walters is senior producer at Wisconsin I and the former Madison bureau chief for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel you recently wrote a piece for urban Milwaukee titled the rise of absentee ballots Steve welcome to the morning show\nJohn thanks very much thanks for having me on\nSo how do we know that more voters prefer to cast absentee ballots\nWell I find it very interesting you use different a different time period I'm going to look over Twenty years in Nineteen Ninety six and presidential election four point six percent of Wisconsin voters cast absentee early voting ballots\nIn the election of President Trump's twenty seven point too so that's the five fold increase over Twenty years now there are a few reasons for this a state laws have made it easier and now both parties have adopted vote early as really one of their major goals so it's it's an absolutely fascinating trend\nAnd professor Barry Burton other you W Madison political science who really

whether or not you have one tree or fifty thousand is you're You're welcome to join the apple growers association\nAnd that is truly just a group of people sharing their knowledge experience and the ideas on an out and grow apples\nAnd where can orchard growers go or if they're looking for more information about crop maintenance [noise] um\nYou know the idea of them has a very good uh agricultural um department and they do supply a lot of great information\nOn Apple's the trees themselves and maintenance or different ... different diseases so the ... system or you've got to be extensive system as a very good place to go\nSo let's talk about this year's Wisconsin apple crop how how's it looking this year [noise]\nWell I Would say overall is looking very good you know everybody depending on where you are in the state of add your difficulties southern Wisconsin or Madison area you guys out flooding yeah oh it's a lot of water are there in Wisconsin various parts were\nDeclared drought at one point and in the summertime so we had a difficult age but we've made it through again\nSo uh what as the weather is always a a major challenge for growing anything I mean uh it's um they say there are no atheists in Fox holes I don't know I think that might have\nSo besides whether what are some of the other challenges that apple growers face during the season [noise]\nWell obviously asked why there is probably probably the biggest part of it but you know\nApple trees are already you're around concern truly am in the wintertime you out whether or not they're going to get frost damage or er freeze damage that routes they're going to get them come springtime as they're they're starting to come out of their doormen the\nNutrients are a big factor you know and the nutrients are big factor throughout the girl and she's not play um you know fruit set pruning um a lot of the ... has done one of the trees are darn mentors should be more of\nA you know and then make sure you have a decent size crap load on there that you're not overbearing the trade ... up by any bearing system\nSo yeah I'm just several several different aspects of it\n[noise] we're talking about apples a wing guys does the president of the Wisconsin apple growers association and the owner of Bush will end up back apple orchards\nOut what are your favorite apples that you make sure to pick each fall let us know eight hundred six four to one two three four\nIdeas of WNPR dot org or\nA or tweet us at WNPR mornings so\nThe um what is it about Wisconsin that makes it such a great place to grow apples into something in the soil are the kind of water we have here or what the last glacier left behind what is it that makes our state a good place to grow apples [noise] I Would\nSay yes all of the above our our climate is very conducive ah falls we get the cooling temperatures which helped bring out the sweetness and the color of the apples\nOr soil as is typically going to be very rich or even some of the Sandy or soils are somewhat good [noise] um yeah I Would say is uh all the above\nI Know a geologist this summer I stopped ought to replace and had talked about the amount of loss deposits of soil that was in this general area which we have several orchards throughout this area\nThe um uh if if someone was interested in planting just planting some apple trees in their yard what advice would you give them [noise]\nWell um again I'd say two different varieties\nMaking sure that you can cross pollinate um [noise] watch the fertilizing of art I'm sure ... trees and I talked to several people that said that number could apple they never get apples if they're fertilizing that she's going to want to put it in the growth instead of and the apples\nSo soil nutrition is is a major part of it too much like growing anything\nAnd then making sure that you do not only soil samples but you do leave samples as well so you do an analysis on what nutrition as in the leaf that way you know okay I may have calcium in the soil but it's not getting to the tree\nYou know you may have an M. P. H. imbalance or something like that so the the soil sample leave sample is going to be very important to make sure you have proper nutrients going into that tree\nWhat is the uh uh what's the most popular variety of apple grown in a in Wisconsin [noise]\nWell I wouldn't say a hunting Crispin pizzazz apple\nAnd those are some some recent ah some varieties that have been added recently or that but I mean especially the Honeycrisp that one is kind of the hot new apple of course it's been in development for years but uh that's those are fairly recent are there are there is some traditional apple varieties that we grow in Wisconsin that you'd\n[noise] um\nNo they're semi the traditional max the Cortland Macintosh Carlin a regents um there are some um in all depending on where you are a ... they call it um you know a lot of that is owned in Wisconsin and mainly desks in Wisconsin\nUh-huh and and are there um ah are there are some varieties of apple that grow well in one part of the state but maybe not in in some other part of his day [noise] feeding\nAll at the advancements in agriculture I Would say no not really um for the most part a lot of people are going into the high density planting if you're getting into major production\nUm it's irrigated a you typically have bras fans or some sort of a protection from Mother Nature and the price so a lot of these newer trees louder the norm varieties that\nCan be temperamental grow you may need mark calcium or something and then some of the older varieties but a pretty much can grow on just about anywhere he may need to put some soil amendments that\nShow ... Wisconsin has all these Apple's so where do they all go we produce more than we eat within the state\nWe do and it's from my understanding we only produce about a third of what Wisconsin consumes\nIt is so where do all about all the apples that we grow in Wisconsin that we don't eat here where do they end up where do they go\nWell\nVarious places um of Minnesota there's a west got to that two packs out apples and they shipped to you know nationwide\nOkay um and uh well we had a we had a comment or a from somebody who said one I'm a ...\nThey're they have a kindergartner at home and she came home with a cutting and coloring project that showed growing apple trees from apple seeds but that's really not how it works at an orchard is it well\nNot so much but there are a lot of people a duck stuff all buying for a lacrosse area uh he he has thousands of trees that he started from seats a\nMajority of the trees now are grafted correct you you get a a hearty rug stock and you cut it at an angle you take a piece a sign on water last year as growth and you're cut that at an angle and then basically tape the two together and to form a new tree\nThe hearty rug stock is going to last the the harsh winters in the Sinai animal is going to carry the um say Honeycrisp apple\nMhm most most apple trees are known grafted like that there are still people that are planting seeds in trying to develop new apples are different apples\n... interesting so are there some new markets that Wisconsin's apple growers are ... are are looking at [noise]\nWell we definitely are are trying to you know get into the by local and trying to encourage people to buy local farmers markets different say don't go out your local apple orchard known to support the community that is as well as ...\nWell I uh I I did have a a a Honeycrisp apple this morning that was grown in Wisconsin I'm not going to say where ah and ah I'm about to have some homemade apple sauce that was made from a apples that my son in law grew\nIn uh in his yard so uh I'm I'm doing my part to shop local here I Wayne thanks so much for spending the time and sharing a your information about apples and the best of luck to you\nFruit

field for the annual ... festival you plan to hit that way there's weekend\nWhere you're going to your favorite orchard maybe in your part of Wisconsin it was called the eight hundred six four to one

we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we did it one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final ... which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nAnd David Greene is costing our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and then all of this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades\nThat there are barricades set up and there are more police year than I have seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they pass an essay but they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting just the basics the government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh out of their colleagues Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Scott ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this food we have Grassley I think I Am fine stand is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't quite there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that last remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I don't remember I remember that I have a very ugly remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the Kavanaugh fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling a under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be her\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nAssault even under the laws standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even worse than that Dr Florida then invites other witnesses to the event soon those witnesses either refuted or allegations\nOr fail to reach corroborate there for the reasons discuss the all I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this\nThe preponderance of evidence standard and the cold\nWe have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who are known judge Kevin on his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that we received\nAre more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leaves and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations in the FBI confirmed what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by a judge Kavanaugh and ... the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations\nThere also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever being good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate there is simply no reason then to the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us\nThe Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and ... the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork or playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become sort\nOf listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the form of vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being born to which is the way the conservatives refer to this Nina Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nI actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert barks nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how Bork ferrets and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interests did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to\nI think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being me um but\n... views it turned out he answered the questions quite forthrightly he didn't have very strong and he had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme view this\nCase Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately are not quite said what is the U.S\nBecause actually correct so bored for example said he's sticking to his you that the one person one vote decision was wrong\nKavanaugh or would not\nReally expresses use on almost anything he he would always say that's Supreme Court precedent um I I as a judge had to follow the Supreme Court precedent or things like that so\nThey're really they're not hurting let me stop you there because Charles Grassley who's finished his speech on now Dianne Feinstein be equivalent Democrat on the short term it has begun her remarks once was lost some of them", "show_name": "Morning Show", "year": "2018", "city":
