show on the ideas network I'm John months and in what appears\nTo be any election year not to farm state Republicans President Trump has ordered the environmental protection agency to all the all the year round sale of gasoline with higher blends of ethanol up to Fifteen Percent that's good news for corn growers and ethanol plants what does it mean for the rest of us\nWill talk about that with a reporter who's been following this story Eric both covers energy policy and politics for Politico his recent piece there is titled Trump's ethanol moved delivers gift to corn country Eric welcome to the morning\nShow good morning for morning first off or could you explain the current restrictions on ethanol sales and then tell us what would change under this order\n[noise] yeah I Am right now most gasoline is ten percent ethanol which is a biofuel mostly mad at a corner and in this country that's almost what when you go fill out the country are probably by each had and you may not even realize it or\nWhy corn growers and ethanol producers why'd you know like any businesses they want more market and they want to take advantage of the government program called their annual will fuel standard\nTime which requires a certain amount of effort and I'll get blended into gas but they want to but they want permission to put more and more fuel and a ... to go up to Fifteen per se but the clean Air Act\nMakes that hard there are restrictions you know during the summer it gets hot we have a lot of uh uh ozone alert days or smog alert days and the steel is thought that it may contribute to that problem so the clean Air Act to create these restrictions ETA\nPresident Trump through the EPA is saying let's change that rule this it sort of outdated as we think that and you know by allowing year round sells gasoline stations will be able to just have\nThe necessary it comes to sell it year round\nThey won't say what's the point if I have having these arms for only eight months of the year right half the year the main driving even that will be able to buy it so now the theory is if they can if you can get demand year round you can do it with all the palms car garage and happy ethanol producers at the AFI\nOn the morning show today\nCould more than happy to be here\nBecause we're focusing on accents today I wanted to make sure that we got this side of the way first what is the difference between an accent and a dialect\nOh that's a really good question uh an accident or refers basically to pronunciation whereas dialect involves words and Senate structures and things like that\nSo I'm I'm from the south and I will you may hear it to some extent or other uh have a southern accent but I also use different words I use different pronouns I say y'all instead of you for a plural\nHum and uh I have a different grammar or I can say things like you might should do that [noise] ah so those are ... accent is a much more focus term\n[noise] well I have to say that as your accent doesn't sound very southern to me but I'm a maybe after we talked for well a pick that up so what are the characteristics of the Wisconsin accent as we know it today\n[noise] well uh it's changing very rapidly and they're very new first of all so things are just in some ways starting to emerge\nUh a couple of things that you hear a lot in Wisconsin include a people having a distinctive pronunciation of that ad vow all of the vowing bad in bats and so forth specifically when it comes before a G\nSo people will talk about the stereotype of Wisconsin nights how Wisconsin I'd say bag [noise]\nUm and uh that's one thing that is pretty distinctive you hear some in Minnesota and through the Dakotas and in some parts of Canada but that that's a pretty well associated with a with Wisconsin for a lot of people\nOther things are coming through right now so uh most Americans still have a distinction between the man's name Don and the woman's name dawn or words like caught cod and caught the passive to catch\nA but that's going away and it's going away pretty fast and it's something that's happening right now in the state [noise]\nWell these things are evolve or all the time don't to I mean they were our our language is constantly changing the words we use are constantly evolving it would make sense that the way we say things or does to do these happen uh what what causes this evolution\nWell uh there is a has always been as far as we can tell a huge amount of variability in language\nThings are always changing but there's also a big pool of ah variables in speech not everybody speaks the same way\nSo we've got these opportunities to pick up on things and to change a in one direction or another and a lot of these changes that are happening are things that have been going on for a very very long time so the the change with the ab vow\nA that's a characteristic that English has had since before it was really English it goes back to the family it's been happening for\nTwo thousand years in some sense and it it's not exactly the same change because we're starting from different points but it's it's going so it really is it it it is very constant ah how what direction we go in a is determined a lot by adjusting to our peer groups so it's not necessarily that we\nTry to sound like a sorry but we don't try to sound like people on to the radio or television necessarily we tend to would adjust ourselves to uh the people were close to to peer groups to people we identify with\nAnd as you change who you interact with a that gives you a new uh targets to to aim for\n[noise] we we asked people to leave us a voice mail saying a particular sentence so that you could assess just how many Wisconsin characteristics as they exhibit oh let's go to ah let's see we've got a an example from Pam who is from whitewater let's hear that\nLatest report shows John production back with the hot weather now ... fat coming today\nSo Joe what are you hearing here\nSo ah she doesn't have a that much of that sort of an ad report um ah it sounds to me like ag and I looked at it phonetically it it looks like eggs so she doesn't have that much of that particular characteristic\nShe has another characteristic that we find a whole lot now in people from eastern Wisconsin basically east of Madison and up along Lake Michigan\nA pretty far north and that is in words like a news uh she says the Z at the end more or less like an ass so it it sounds like news um\n[noise] a lot of Americans do that invariably a occasionally a but a lot of Wisconsin writes in that part of the state or nail doing that pretty regularly it's pretty it's pretty common feature free speech and she does she does a pretty often\nI I've always been told that that to replace him busy within a disease sound with an ass\nIs a is kind of a product of a of the Scandinavian heritage of a lot of the people who settled a settled in Wisconsin in the in the in the nineteenth century\nUh that's what are you\nHere in Scandinavian communities and ah if you go to the German communities they'll say oh that's a that's because we're German or if you go to polish community say they'll say oh that's super because we found\nPolish a whole lot of languages are that were brought by immigrants to this state in the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century don't have um a Z sound especially at the end of words\nAnd uh so it was not one group necessarily it does show up in those particular areas but it's sort of solidified from those areas and it's now become a broad regional pattern is found by the way outside of the east but I mentioned the eastern part of the state because it's particularly strong there\nOkay let's take a phone call John is a joining us from Richland center John good morning\nGood morning I Lived in Wisconsin all my life I Survived sixty winters here [laughter] and I would like to say I am I'm mid western\nTool towards I Am from Milwaukee\nAnd the old timers used to say I am from middle of a key and we have that these days and don't ... days is these days is they [noise] and to own says do not an\n... John ... thanks for that it also I've heard people drop the elbow from Milwaukee so that comes out like Milwaukee it's it's like people who instead of saying Baltimore they say Baltimore\nYeah so there's a whole lot going on there hum the a replacement of a W sounds by the sounds of something that you have a lot with bilingual Z\nI'm I'm working now with a lot of recordings of Norwegian Americans from Wisconsin or who are bilingual ... and you you get that in a in their speech uh it doesn't survive that much in a monolingual speech once people become only English speaking\nOr they don't tend to have that usually\nI'm with the uh what we often called dim Darren does so them there and those are that's a very strong feature a much like the s a pronunciation\nThat's one that has immigrant roots a lot of these languages that were brought to Wisconsin and early ... don't have the T H sales are ends up like we do and they're very hard for adults to learn and so people made that made that replacement and again it's a case where\nA a feature was not limited to one group it was found across a lot of groups and that makes it easier to get into ordinary speech but what's happened in that case is it's now a ... a John Reilly points it out it points out that it's a it's an old Milwaukee feature\nToday it's become for a lot of people more than a fight with rural parts of the state when I give talks around the state and ask people who says didn't there and does a people whether it's a rural area or an urban area a lot of people will say oh that's a that's something that that uh is more rural today\nAnd with Milwaukee pronounced very briefly that's a wonderful example words that we use a whole lot we tend to save faster we shorten them\nIf you're from a place and the place has a long name then you've got a really good opportunity to shorten it uh so Milwaukee is a perfect example of Louisville in Kentucky a Baltimore the example you gave a those are really good ones\nI think there is a beautiful study to be done taking people from ah Wisconsin in places like managed to walk in a kind of walk and see if they pronounced their old city a shorter than people from other parts of the state do well\nOne of the things I miss about the the Milwaukee Brewers being in the American league as are getting a chance to hear about you could say the Baltimore Orioles um we're talking about that a Wisconsin accent that we have whether we know it or not and we are going to continue that discussion Joe salmon stays with us as we\nTalk about what makes someone from Wisconsin sounds well like someone from Wisconsin\nThat conversation will continue after the it was also Wisconsin attorney general candidates Brad shoveling Josh Caldwell debate for the first time this Friday night at seven thirty ... brings you that debate live moderated by Wisconsin Public television's Frederica primary and WNPR is\nMaryland is there a greeting card for this too I I don't think there is that we find that really that\nWe hear in two thousand and from California I grew up as a military attendant and I gather is on the air force for Twenty years corrupt everywhere\nI kinda think I don't have an accent by students think I had a southern accent I don't personally here that very often but we have three children are all grown now I'll defend our youngest their dialect really didn't shifted off that are middle child who has a CPA in Madison Elliott says mom um\nShe absolutely sounds like she was born and raised here all of their life and she was probably explain when they go\nOn and it's just really shifted it's interesting to see what's in our family with in our household you know one child adopting that dialect and the other is there a reason for that I mean is there what is it about us that they exist more prone to festival to adapt to our dialect ... each other in\nA really good question that's an area where there's a huge amount of research happening right now the kids can adjust a and a lot of kids do adjust and a sixth grade is is pretty much a perfect time for somebody to realign themselves\nUh some of it has to do with the peer group associations you you in in that a pre adolescent adolescent time you really have very strong I'm a peer groups and you really want to a salad like and be like\nA your friends so it probably goes back to a who they were hanging out with and what kind of uh what kind of accidents are those people had but that's a very common thing within families to get differences a by within those set of siblings\nLisa thanks thanks for that call 'em ... is a true some people are just as sort of natural mimics and they ...\nIn I I I find myself doing this whatever group I'm with after an hour I find myself talking\nUh the way they do and I just pretty much can't even help myself which makes a lot of my Canadian friends really laugh when they hear me say a boot or something like that but are some of us are more prone to just kind of blend in that way\nAs the easiest question of the morning for sure yes\nAh some people were really good at it but there as we get older was we're past or early twenties or it's harder to pick up certain things so you can get the basic patterns but if you study somebody's speech you can tell even a somebody who moved to a new place a say in their teens\nOr in a lot of places they will basically sound like they're from there but if you really investigate all of the details of their speech you'll see that they\nThere's some things they have an adjusted to they have it picked up all and so some people were clearly much better at it and I envy those people I have to confess uh but I'm a it's there are limits to to to how good we are at\nThat and I also noticed that at least it pronounced the tea and often is that a regional a thing and where is that from\nOh that is not a regional thing okay ah the word historically never had a tea in it\nBut when English spelling got set they put a tea and it and it's what we call a spelling pronunciation a and I normally don't have many spelling pronunciations those giving a public talk a couple of years ago and somebody asking exactly that question and I said oh that shouldn't be there that's the only people who pay too much attention to spelling [laughter]\nTen minutes later in the ICU and hey\nThe whole audience just went crazy laughing and I said what and they said oh you just said often\n[laughter] oh my goodness okay well I'm Glad to get that classic question answered a let's hear from mark in a ... next mark thanks for joining us on the morning show\nHi greetings there is no I I wanted to make a couple of comments one was about a man of talk and a whole ... whether we're tempted to shorten it up by dropping a constant a nerve I'll\nNot yet out here after twenty five years they do refer to the Thomas ... but that's their sports name but based on what kind of walk but next to Anna talk they definitely where I used to live um have short that up from two rivers\nTo triggers so they they kind of contract that but the comment that I question I have is a study German or regions\nS. T. N. S. P. are often pronounced in those countries with the F ... feel or shtick but\nMy daughter is now in the last couple of years talking about going to strength training and I'm Wondering where this S H creep has come from if it's a local thing or a national thing or just the sloppy thing but uh I hear it's\nEven on news programs from national TV so I'm Wondering if that's where what your opinion is on that\nIt's something that's happening all over the country in a it's a really interesting change for a whole set of reasons or the example you gave is perfect a strength ah descendants that that people read uh had the word strong and it\nUh and if you go back and listen to the three of 'em uh one of them had a pretty much a show\nOne was sort of in between and one had a ... a\nGuy that that drives me crazy when I hear that it's ... it's spreading and I'm Sorry but you're not going to stop it it's just in two generations is gonna is gonna be the norm but it's very specifically for most people like in strength and\nWith S. T. and are some people have generalized it or to just S. T. or S P uh type things but it's mostly in the winters are following\n[noise] I guess I I had either the fortune or misfortune of being raised by a radio announcer to have good diction um and so it bothers me when I don't hear it\nOr we are going to continue our conversation or with Joe ... about this Wisconsin accent thing do you think you have a Wisconsin accent and if so how does it manifest itself or you may be a recent transplant or what do you think about how we talk up here in the north the\nUh and uh uh when we come back I Want to talk about the difference between the actual accident and the stereotype which I just illustrated\nAnd we've got some other stuff to do to so lots to come\nHere on the morning shows so stick around with is Joseph ... co director of the University of Wisconsin Center for the study of upper mid western cultures eight hundred six four to one two three four tell us about your Wisconsin accent I'm John ... and this was the morning show and the ideas network [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nSome flood advisories remain in effect for parts of the state and we're expecting cloudy skies today windy and the north rain likely statewide with some heavy thunderstorms possible in the east and south eyes from the low sixties to the mid seventies getting cooler later in the day\nEarly to mostly cloudy on Thursday rain and snow possible in the northern two thirds of the state hides from the low forties to the low fifties and on friday a mix of sending clouds with temperatures in the forties\nNext on the morning show we explore the history of voting rights and how laws in court rulings play into the rise of voter id and gerrymandering join that conversation up next right here on the ideas network\n[noise]\nThis is Jane ... with NPR's on point Qunu here right here well bluegrass icon of Ricky Skaggs astronaut Scott Kelly punk rocker oh Patti Smith novelist Celeste ... great gas and great conversation and fresh perspective you won't hear anywhere else join us for the next on point\nThis morning at nine on the ideas network\nSupport for WPRI comes from the both company providing professional construction services to customers in a variety of markets nationwide for more than one hundred twenty five years more about market served featured projects and news is that bolt dot com\nSupport also comes from IEDs pizza offering pizza by the slice or whole pies with a variety of gourmet pizza including Mac and cheese drunken ravioli in more information on this week's featured pizza is that ends pizza dot com\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

to but we were discussing the Mississippi Plan and how bad was implemented cloaked in reasonable measures that are that language or if it comes up again and again in your in your book to describe\nHow a lot of these things like the Mississippi Plan were put into practice\nExactly and and so it it seemed reasonable that you wanted people to be literate and and know what their constitutional foundations were but when you do provide funding for education and in many places in the south\nUh there were no high schools for African Americans so then you're taking people who have a massively underfunded education no high school ... whatsoever for education and you're saying read this\nSection of the constitution and interpret it to the liking of the registrar similarly the poll tax where it sounds reasonable\nUm democracy is expensive holding all of these elections are expensive you've got to have people who are there at the polling stations who are collecting the votes you've got to have people who are counting et cetera so it feels only reasonable that people have buy in and that they pay a bit of a a a tax\nIn order to have the have democracy function except when you have massive endemic poverty coming out of centuries of slavery and then um share cropping out of the out of the civil war\nThan asking people to pay\nA who don't have money\nAutomatically creates this massive barrier\nTo their right to vote and the poll tax is the literacy test a word very affected by the time we're in Nineteen forty only three percent of African American adults were registered to vote in the south\n[noise] thrilling and and even if I'm ... uh even if they could pay the poll tax or even if they weren't able to somehow or other um answered the questions of sometimes they couldn't even get somebody to ah to handle their paperwork\nOh absolutely I mean this was you know I've got a a\nAn example in the book of a man who ... who was a coal miner in Alabama and so he goes to register and this is after World War two and he goes to register and the the um uh register I wouldn't even\nAcknowledge him and and finally he's like I Want to I Want to vote it so the register finally hands of the um the paper and he's trying to do his literacy tests and the woman he has done the right to strike just crumbles it up and says you failed\nUm there was the case that went all the way up to the Supreme Court\nUm where a man want it to pay his poll tax but the the the ...\nUm and because they wouldn't accept the payment he couldn't vote because they wouldn't have to pay his poll tax and so he's like my right to vote has been violated by the state I'm trying to pay my poll tax they won't accept\nThe money um what am I doing I'm caught in a catch twenty two here and in the court said yeah we don't see your right to vote being violated their\nUm so one of the things that happens is that the reasonable this helps cloak um the the racist basis of these laws so that the Supreme Court says that the fifteenth amendment is not being violated by the poll tax or the literacy test\nWe have a had a caller John from Green Bay who called in and he had a comment he says the people who want to mobile find a way to vote including people of color your all you hear and respond to adjust to\nAbsolutely because this is how the reasonable in this piece works so let me move up to\nVoter id because that's where it sounds again very reasonable and I first we get the lie of massive ramp and voter fraud and it is a lie it's not massive it's not rampant I'm Greg Abbott and Texas could only point to two cases\nWhen they passed a law in Indiana they had zero cases Kris Kobach couldn't find any cases I mean these are the folks who are the voting voter fraud champions and they can't display anything ...\nI'm looking like rampant or to the courts\nBut what we say is that because we have massive rapid voter fraud you need an id to vote\nWell that settles reasonable except in the states craft the laws so that only certain types of ID are available are are are eligible and these legislatures like the ones in North Carolina\nHave gone through the data to figure out what types of IDs African Americans disproportionately do not have and then make those the IDs\nThat make you eligible to vote so for instance in Alabama\nAlabama said you need to have a government issued photo ID\nAnd then decided that public housing id which is government issued photo ID did not kept Seventy\nOne percent of those in public housing in Alabama or African Americans and for many that's the only ID that they have they don't have the driver's license because cars are expensive\nUm the note the gas the insurance et cetera\nSo disproportionately African Americans do not have the driver's license and so when Alabama sit ... public housing ID doesn't count but your driver's license does then this state shut down the department of motor vehicles\nFor fiscal reasons I'm In the black belt counties now the nearest driver's license bureaus were fifty miles away but if you don't drive and you don't have\nPublic transportation\nHow do you go fifty miles away\nTo get the driver's license\nWant to in poor areas\nMany people who are safe fifty and above were not born in hospitals so they don't have a birth\nCertificate was out the birth certificate so for instance in Indiana you need a birth certificate to get the driver's license but ...\nCertificate you need a driver's license so we it looks simple it's designed to look simple is designed to look at simple as opposed to act it's designed to look as simple as that literacy test\nBut what the states have done is to create an obstacle you need an id but only certain types of ID and then they've created an obstacle to the obstacle\nSo to make it double e difficult to be able to get the id to vote and again the whole rationale for a meeting this id is that is the lie of rampant voter fraud\nAnd married women need a copy of their marriage license if they changed their name when they got married and in many of these states\nYes it so I you know the in Indiana\nFor instance I'm\nSixty percent of the people were turned away\nBecause they didn't have all the documentation that they needed in order to get\nA firm that turned away from the bureau of motor vehicles because they didn't have the documentation and that particularly happens to women where you've got different last names and you're trying to get it all lined up a ... and and this is like make work for something that\nThat ramp and voter fraud many Americans believe that it happened because it's been said so many times in so many ways but it's a mess\nWe will continue this discussion of with Carol Anderson about um uh well the uh the premise of the book of one person no vote how voters depression is destroying\nOur democracy we want to hear from you you think every voter id are a good thing why or why not are you concerned about what you hear about voter fraud or does it exist does not exist or a let us know what you think\nBy calling eight hundred six four to one two three four send us an email the address is ideas of WNPR dot org or you can mention W W PR\nMornings on Twitter\nMy guess is Carolyn Anderson professor at Emory University and author of several books including one person no vote voter suppression is destroying our democracy this Saturday or she will be in Madison as part of the Wisconsin book festival and we'll speak it's seven thirty\nAt the Madison public libraries central branch community rooms three on one and three oh two\nI'm John months and it's the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio station [noise]\nOh what was the voting rights act originally designed to achieve\nWhat it was designed to achieve was to go after the massive this ranch eyes meant that was happening I'm In the south particularly\nUm for African Americans um prior to that time there had been attempts at trying to to break open um this really um oppressive system\nI'm particularly in the right to vote but it required massive litigation\nWhere somebody would have their voting rights violated they'd have to sue the it's the it's been years in court um and and that whole litigation way was not working I'm states would just tweak their laws a bit and then continue to just French fries black voters so we had\nA numerous counties in the south that had large percentages of African American um age eligible African Americans but zero to one who were\nA registered to vote because of the the um voter suppression techniques that were used their\nThe voting rights act said okay enough of this we're going to have states that have a history of um violating discriminating against their citizens in the right to vote\n'em in the way we're going to identify that is that fewer than fifty percent of age eligible adults in that play in that city in that state or a registered to vote and that they use one of those devices coming out of the Mississippi Plan\nWith that than any of those areas that met that criteria then had to have all of their changes to their voting laws approved by the U.S department of justice that's called pre clearance\nPre clearance actually worked um you saw for instance in Mississippi where the um\nPercentage of African Americans that were registered to vote in early Nineteen sixty were in the single digits\nAnd by the time where like in Nineteen sixty seven sixty eight it's almost sixty percent are registered to vote pre clearance worked\nThe Supreme Court and twenty Thirteen gutted pre clearance out of the voting rights act in the Shelby County beholder decision and that is what let loose this this wave of voter suppression particularly in those pre clearance states\nThe it was so the status of the voting rights act today after the Shelby County\nOr is there any is there any a pending action in Congress to fix the things that the court said we're a wrong with the voting rights act or have we done that [laughter]\nThat legislation um is stalled in Congress um the Republicans had not moved it through and they haven't moved it through\nUm because and I've got to go back to Paul Light Rick ... is um the head of alec which was the organization that helped draft a lot of these voter suppression laws then spreading throughout state legislatures\nAnd he's also a one of the founders of the Heritage Foundation and he basically provided the blueprint and his blueprint was we don't want everybody to vote frankly our leverage goes up as the voting population goes down\nAnd that blueprint of restricting the vote depressing demoralizing the electorate so that fewer and fewer people actually vote is the the formula for enhanced\nUm Republican power and so we have a Republican controlled Congress and so legislation to\n'em for the voting rights act has actually stalled in Congress\nLet's take a phone call here John is with us from Eau Claire John good morning\nHello yes go ahead okay\nSo uh I Am a social studies teacher here no Claire and I am a recent graduate of part of my studies here at all clear included a lot of work in the archives\nAnd one of the interesting things I found in there that are related to what your guest was saying about your literacy tests in the south\nSo I stumbled across the bin ... filled\nWith rejection justification for people registering to vote in the south after taking a leader at and one that stood out to me the most was that there was one that simply said applicant said it is rather than it was and that was their reasoning for denying\nThat person their right to vote so this idea of hiding behind rational sounding ideas is definitely true we have all sorts of evidence that so I just wanted to call in and share that a little bit\nAnd John thanks for the call Carol Anderson\nYeah thank you um [noise] it it it it it is mind boggling I'm a man that I Know who grew up in the Jim Crow south said he tried to register to vote and um the question that he got 'em if he's going through his last re tests and they're looking at him and they said okay so how far is up\nAny what scares me [laughter] I like how far is up there like ... you didn't answer the question of registration denied\n\nIt's like asking how often is awesome\nExactly [laughter] I'm In Mississippi one of the questions was um how many bubbles in a bar of soap\nAmazing yeah\nWe're talking with Carol Anderson a about disenfranchisement a she's the author of one person no vote how voters depression is

I of having these arms for only eight months a year right the are the main driving people that will be able to buy it and now the theory is\nBecause we're focusing on accents today I wanted to make sure that we got this side of the way first what is the difference between an accent and a dialect\nOh that's a really good question uh an accident or refers basically to pronunciation whereas dialect involves words and sentence structures and things like that\nSo I'm I'm from the south and I will you may hear it to some extent or other I have a southern accent but I also use different words I use different pronouns I so y'all instead of you for a plural\nUm and uh I have a different grammar or I can say things like you should do that [noise] ah so those are accident as a much more focused term [noise]\nWell I have to say that as your accent doesn't sound very southern to me but I'm a a maybe after we talk for a while a pick that up uh so what are the characteristics of the Wisconsin accent as we know it today\n[noise] well uh it's changing very rapidly and they're very new first of all so things are just in some ways starting to emerge\nUh a couple of things that you hear a lot in Wisconsin include a people having a distinctive pronunciation of that ad vow all of the vowing bad in bats and so forth specifically when it comes before a G\nSo people will talk about the stereotype of Wisconsin I how Wisconsin I say bag\nUm and uh that's one thing that is pretty distinctive you hear some in Minnesota and through the Dakotas and in some parts of Canada but that that's a pretty well associated with a with Wisconsin for a lot of people other things are coming through\nMost Americans still have a distinction between the man's name Don and the woman's name dawn or words like caught cod and caught the past sensitive to catch a but that's going away and it's going away pretty fast and it's something that's happening right now in the state\n[noise] well these things evolve or all the time don't they I mean they were our our language is constantly changing the words we use are constantly evolving it would make sense that the way we say things or does to do these happened uh uh what what causes this evolution\nWell uh there is a has always been as far as we can tell a huge amount of variability in language or like you say things are always changing but there's also a big pool of uh variables in speech not everybody speaks the same way\nSo we've got these opportunities to pick up on things and to change\nA in one direction or another and a lot of these changes that are happening are things that have been going on for a very very long time so the the change with the ad vow a that's a characteristic that English has had since before it was really English it goes back to the family it's been happening for\nTwo thousand years in some sense and it it's not exactly the same change because we're starting from different points but it's it's going so it really is is it it it is very constant ah how what direction we go in a is determined a lot by adjusting to our peer groups so it's not necessarily that we\nTry to sound like a sorry but we don't try to sound like people on the radio or television necessarily we tend to would adjust ourselves to uh the people were close to to peer groups to people we identify with\nAnd as you change who you interact with a that gives you a new uh targets to to aim for\n[noise] we we asked people to leave us a voice mail saying a particular sentence so that you could assess just how many Wisconsin characteristics as they exhibit oh let's go to a let's say we've got a an example from Pam who is from whitewater let's hear that\nLatest report shows John production back like hot weather now ... coming today\nSo Joe what are you hearing here so uh she doesn't have a that much of that so in ag report um [noise] uh it sounds to me like ag and I looked at it phonetically it it looks like eggs so she doesn't have that much of that particular characteristics\nShe has another characteristic that we find a whole lot now in people from eastern Wisconsin basically east of Madison and up along Lake Michigan a pretty far north and that is a in words like a news\nAh she says the Z at the end more or less like an ass so it it sounds like news um\nA lot of Americans do that invariably a occasionally ah but ah a lot of Wisconsin writes in that part of the state are now doing that pretty regularly it's pretty it's pretty common feature free speech and she does she does a pretty often\nI I've always been told that that to replace him busy within a disease sound with an ass is a is kind of a product of a of the Scandinavian heritage of a lot of the people who settled a settled in Wisconsin in the in the in the nineteenth century\n[noise] uh that's what are you hearing\nScandinavian communities and ah if you go to the German communities they'll say oh that's a that's because we're German or if you go to polish community say they'll say oh that's super because we sound polish\nA whole lot of languages are that were brought by immigrants to the state in the nineteenth century\nI have um a Z sound especially at the ends of words\nAnd uh so it was not one group necessarily it does show up in those particular areas but it's sort of solidified from those areas and it's now become abroad regional pattern is found by the way outside of the east but I mentioned the eastern part of the state because it's particularly strong there\nOkay let's take a phone call John is a joining us from Richland center John good morning\n[noise] good morning [noise] I Lived in Wisconsin all my life I Survived sixty winters here [laughter] and I would like to say I am I'm mid western [noise] um [noise] ... tool towards\nI Am from Milwaukee\nAnd the old timers used to say I am from middle of a key and we have that these days and don't ... days is these days is they [noise] and ... says do not an\nEdge on that thanks for that it also I've heard people drop the elbow from Milwaukee so that comes out like Milwaukee it's it's like people who instead of saying Baltimore they say Baltimore\nYeah so there's a whole lot going on there um the a replacement of a W sounds by V. sounds is something that you have a lot with bilingual Z\nI'm I'm working now with a lot of recordings of Norwegian Americans from Wisconsin or who are bilingual ... and you you get that in a in their speech or it doesn't survive that much in a monolingual speech once people become only English speaking\nOr they don't tend to have that usually\nI'm with the uh what we often call them there and does so them there and those\nUh that's a very strong feature a much like the s a pronunciation that's one that has immigrant roots a lot of these languages that were brought to Wisconsin and early ... don't have the T H sales with a ... like we do\nAnd they're very hard for adults to learn and so people made that made that replacement and again it's a case where\nA a feature was not limited to one group it was found across a lot of groups and that makes it easier to get into ordinary speech but what's happened in that case is it's now a ... a John Reilly points it out it points out that it's a it's an old Milwaukee feature\nToday it's become for a lot of people more identified with rural parts of the state when I give talks around the state and ask people who says didn't there and does a people whether it's a rural area or an urban area a lot of people will say oh that's a that's something that that uh is more rural today\nAnd with Milwaukee pronounced very briefly that's a wonderful example words that we use a whole lot we tend to save faster we short in them\nIf you're from a place and the place has a long name then you've got a really good opportunity to shorten it uh so Milwaukee is a perfect example of Louisville in Kentucky a Baltimore the example you gave a those are really good ones\nI think there's a beautiful study to be done taking people from ah Wisconsin in places like Manitowoc an economy walk and see if they pronounced their old city a shorter than people from other parts of the state do\nWell one of the things I miss about the the Milwaukee Brewers being in the American league as are getting a chance to hear Bob ... said the Baltimore Orioles\nUm we're talking about that a Wisconsin accent that we have whether we know it or not and we are going to continue that discussion Joe salmon stays with us as we talk about\nWell like someone from Wisconsin that conversation will continue after news also Wisconsin attorney general Kennedy Brad Sherman Josh call will debate for the first time this Friday night at seven thirty ... brings you the debate live moderated by Wisconsin Public television Frederica primary WPRI\nShawn Johnson the head of a debate joined us for a special but looks at the Wisconsin candidates for US Senate that's friday night at seven followed by the debate it's seven thirty I'm John ... is the morning show on the ideas network [noise]\nIs there a greeting card for this thing too I I don't think there is that we don't really have\nWe live here and there hasn't been here from California I grew up as a military independent and I doubt that an air force for Twenty years corrupt everywhere\nI kinda think I don't have an accent by students think I had a southern accent I don't personally here that very often but we have three children are all grown now all this and our youngest their dialect really didn't shifted off that are middle child who is a CPA and Madison alec says mom on\nShe absolutely sounds like she was born and raised here all of their life and she was probably I think the next grade when they got here\nAnd it's just really shifted interact with our family but then our household you know one child adopting that die like on the other is is there a reason for that I mean is there is [noise] what is it about us that they exist more prone to festival to adapting our dialect ...\nA really good question that that's an area where there's a huge amount of research happening right now the kids can adjust a and a lot of kids do adjust and a sixth grade\nRealign themselves\nAh some of it has to do with the peer group associations you you in in that a pre adolescent adolescent time you really have very strong I'm a peer groups and you really want to a salad like and be like\nA your friends so it probably goes back to a who they were hanging out with and what kind of uh what kind of accents are those people had but that's a very common thing within families to get differences a by ... within the set of siblings\nLisa thanks thanks for that call 'em ... is it true some people are just as sort of natural mimics and they tend to just a blend in I I I find myself doing this whatever group I'm with I after an hour I find myself talking\nUh the way they do and I just pretty much can't even help myself\nA which makes a lot of my Canadian friends really laugh when they hear me say a boot or something like that but are some of us are more prone to just kind of blend in that way\nAs the easiest question of the morning for sure yes ah some people were really good at it but there as we get older was where past um our early twenties or it's harder to pick up certain things so you can get the basic patterns\nBut if you study somebody's speech you can tell even or somebody who moved to a new place a say in their teens\nOr in a lot of places they will basically sound like they're from there but if you really investigate all the details of their speech you'll see that they\nThere's some things they have an adjusted to they have it picked up all and so some people were clearly much better at it and I envy those people I have to confess ah but I'm a it's there are limits to to to how good we are at\nThat and I also noticed that a lease it pronounced the tea and often is that a regional a thing and where is that from\nOh that is not a regional thing okay ah the word historically never had a tea in it\nBut when English spelling got set they put a tea and ... and it's what we call a spelling pronunciation a and I normally don't have many spelling pronunciation those giving all public talk a couple of years ago and somebody asking exactly that question and I said oh that shouldn't be there that's the only people who pay too much attention to spelling [laughter]\nTen minutes later in the queue and ate the whole audience just went crazy laughing and I said what and they said oh you just said often [laughter]\nOh my goodness okay well I'm Glad to get that classic question answered a let's hear from mark in a ... next mark thanks for joining us on the morning show\nHi

T. and are some people have generalize to uh to just S.
