C. welcome Barbara\nThank you I'm Glad to be here\nAnd a Brigitte ... is special project reporter at Wisconsin Public radio she's also project manager of beyond the ballot and Bridget thanks again for being with us ... thanks for having me\nBridget today we're exploring healthcare and well beyond the ballot isn't a scientific study give us a sense of how much people are thinking about this issue what do we know from those who have participated in beyond the ballot\nRight so one of the question we're asking as part of our beyond that project is what is the single most important issue to you next election season and I gotta say healthcare is a ... either number one or number two at science issues that people bring up it's something that people care about\n'em in every corner of the state and people as every political ideology it's on their mind that election season\nBridget let's let's turn to how to Wisconsin I too are sharing their stories as part of beyond the ballot tell us about a time when the\nBridget oh let's turn to Crystal's Zimmerman another Wisconsin I'd who shared her story is part of the beyond the ballot project what did she have to say [noise]\nUm so we talked to some people who are very much in favor of the things that the government has done recently in terms of health care policy um that crystal Zimmerman of Beloit um disagrees with many interesting so let's take a listen to what she has to say\nHaving worked in health care and the government has um done some things that have made healthcare more expensive and I'm I'm\nNot in favor of some of the ways the government has\nKind of force hospitals and health care institutions into electronic medical records and all sorts of different certifications and um [noise]\nYou know just things that keep increasing\nThe cost of healthcare but it is not directly um beneficial to the patient\nBarbara how do rising costs for healthcare play into this conversation\nBoth the huge concern for a lot of people not just you know consumers but um for people who are in the industry I'm others you know ... it's um an enormous problem you know health care is about Eighteen percent\nOf our gross domestic product um that means they spend\nEighteen percent of all the dollars in the United states on healthcare which leaves little less money for spending on education and you know the environment and other\nTypes of a public good so um it's it's a huge concern and I agree with crystal that there's a lot of red tape in health care um you know there's a lot of\nDifferent sides to each of those issues and because you have so many stakeholders in the system who aren't always I'm at agreements with each other on how we should spend the money\nOr let's take a phone call let's go to Jean in um lake bills Jean good morning welcome to the morning show\nYes go ahead so Microsoft is my my son's ... hey actually went up which was a wonderful thanks a lot of dollars an hour to Fifteen dollars an hour because of the ...\nBeen helping and pay us health care through you know plans on health care that goes since all of the Bible care started and it's been very grateful that we've been able to have something forward about but\nI haven't seen the difference in calling them in a plant or someone making eleven dollars an hour some make even a dollar\nOr two more per hour I\nLiterally been scared to death he does call because I Hope in on that and to to ask 'cause it's a great corrected for what he makes now because I Know even between the two of us we probably will be able to afford it it'll probably just three or four hundred dollars a month\nSo what I'm Wondering is the mandate has gone away for people to have health care is there anything we going to get hit with still hit with a tremendously large fell for underpaying\nBut last year even though we did everything totally by the lie and we ended up with a three hundred and fifty nine dollar\nUnder payments so at the end of the air\nOn which then he got harassed for the last two months about not paying you know we had it it just loves to prove it and they were trying to tell him he had to pay it or get fined and all that stuff he just got a letter yesterday saying that was they cleaned up so scared next year we're going to have one for Fifteen hundred dollars or something\nOr Gina thanks for sharing that story Bridget affordability definitely on the mind of Wisconsin I just tell us about Rebecca ... take on this part of the issue\nRight Rebecca is from the nominee and again when we asked her what her top issue in this election season here's what she said\nHealthcare is probably a big one for me because it's really not very affordable to middle class families we definitely be fought with an insurance company to get a medical care that was very necessary\nTo be paid for and it was not paid for we had to fight all the way to the end to finally get it paid for by a secondary insurance company and it was really nerve wracking for the whole family because the person who needed the care\nAlmost lost it and then in the last minute they were able to get the care but at the whole time it was very stressful\nAnd Rebecca and our caller Jean aren't the only ones thinking about how expensive health care is Bridget let's bring Rhonda Olson in here to\nWrite Ron ... Olsen is from a Claire and she actually works in the health care field and um she also concerned about the cost and things that needs to change\nI see a lot of people who can't afford their medications that can't afford 'em treatments cannot see positions because they have an adequate coverage or no coverage at all [noise]\nAnd then their health suffers and and they end up paying more in the long run\n... what's your reaction to all of this a gene a gene issue with her son's health insurance going up and having to make payments on a on a on more\nUh and worried that without the mandates that to her son's insurance bill is going to skyrocket and then there's the two uh uh people that we heard from here as well uh what's your reaction about all the costs associated with health care and how is that affecting the way we think about this issue\nYeah I think a health care costs are topless mind as demonstrated by the color callers from the show and I'm you know the ... tried\nTo find a happy medium with cost a so there are winners and losers when it came to cost there were people who had preexisting conditions who didn't have coverage beef or who are now because of the ... have coverage that costs them less than it would have\nAnd then those people who uh dog have pre existing conditions because of the Ford will ... probably pay more than they otherwise have\nBecause of this community rating provision under the Affordable CARE Act and um you know the caller was right that it's her spine decide not to have health insurance he next year he wouldn't have to pay a penalty for\nNot having health insurance but um you know it's not a river a good idea to go without health insurance because it is so costly and unfortunately\nIt's costly because consumers are really insulated from the\nCare because of insurance [laughter] so um it without the government having to step in and really controlling prices um these costs are kind of ... unabated and um it's it's it's a really tough tough issue\nOf let's take another call Susan is with us in la crescent Minnesota Susan good morning go ahead\nI um I probably should have mentioned that I'm I'm a a like a whole ... because they work in La Crosse Wisconsin for my clients come from Wisconsin but anyhow\nUm I work with a very a severely mentally ill or clans and uh the therapy that I Do get some better so they can go to work and unfortunately a lot of times when they start working\nTo make too much money and then they get cut off like badger care and stuff like that so\nThen they can't afford the mental health care which is stabilizing them so that they can remain in their job so it ends up being kind of a cycle where they literally have to stop working or greatly reduced hours\nOr in order to maintain the health insurance yet then they can't pay their rent and you know so it's just this incident feedback loops that they get stuck in\nSusan thanks for sharing the ... like there are a lot of a catch twenty two examples here are including the one that Susan sites about getting mental health and that's an issue we haven't talked about unfortunately we don't have a lot of time to discuss it or do you think of that too We're ever going to do anything about those\nYou know I'm hopeful that we will uh and I use the example of the existing conditions are as evidence that people from all sides of the political aisle can come together and in a unified voice say we want\nProtection than health care and pre existing conditions was one of those protections that Republicans independents and Democrats\nI'm In the majority of whom agree that those protections should be in place and so I think was enough education and advocacy 'em by the different stakeholders in healthcare we can come to a consensus that\nMental health care and health care generally should be something everybody has access to\nBarbara thank you Bridget if people want to share what they're thinking about regarding health care this election season quickly how can they get involved\nThey can call us at age seven seven seven eight to eight nine for two and if you've tried to call that number in the past and it hasn't worked we have that problem so that's it's seven seven seven eight to eight nine for two\nSo you you mentioned a lone wolf a acts of violence these things don't happen in a vacuum so what else is going on here\nYeah I think I'm look I think we should all be asking ourselves that question I mean how how could this happen and what is this revealing about about our society right now and I think at the same time you know we don't want to jump to conclusions about\nExactly what motivated these individuals' um but that said I think we we can you know fairly surmise that\nThey are drawing from um the broader political environment and they are drawing from ideas that they're getting access to online or in the public space\nUm and those ideas are either reinforcing\nOr enhance thing or enabling or legitimizing their views and I think that's you know that's the that's what should give us all pause and I think that it's really important right now for anyone in public office or anyone who is in the media or anyone who has a [noise]\nYou know public role to to exercise tremendous care and caution in the language that they use\nAnd then thinking about a in those societies where we're terrorism is president and active and unfortunately our seems to be one of them\nAre are there is some commonalities or there's some common traits across those societies\n[noise] um [noise] yes and no I think I think you can see commonalities among among some of the individuals I mean this or typical process of radicalization would be that you have an individual who is sort of alienated or humiliated has a sense of victimization\nAnd then latches onto a set of ideas and uh uh belonging to a group and the ... subscribing to a particular ideology or ideas\nAnd I'm thinking that there's going to be salvation in in um acting on those ideas and taking matters into their own hands\nKnow from what I Know and I think there's still a lot to learn here I think that pattern seems to fit a fit and what happened recently in the United states unfortunately um I think that you know beyond that\nIt's hard to same UC terrorism and in the context of civil war you see it in an authoritarian countries you see in democratic countries you see it in higher income countries you see at low income countries so I think in terms of the kind of countries in which happens as far as I Know there's not a clear answer to you know is there a particular country which occurs\nScott's draws is the violence distinguished achievement professor of political science and International Studies at a\nYou W Madison and we're talking about political violence in America and what you know where it's coming from and what to perhaps what even a might be done about it\nWondering what you think about all of this eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four uh join our conversation\nYou've mentioned a terrorism and radicalization are those are terms that we probably didn't even think about uh thirty forty years ago I mean is a and and yet now they have become common\nA comment and discussions about these issues ah any thoughts on kind of how we progressed to this point where we have ah people being radicalized and feeling empowered to actually take action and commit violence against their fellow human beings\nI think you know I think that the right question to be asking and I don't I certainly don't have all the answer is I think that [noise] you know there is a current in American politics today that\nIt strikes me as extremely dangerous and and um and what we're seeing through these incidences that there are people with deeply bigoted views are who are having their ideas reinforced on line or reinforced in the public sphere and hum are feeling a bolt into act\nUm [noise] you know I I I think you know I don't think we're at an epidemic level amazing\nThese incidents happened together and they're drawing attention to them but I think it's very worrisome and very scary um and and it should be a real real wakeup call I don't you know to to answer your question I think that [noise] um\nYeah I don't think there's a clear reason why we're in this position and why terrorism has become more common parlance certainly after nine eleven and the United states I think I think it that that particular incident drew a lot of attention in the United states to terrorism but if you were to go around the world whether it be Israel whether it be\nAh the United kingdom or other place we long ago\nThat uh there are longer histories of terrorism where these ideas and these concepts for one more present than in the United states\nIt seems like both the seeds are a second I'm Robert Bowers were influenced by ideas they got on an online communities should we be concerned about that I mean are there are ways to curb that kind of speech and is that even something we could consider\n[noise] I think I think we should be concerned about it for sure and I think one of the things that that seems true about\nThe the these social networks is that they tend to increase polarization they tend to reinforce views they allow people to uh I think to to develop extreme ideas and and feel as if they are validated in those ideas by finding other people on line [noise]\nUm [noise] the question of how you control them is a really difficult one I think you're seeing some of the larger social media companies like Facebook and Twitter who are getting more I'd say aggressive in the way in which they are trying to ...\nA speech that or postings that would um incite violence or that are deliberately false information at the same time I think you have to be really careful about\nYou know you don't want these companies to be the grand arbiters of speech and the United states which is a very long history of of supporting a free and open dialogue and speech um and I think they're in a tough spot\nUm [noise] I think that the reason why a term like terrorism I think can be helpful in this context is that I think it it it points to the seriousness\nOf the issue and I think that it would I think\nA prompt more resources and attention to the kind of hateful and violent rhetoric that's happening in some of that dark corners of the Web and and again I think they should you know these incidents should really should be a wakeup call for all of us happening [noise]\nOur conversation about political violence continues its the morning show on the ideas networks guns drawn says the bond as distinguished

properties\nAnd that that costs to ... it's more so focused on uh how much it costs to build a property on you subtract appreciation on Monday income approach is where it examines on\nIt it looks at how much income property actually generate fat so there is those three approaches that the kind of have already present in Wisconsin so that those are other areas to consider it to you when the campuses you\nWell I guess another way to look at it from a homeowner perspective is a vacant house worth the same thing as one that's occupied\nIn terms of how we assessed property\n\nOnly a counter argument guy they ate he jak contract he meant that that's been raised during the ... to\nAh so ah currently kind of sums up what opponents are saying about the campaign against the dark stores or at a loophole we had voters weighing in you mentioned in the August primary west Alice voters approved\nDo you have a what are you watching for as we are as we move forward euro Brianna\nWell there are a couple of things actually so I'm basically one thing that I think a lot of people are curious about is where Governor Walker and democratic challenger twenty either stand on on this issue and we've seen that putting some other media outlets already that both\nThe governor and his his challenger twenty hours are supportive of Dexter legislation on\nWe're also continuing to see this ongoing ad campaign from illegal but it's got to tell it is a it was ... county dissociation association\nThey're all they're all supportive of legislation to close this so called tax loophole oh you know the campaign was first launched in August so it was really trying to encourage community is to put this issue on the ballot put this clip voters have done it ... and perhaps compel legislators tap\nOne way or the other day um but you know one of the looking at the ... says communities where this question is on the ballot it\nReally ranges it's up all across the state and we have one in Dade County for example and brown county in the northeastern part of the state capital in ... in southeast Wisconsin then I'm Lester why sprint kind\nYou might be an example of that area at the state and so it it's really going to be an issue that's come up before a lot of voters\nAnd that will continue to watch this along with your brand I originally is a reporter for which politics thank you so much for joining us thank you\n[noise]\nWith just one week left until the election Wisconsin Public Radio's beyond the ballot initiative is going strong we're asking people about the issues that are important to them this election season\nA recurring theme among some Wisconsin I Choose Governor Scott Walker's landmark collective bargaining law known as act ten passed in ... the last deal provoked strong feelings\nWNPR Shawn Johnson reports\nIt's been more than seven years since Governor Scott Walker first introduced the bill now known as ... ten they'd all been eliminated the union rights of most public employees seven years since protesters flooded the capital\nAnd unions vowed revenge when I say you have power\nAnd it's been more than six years since people voted in Wisconsin's recall election race walk or one\nVoters really do want leaders who stand up and they the tough decisions [noise]\nAnd yet over the course of twenty Eighteen when Wisconsin Public radio spoke to voters around the state act ten is still something they remember\nWell A.Q Khan certainly hurt\nPeople in in the public sector and me included\nOne of the questions WPRI is beyond the ballot project asks everyone is whether there's a time when the government hurt them that's when Pittsburgh city worker guest band or weekend brings back ten\nMy paid in ... but I had to pay for that extra\nTrunk of retirement and\nWhatever so that if there were is was effect of paid rock that I had we had an recovered from\nThat's also when former Beloit city worker Gary Zimmerman brings up back to Penn\nAs I was a public employee for thirty six years [noise]\nThe unions\nAs far as my rights of due number ... a lot of my rights as you remember too that\nBy the Peterson a Chippewa falls used to belong to a union for her job in local government not any more\nReally wasn't any reason to participate anymore\nAll right and these are all stories people volunteer some remember their unions vividly that's kept pressure on Democrats to remember act tend to walkers democratic challenger Tony ... says if he's elected he'll repeal the law piece by piece\nI was against that can right from the beginning I Would support repealing it but we just can't wait we have to make those buildings locked put those building blocks in place\nFor Walker at ten remains his calling card\nAt my ...\nWe kept their power away and give it to the\nBook talks about efforts to repeal the law about as much as Democrats do polling from Marquette University has consistently found the public divided over act Ken although the divide is largely partisan is popular with Republican voters like walk shot resident carry Colton who's a superintendent at a cemetery\nCult in things government unions were too powerful before acts ten\nSo when a union becomes more powerful than [noise]\nThe people of the state they\nWill horse politicians to pass laws in their favor which don't really held an entire [noise]\nPeople to stay\nFor others unions are something they've only heard about but never experienced like elementary school teacher Jeff David who didn't teach in Wisconsin until after act ten\nI came into education in two thousand eleven [noise] um so I I saw [noise]\nThe protests happening in Madison against and and I and I read about it so I guess I never really experienced [noise]\nWhat kind of opportunities I could have had as a professional teaching\nReact to other issues are dominating the twenty teen campaign for governor but the debate over unions and at ten is still simmering Shawn Johnson Wisconsin Public

New Jersey just uh the previous year in Nineteen thirty seven and a very famous clip her was out there to record sound effects which was a new concept of the time\nAnd suddenly he has this major disaster that he is recording and voicing oh the humanity of that famous line from that\nAnd up Frank Reddick who played Carl Philips in world the world's listened to her ... recording of that actuality over and over to get it just right and so you know when you think about people who had heard\nOr some cases seen the news ... of the Hynden bird and just a year later they're hearing something like a Carl's Philips reporting on getting incinerator by Martians not so big a leap for some people\n... ...

C. welcome Barbara\nThank you I'm Glad to be here and I'm a Brigitte ... is special project reporter at Wisconsin Public radio she's also project manager of beyond the ballot Bridget thanks again for being with us\n... thanks for having me\nBridget today we're exploring healthcare and well beyond the ballot is into scientific study give us a sense of how much people are thinking about this issue what do we know from those who have participated in beyond the ballot\nRight so one of the question we're asking is part of our beyond that project is\nWhat is the single most important issue to you next election season and I gotta say health care is a ... either number one or number two as far as issues that people bring up something that people care about 'em in every corner of the state and people as every political ideology it's on their mind that election season\nBridget let's let's turn to how to Wisconsin I toured sharing their stories as part of beyond the ballot tell us about a town like\nBridget oh let's turn to crystal Zimmerman another Wisconsin I'd who shared her story is part of the beyond about project what did she have to say [noise]\nUm so we talked to some people who are very much in favor of the things that the government has done recently in terms of health care policy um ... crystals Yemen of Beloit ... disagrees with many I'm testing so let's take a listen to what she has to say\nWorked in health care and the government\nDone some things that have made health care more expensive and I'm I'm\nNot in favor of some of the ways that government has\nKind of force hospitals and health care institutions into electronic medical records and on all sorts of different\nCertifications and um [noise]\nYou know just things that keep increasing\nThe cost of health care if a it\nIs and not directly um beneficial to the patient\nBarbara how do rising costs for healthcare play into this conversation\nBoth a huge concern for a lot of people not just you know consumers but um for people who are in the industry I'm now there's stakeholders it's\nI'm an enormous problem you know health care is about Eighteen percent of our gross domestic product that means they spend Eighteen percent of all the dollars in the United states on healthcare\nA which leaves little less money for spending on educational you know the environment and other types of a public but so um it's it's a huge\nWith crystal that there's a lot of red tape in health care um you know there's a lot of different sides to each of those issues and because we do have so many stakeholders in the system who aren't always I'm at agreements with each other on how we should spend the money\nOh let's take a phone call let's go to a gene in um wake meals Jean good morning welcome to the morning show\nHigh school so my\nCrushed and is my my sons and K actually went up which was a wonderful thing from eleven dollars an hour to Fifteen dollars an hour\nBecause of the income was so low as it was so much I've been helping and pay us health care through you know plans on health care that goes and all of the bottle care started and has been very grateful that we've been able to have something affordable but\nI haven't seen the difference in calling them in a plant or something and make an eleven dollars an hour some make even a dollar or two more per hour\nI literally been scared to death even call because I can help him on that and to to ask to to get a\nRate corrected for what he makes now because I Know even between the two of us we probably won't be able to afford it it'll probably just three or four hundred dollars a month so what I'm Wondering is the mandate has gone away for people to have health care is there anything\nWe going to get hit with still hit with a tremendously large scale for underpaying they last year even though we did everything totally by the line and we ended up with a three hundred and fifty million dollar under payments so at the end of the air\nOn which then he got harassed for the last two months about not paying you know we had it it just loves to prove it and they were trying to tell me at the pay it or get behind and all that stuff you just got a letter yesterday saying that was state cleaned up so scared next year we're going to have one for Fifteen hundred dollars or something\nOr Gina thanks for sharing the story Bridget affordability definitely on the mind of Wisconsin I just tell us about Rebecca ... take on this part of the issue\nRight Rebecca is from the nominee and again when we asked her what her top issue in this election season here's what she said healthcare\nIs probably a big one for me because it's really not very affordable to middle class families we definitely be fought with an insurance company to get a medical care that was very necessary\nTo be paid for and it was not paid for we had to fight all the way to the end to finally get it paid for by a secondary insurance company and it was really nerve wracking for the whole family because the person who needed the care\nAlmost lost it and then in the last minute they were able to get the care but at the whole time it was very stressful\nAnd Rebecca and our caller Jean aren't the only ones thinking about how expensive health care is Bridget let's bring Rhonda Olson in here to\nWrite Ron ... Olsen is from Claire and she actually works in the health care field and um she also is concerned about the cost and things that needs to change\nI see a lot of people who can't afford their medications that can't afford 'em treatments cannot see positions because they have an adequate coverage or no coverage at all [noise]\nAnd then their health suffers and they end up paying more in the long run\n... what's your reaction to all of this a gene a gene issue with her son's health insurance going up and having to make payments on a on a on more er and worried that without the mandates\nAnd then there's the to the people that we heard from here as well uh what's your reaction about all the costs associated with health care and how is that affecting the way we think about this issue\n[noise] yeah I think um health care costs are top of mind as demonstrated by the color and call her from the show and I'm you know the\n... tried to find a happy medium with costs a so there are winners and losers when it came to cost there were people who had preexisting conditions who didn't have coverage beef or who now because of the ...\nI have coverage that costs them less than it would have otherwise because of the tree existing condition then those people who\nUh dog have pre existing conditions him because of the cause for double ... probably pay more than they otherwise have\nBecause of this community rating prevention under the Affordable CARE Act and um you know the caller was right that it's her spine decide not to have health insurance he\nNext year he wouldn't have to pay a penalty for not having health insurance but um you know it's not a river a good idea to go without health insurance because it is so costly and unfortunately it's costly because consumers are really insulated from the\nCare because of insurance [laughter] so um it without the government having to step in and really controlling prices um these costs are kind of\nIncreasing unabated and um it's it's it's a really tough tough issue\nOh let's take another call Susan is with us in la crescent Minnesota Susan good morning go ahead [noise]\nSo um I probably should have mentioned that I'm I'm a a like a whole Sarah post their work in La Crosse Wisconsin for my clients come from Wisconsin but anyhow um I work with a very a severely mentally ill\nAh clans and uh the therapy that I Do get some better so they can go to work and unfortunately a lot of times when they started working to make too much money and then they get cut off like badger care and stuff like that so then they can't afford the mental health care which is stabilizing them\nSo that they can remain in their job\nSo it ends up being kind of a cycle where they literally have to stop working or greatly reduced or hours\nOr in order to maintain the health insurance yet then they can't pay their rent and you know so it's just this incident feedback loops that they get stuck in\nSusan thanks for sharing that ... like there are a lot of a catch twenty two examples here including the one that choose insights about getting mental health and that's an issue we haven't talked about unfortunately we don't have a lot of time to discuss it do you think you know the two were ever going to do anything about those\nYou know I'm hopeful that we will uh and I use the example of preexisting conditions are as evidence that people\nFrom all sides of the political aisle can come together and in a unified voice say we want protection than health care and pre existing conditions was one of those protection\nThat Republicans independents and Democrats I'm In the majority of whom agree that those protections should be in place and so\nI think with enough education and advocacy 'em by the different stakeholders in healthcare we can come to a consensus that\nMental health care and health care generally should be something\nBarbara thank you Bridget if people want to share what they're thinking about regarding health care this election season not quickly how can they get involved\nThey can call that eight seven seven seven eight to eight nine ... and if you've tried to call that number in the past and it hasn't worked we have fix that problem so that it's having seven seven eight to eight nine four kill\nTo you you mentioned a lone wolf a acts of violence these things don't happen in a vacuum so what else is going on here\nYeah I think I'm look I think we should all be asking ourselves that question I mean how how could this happen and what is this revealing about about our society right now and\nI think at the same time you know we don't want to jump to conclusions about exactly what motivated these individuals' um but that said I think we we can you know fairly surmise that\nThey are drawing from um the broader political environment and they are drawing from ideas that they're getting access to online or in the public space\nUm and those ideas are either reinforcing or enhance thing or ... or legitimizing their views\nAnd I think that's you know that's the that's what should give us all pause and I think that it's really important right now for anyone in public office or anyone who is in the media or anyone who has it you know public relative to exercise tremendous care and caution in the language that they use\nAnd then thinking about uh\nIs president and active and unfortunately our seems to be one of them are are there some commonalities or there's some common traits across those societies\n[noise] um [noise] yes and no I think I think you can see commonalities among among some of the individuals I mean this or typical process of radicalization would be that you have an individual who is sort of alienated or humiliated has a sense of victimization\nAnd then latches onto a set of ideas and uh uh belonging to a group and its subscribing to a particular ideology or ideas\nAnd I'm thinking that there's going to be salvation in in um acting on those ideas and taking matters into their own hands on and so I think you know from what I Know and and I think there's still a lot to learn here I think that pattern seems to fit a fit and what happened recently the United states unfortunately\nUm I think that you know beyond that it's hard to same UC terrorism and in the context of civil war you see it an authoritarian countries you see in democratic countries you see it in higher income countries have low income countries so I think in terms of the kind of countries in which it happens\nAs far as I Know there's not a clear answer to you know is there a particular country in which occurs\nScott's draws is the violence distinguished achievement professor of political science and International Studies at a you W Madison and we're talking about political violence in America and what you know where it's coming from and what to perhaps what even a might be done about it\nWondering what you think about all of this eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four or join our conversation\nYou've mentioned a terrorism and radicalization are those are terms that we probably didn't even think about uh thirty forty years ago I mean is a and and yet now they have become common\nA comment and discussions about these issues or any thoughts on kind of how we progressed to this point where we have people being radicalized and feeling empowered to actually take action and commit violence against their fellow human beings\nI think you know I think that's the right question to be asking and I don't I certainly don't have all the answers I think that [noise] you know there is a current in American politics today that\nIt strikes me as extremely dangerous and and um and what we're seeing through these incidents is that there are people with\nDeeply bigoted views are who are having their ideas reinforced on line or reinforced in the public sphere and um are feeling emboldened to act um [noise] you know I I I think\nYou know I don't think we're at an epidemic level amazing these incidents happened together and they're drawing attention to them but I think it's very worrisome and very scary um and and it should be a real wakeup call I don't you know to to answer your question I think that um [noise]\nYeah I don't think there's a clear reason why we're in this position and why terrorism has become more common parlance certainly after nine eleven and the United states I think\nI think it that that particular incident drew a lot of attention in the United states to terrorism but if you were to go around the world whether it be Israel or whether it be ah the United kingdom or other places too long ago that uh there are longer histories of terrorism where these ideas and these concepts for one more present than in the United states\nIt seems like both cities are a second I'm Robert Bowers were influenced by ideas they got on an online communities should we be concerned\nThat kind of speech and is that even something we could consider\n[noise] I think I think we should be concerned about it for sure and I think one of the things that that seems true about the the these social networks is that they tend to increase polarization they tend to reinforce views\nThey allow people to uh I think to to develop extreme ideas and and feel as if they are validated in those ideas by finding other people on line [noise]\nUm [noise] the question of how you control them is a really difficult one I think you're seeing some of the larger social media companies like Facebook and Twitter who are\nGetting more I'd say aggressive in the way in which they are trying to clamp down on hate speech or a speech that or postings that would um\nInside violence or that are deliberately false information at the same time I think you have to be really careful about you know you don't want these companies to be the grand arbiters of speech and the United states which is a very long history of of supporting\nA free and open dialogue and speech um and I think they're in a tough spot um [noise] I think that the reason why a term like terrorism I think can be helpful in this context is that I think it it it points to the seriousness\nOf the issue and I think that it would I think\nA prompt more resources and attention to the kind of hateful and violent rhetoric that's happening in some of that dark corners of the Web and and again I think they should you know these incidents should really should be a wakeup call for all of us
