[noise]\nThis election season Wisconsin Public radio is meeting people where they are in their communities to talk about the issues that matter most to them as part of our ongoing conversations about the beyond the ballot project we look at how Wisconsin I answer affected by political division\nHave you seen political polarization affect your community how has your vote changed over time did you used to vote split ticket but don't anymore\nIs political division the most or one of the most important issues this election season\nAnd why or why not eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas at WNPR dot org is our email address and you can tweet us at WNPR mornings\nJonah Ralston is an assistant professor of political science at U. W. whitewater and he's the coordinator of the universities public policy and administration program and Jonah thank you for joining us this morning\nAnd thank you for having with\nAnd we welcome Bridget Belden to the program Brigitte ... is a special project reporter at Wisconsin Public radio and project manager of beyond the ballot rigid good morning morning\nSo Bridget your here with us today to offer an update on beyond the ballot WNPR news election year project will lead to Tim render sin kick us off\nSaid ... he has something to say that we hear a lot and seek out around interviewing people\nCountries very divided and\nNeeds my input\nBridget how often does this issue political division come up in conversations with Wisconsin I it's\nIt's one of the top issue is we are asking very vague question things like why is the most important issue to you this election season people bring up the political division I lie it's something that people are concerned about\nJoan I Want to hear from you hear a how has division of uh how has division changed over time\nYeah well I think what people are feeling is that actually borne out by the sound that while a so that particularly since the nineties there's been\nSo if we can get people that can get people across the aisle to work with them they would be great\nA Jonah in a world of increase political polarization how our discussions of bipartisanship playing out\nYeah I think it becomes increasingly difficult for politicians because uh you know they they do get punished at the polls for these kinds of things these days so it's interesting you say this phenomenon where people expressed a desire for\nBut then if these politicians don't vote for that particular way that they want a you know late and they end up compromising you know they can actually get punished pretty severely for that um so you see a lot of um talk of wanting this but I'm not sure that the politicians sense that there'll be rewarded for\nLet's take a phone call Lisa joins us from last saw this morning Lisa welcome to the morning show\nGood morning I'm what were they had called about was um a couple of things that that same kind of menial to me but I think it would be very important and why is it just a feeding of Congress they divide it to the Democrat side and the Republican side\nIf they were on the that said that they were sitting next to each other and then going and talking maybe something as simple as that could help\n'em also and media um it seems like the more that's repeated seems like the more that we know and it it's a always repeated about how divided it is and um [noise]\nThe uh I I Know there's there's got to be a tricky balance there because you're wanting to report it would be nice if there was more focused on where they are working together because that's more of what we as the public with no then\nOkay Lisa thanks for that let's go to Jeremy quickly and re scene and then our desk and respond Jeremy uh go ahead\nI recall I think the political divided troops Judy ... three things ah that I've noticed over the last eight years or so one or a lot of the narrative is that by politicians that we elect\nThey set the tone that narrative ... and people become a constrictors come to echo chambers of the politicians they're trying to do their best to create a narrative that get their agenda passed and often times\nThey begin to\nBelieve everything you think back in his social media I think social media is playing a really big role in people's decision on on how they go to the polls and and what their political views are and values and thirdly I noticed a lot of people are not taking time out to see actually fact check our politicians\nGet informed before you make a decision it just seems that it's too easy to jump on your Facebook read a few pose that are\nSent by third party media giants a politician setting up their narrative and that's it they don't start searching lab looking at with ... with media or or the facts are or anything they're just they're not taking the time out to inform themselves on on what is really going on you\nOkay Jeremy thanks I Want to get ... response to those are two uh two of our listeners concerned about the role that the media and particularly social media or play here ah what do you think about Jonah\nYeah I think we have to point to the changing media landscape as part of this a\nParticularly when you think about the days of Walter Cronkite and you know everybody was watching the same kind of news source of the same dealing with the same kind of facts and then when you go to have a conversation with somebody you're you're dealing with are the same information of course we know now that many people are silo ing off than they were just hearing\nThe news that speaks to what do they want to see or hear and so that of course changes the nature of our discussions with one another when we're dealing with different sources of information particularly when those sorts of it of information or just confirming our pre existing beliefs\nOf bridges to some people bring a President Trump up as part of this conversation what are we hearing\nA lot of people actually bring up the president um when they're talking about this topic and I should mention that there are people who voted for him on and people who didn't tell him don't for him I'm sincere loving you'd have ... um she's from Milwaukee and he said she has to say\nHe's a divider and he's you know he he speaks a vision he doesn't speak up a combination gather Everytime you him Tweedy talking on a ... device is never about nothing about unity saying as good\nOr is always oh we have these people I hate the people all these people make me sick and he should be like that because that's causing division\nJonah President Trump inside are we seeing similar feelings about division on the national level\nUh yeah I think we are and and I do think that sometimes the device of leaders are can be a consequence of political polarization rather than a cause or both\nOr and in this case right I don't think you have a um you know the the leaders in Congress and the and the current president well you know that do seem to be um\nMore accepting of division I don't think you're going to have that unless you already have the division presence right or they may contribute to it but again it does seem like they're more ah a consequence of it\nLet's take another call this time we'll go to ... go and Troy is with us ... good morning for\nUm I think the number one and I I think this is tied in with the civil war picked and then what it comes down to is definitely feel bad um big money corporations are\nDirect link to our politicians and because of that we have a system that only caters to people with a lot of money and if that really feels like that um I think we have especially in Wisconsin\nWe have currently even with our president we have a lead it and we have people that are an office that are strictly working for big corporations and there's this fight class\nAll that and you look out workers or you're a worker and you're trying to trying to be empowered as a worker and it's really difficult to do that so I think that if I\nTry to thanks a lot for the general Alston\nA well I think there's certainly some truth to what do you have to say in regard to the influence of money also contributing to this or we know that there's a strong correlation between income inequality and political polarization so that as we become more divided by socioeconomic status and income\nAnd wealth that we also become more politically divided and to this point of you know the average voter feeling that their view is represented\nUm there's actually a pretty good opinion poll that has been asked I'm\nFrom Nineteen Ninety six foot two thousand ten in Nineteen Ninety six when asked how much they do you have and what the government does about half of people said not much which you know is concerning on its own right but when you get to two thousand him that number rises to more than two thirds Seventy percent and\nI imagine if you took it now it might even be higher than that\nRigid let's turn to what it means for future generations something Pam clay ... raised during her beyond about a conversation Bridget tell us more\n... than she is really concerned about political division and I'm like\nHow we build the world for our children where they can grow up strong independent and financially stable\nI think it's increasingly difficult\nTo have a conversation about their future generation because there's so much debate in the\nMedia and and the political climate\nJonah give us an idea given with the data shows that it's just political division going to get better or worse\nOh gosh well we certainly have to make a prediction these days after a little bit of a gun are facing twenty sixteen for most of 'em\nBut I Will say that the trends are concerning right they're not\nMoving in the direction of suggesting that there's going to be left that there's a kind of the near future um and I certainly young people are worried about a number of things one being that you know it does look like that they may be financially worse off than their parents and that's not happened in some uh decades since that's been the case\nOf Bridget for those who want to share their thoughts about political polarization or just to get involved in beyond the bounds of what can they do\nThey can go to our website fats WPRI dot org slash ballet and there's a forum there they could sell out we are trying to get to a five hundred interviews by the election so we would love that if people would be to ask\nTo participate we want to hear what you have to say and give the website one more time to WPRI dot org slash talent\nAlright rigid Bowden a reporter for Wisconsin Public radio news and project manager of beyond the ballot or John Ralston is an assistant professor of political science at U. W. water tank you both for joining us this morning\nThank you thank you for everything\nComing up next what is the role of celebrity endorsements in today's politics we'll explore that coming up next and we want to hear from you do you care of celebrity endorses a political candidate or makes a political statement\nDoes it affect your opinion or even perhaps how you vote eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six more two one two three four ideas of WNPR dot org or tweet us at WNPR mornings I'm John months and it's the morning show on the ideas network\nI'm supporting transgender individuals right to use the bathroom of their choice that's where you see an equal number of Americans saying it's appropriate for celebrities to speak out on this on as the an equal number saying that it's inappropriate\nIt's also were seen similar numbers for support and criticism of President Trump steps of some of the most divisive issue says\nCelebrities for the most part should stay away from mentioning Trump than in any of that rhetoric\nA camera and easily under ... are of morning console are our guests this hour we're talking about celebrity endorsements and whether they manner or do you care about celebrity endorsements eight hundred six four to one two three four let's turn to a caller now rose joins us from rice lake\nHi rose Hi Hi go ahead\nHi I Do like the idea of celebrities giving their opinion because with social media that's out there and how much it gets used by\nCelebrities followers and I'm a younger generation I think it's had the tend to vote or doesn't keep up on stuff\nLike that but if they have a celebrity that they admire and they respect their opinions and talk I think that it helps them get the confidence to Google votes where they normally might not\nSo I I think that's okay\nAll right ... thanks for sharing the perspective of joining a before roses call you mentioned avoiding mention of President Trump but some are working with him like he was um let's go to Nate in Milwaukee next\nNate good morning things are joining us on the morning show\nThe morning and thank you I was actually going to mention the con you uh uh I don't usually pay attention to celebrity endorsements but I think people who follow them are like ...\nOut there and pull 'em and sometimes I Do listen because now you're on the stump saying by what they say when their doors I saw Kanye West was interesting er ... earlier last week when he said the Foxconn would bring four thousand jobs\nAnd that struck me because Thirteen thousand has been promised so maybe it was reviewing and the way it's kind of with your traditional ah Scott Walker where he promises one thing in science happens\nLike All right ... thanks for the prospective we had a ... and rose rose saying yeah it's a celebrity endorsements are okay I Need to pointing out that does sometimes of celebrities are wrong and a camera in the ... what do you care to comment on our last two callers here\nSo I'm Rick ... regarding Kanye West we actually we tested the value of his endorsements earlier this year I'm back back at the very beginning of the year before any of this uh you know a Trump connection drag it energy storyline got going\nI'm and basically what we found is that he was pretty toxic among Republicans and independents are independents said they were twenty nine points less likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Kanye West\nRepublicans were forty seven points less\nLikely to vote for a candidate I was endorsed by Kanye West and you didn't get any kind of of up tech really significant uptick among Democrats\nI'm now obviously I Would I Would think that those numbers have have changed a little bit um after after that the past few news cycles um between between Trump and con yet\nBut I think this is probably a good example of an endorsement that that really isn't that helpful um you know if you if you look at at the way the president performed with black voters and two thousand sixteen it wasn't good um we have seen\nA con you have comments provoke or provoke a backlash from you know the uh the African American I'm Talking heads and that and commentary it\nAnd as well as the backlash on on social media so it it kind of seems like a that wasn't a whole lot for for the ... the president to gain their\nCamera in last week Taylor's would came out in favor of to Tennessee Democrats in urge people to vote in a long Instagram post after that over a hundred and fifty thousand people registered on vote dont Oregon a three day period that said those numbers cannot be directly attributed to Taylor Swift as they weren't tractors specified but what struck you your camera\n[noise] well I think it's pretty interesting because Taylor Swift has been very love to to enter the fray and when that when it when it comes to political issues um she's been pretty meticulous and ah and and keeping her her image a in a way that she can you know promote to appeal to\nTo all kinds of Americans in and help sell records [noise]\nUm I Do think from a political perspective um vis\nVis Taylor Swift endorsement could have something of a of a boomerang effect\nAnd end up uh harming democratic chances in the state I think I think Phil Bredesen or you know as a former governor Democrat I'm In the state kind of wanted to\nBasically wants to wants to run an under the radar campaign all the way through election day or his opponent a congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is not particularly popular in the state even among Republican voters and I think anything that is going to nationalize the race\nOr give Republicans a talking point like you know she's Phil Bredesen is in league with with Hollywood\nThat could that could end up being more damaging to his cat as the\n... and a Joanna the way people feel about celebrities getting political is similar to how they think about brands and companies getting political I'll give you the last word just quickly explained that [noise]\nWell I think more more more celebrities come forward and get their hands you know where we are politically or ... or doing the same day in fact our friends and a lot of ways to see like people want to have\nStances on same sex marriage you want to take a stance on climate change et cetera so more and more we want is public figures to be like people to have a shift like we\nWere talking about whether or not celebrity endorsements matter and our conversation will continue or what do you think about this issue a eight hundred six

think that's a very positive because up until now those children were often I'm\nReally a unnecessarily submitted to all sorts of uh operations to force them into one category of the other and the adults\nWho have a ... effect social movement now are showing very clearly that that that has very negative\nConsequences it often includes loss of any kind of feeling and when genital region which you know not many of us would would want to force it upon a child so I think that's a that's a really that the category that it makes perfect sense for it also makes sense\nFor um people mostly young people use this new language of being non binary and not feeling as if they are women or men and so a category ... feels right to that some of them\nUm that's a harder that's an interesting category and why or why I think that this is the beginning and not the end solution is for these people it's not clear that\nSex engender are necessarily to say a synonym than that is\nIt is it acts about one sex or is it about one's gender for interest acts people particularly bathe and it's really about sex\nOr non binary people it's really about gender ... binary people\nAlso have no fat but in my next\nBook that I'm writing and interviewing non binary people and I find all different answers some believe that they are male or female their gender is Jeff and binary and others also rejected that category sell up\nSome of those people will want adequate but others will not\nAnd so they'll all of those\nDifferent kinds of people are in some sense is a dumb together in one category\nHow much should promote you seen a ... is there a lot of demand for this third option\n\nIt's a great question we had no research on this yeah there's been absolutely no and uh for for good reason it very hard to do a representative ... and get a big enough and and it was enough people to know but we really had no idea\nHow popular this option going to be I think in every case when the larger change their change based on arguments from social movements\nBut we're going to have to wait and see how popular an option it actually is in my research I find that\nWhile some transgender respondents in my book might choose a category act others are perfectly happy to choose a male or female they just want to be free to choose which of those categories of reflects who they are\nSo we talked about Minnesota and a driver's licenses is one of those New York city and birth certificates where else have we seen changes made\nWith actually think changes made or being made on the entire west coast ah Washington state Oregon and California are we've also seen changes made in other countries and so did his clearly I think it is a trend in the future\nI don't think oh we'll know until we see the demand for it and the kinds of people with what kinds of identities who's you that the law to have gone into effect in very different ways and many state\nLaws only adults who are looking back and change that birth certificate in New York City they're allowing parents use this on babies versus ... that those are two very different ways for what\nWe'll we'll continue our discussion and just a moment of Barbara's Mendoza distinguished professor of sociology at the University of Chicago what do you think about adding a third gender option to birth certificate or driver's licenses eight hundred six more two one two three four it's the ideas network and the morning show I'm Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nOption is foolish so not not everybody is on the same page here as as you pointed out bar\nBut I Would like to point out that that farmers only these two categories is seen to accept that farmer has absolutely\nWe don't have the fabled on gender and animals that have consciousness because gender identity it has to do it uh uh ability to have selfish selective identities and that is quite different\nFrom farm animals and so I that I think it's a great illustration of why we have to be\nCareful when we talk about\nThese issues to see whether or not we're asking for sex\nOr gender I'm ... I Will get on a plane later today to go to Australia to do some making a gigs and I will be asked to check my gender and then it will be male female I don't really think\nThe TSA hairs weather on very feminine or math skills which is really about my gender but they really care about is like that so that for the um\nWhen I go through security they know you know whether or not I'm hiding a gun in some part of my body and no I think\nIt's I think I mean every time I asked my gender because\nUh like everyone else lied young I my gender suffocated I'm not particularly I'm definitely female and I love woman but I'm not very ...

where they are in their communities to talk about the issues that matter most to them as part of our ongoing conversations about the beyond the ballot project we look at how Wisconsin nights are affected by political division [noise]\nHave you seen political polarization affect your community how has your vote changed over time did you used to vote split ticket but don't anymore\nIs political division the most or one of the most important issues this election season\nAnd why or why not eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four ideas that WPRI dot org is our email address and you can tweet us at WNPR mornings\nJonah roll student is an assistant professor of political science at U. W. whitewater and he's the coordinator of the universities public policy and administration program and Jonah thank you for joining us this morning\nAnd thank you for having with\nAnd we welcome Bridget Belden to the program Brigitte ... is a special project reporter at Wisconsin Public radio and project manager of beyond the ballot rigid good morning had morning\nBridget your here with us today to offer an update on the on the ballot WNPR news election year project will lead to Tim renders and kick us off\nSaid came in from Manitowoc and he has something to say that we hear a lot as he go around interviewing people\nCountries very divided and [noise]\nAnd he's my input Bridget\nHow often does this issue political division come up in conversations with Wisconsin I\nIt's one of the top issue is we are asking very vague question things like why is the most important issue to you this election season people bring up the political division I lie it's something that people are concerned about [noise]\nI don't want to hear from you hear a how has division of uh how has division changed over time\n[noise] yeah well I think what people are feeling is actually borne out by the other well ah so that particularly in the nineties there\nJonah in a world of increase political polarization how our discussions of bipartisanship playing out\nYeah I think it becomes increasingly difficult for politicians because uh you know they they do get punished at the polls for these kinds of things these days so it's interesting you say this phenomenon where people expressed a desire for\nBut then if these politicians don't vote for that particular way that they want a you know late and they end up compromise they you know they can actually get punished pretty severely for that um so you see a lot of um talk of wanting this but I'm not sure that the politicians sense that there'll be rewarded for\nLet's take a phone call Lisa joins us from Warsaw this morning Lisa welcome to the morning show\nTheir morning um what what I had called about was um a couple of things that that same kind of meaningful to me but I think it would be very important one is just a feeding of Congress they divide it to the Democrat side and the Republican side\nIf they were on the that said that they were sitting next to each other and mainland talking maybe something as simple as that could help\n'em also media um it seems like the more that's repeated seems like the more that we know and it it's a always repeated about how divided it is and um [noise]\nThe the I I Know there's there's got to be a tricky balance there 'cause you're wanting to report it would be nice if there was more focused on where they are working\nMore of what we as the public with no then\nOkay Lisa thanks for that let's go to Jeremy quickly and re scene and then our guests can respond Jeremy uh go ahead\nHi thanks for my call I think the political divided spruce Judy ... three things ah that I've noticed over the last eight years or so want a a lot of the narrative is that by politicians that we elect\nA they set the tone that narrative and people become a ... to come to echo chambers of the politicians they're trying to do their best to create a narrative that get their agenda passed and oftentimes\nPeople are misled believe everything you face all they begin to believe everything you think back in his social media\nI think social media as being a really big role in people's decision on on how they go to the polls and and what their political views are and values and thirdly\nI noticed a lot of people are not taking time out to we actually fact check our politicians get\nInformed before you make a decision it just seems that it's too easy to jump on your Facebook read a few pause that are sent by third party media giants a politician setting up their narrative and that's it they don't\nStart searching the Web looking at with ... with media or political factor or anything they're just they're not taking the time out to inform themselves on on what is really going on and\nOK Germany thanks I Want to get ... response to this are two uh two of our listeners concerned about the role that the media and particularly social media play here oh what do you think of ...\nYeah I think we have to point to the changing media landscape as part of this a\nParticularly when you think about the days of Walter Cronkite and you know everybody was watching the same kind of news source of the same dealing with the same kind of facts\nAnd then when you go to have a conversation with somebody you're you're dealing with are the same information of course we know now that many people are silo ing off than they were just hearing\nThe news that speaks to what do they want to see or hear and so that of course changes the nature of our discussions with one another when we're dealing with different sources of information particularly when those sorts of it of information or just confirming our pre existing beliefs\nOr Bridgette to some people bring a President Trump up as part of this conversation what are we hearing\nNow a lot of people actually bring up the president um when they're talking about this topic and I should mention that there are people who voted for him on and people who didn't tell him tell for him I'm sincere loving you'd have ... she's found Milwaukee ... he was that she has to him\nHe's a divider and he's you know he he speaks the vision he doesn't speak up a combination gather Everytime here I Am tweeting talking about the vice\nIs never about nothing about unity saying ask good or is always oh we have these people have these people all these people make mistakes and he can't be like that because that's causing division\nA Jonah President Trump inside are we seeing similar feelings about division on the national level\nUh yeah I think we are and and I do think that sometimes a divisive leaders are can be a consequence of political polarization rather than a cause or both\nOr and in this case right I don't think you have a um you know the the leaders in Congress and the and the current president\nWell you know that they seem to be um more accepting of division I don't think you're going to have that unless you already have the division presence right or they may contribute to it but again it does seem like they're more um\nA consequence of\nLet's take another call this time we'll go to\nGood morning for and um I think the number one and I\nI think this is tied in with the civil war that number one thing that comes down to is definitely feel bad um big money and corporations are direct link to our politicians and because of that we have a system that only caters to people with a lot of money\nAnd it definitely feels like that um I think we have\nHere in Wisconsin we have currently even with our president we have a lead it and we have people that are an op ed that are strictly working for big corporations and there's just a fight class where you either you're either pro business and you look down on workers or\nYou're a worker and you're trying to trying to be empowered as a worker and it's really difficult to do that so I think that prior to fight it comes up\nDry and thanks for the general Alston\nA well I think there's certainly some truth to what do you have to say in regard to the influence of money also contributing to this uh we know that there's a strong correlation between income inequality and political polarization so that as we become more divided by socioeconomic status and income and wealth\nBut we also become more politically divided and to this point of you know the average voter feeling that their view is represented um there's actually a pretty good opinion poll that has been asked I'm from Nineteen Ninety six to two thousand and ten and in Nineteen Ninety six\nAsked how much said you have and what the government does about half of people said not much which you know is concerning on its own right but when you get to two thousand him that number rises to more than two thirds Seventy percent and I imagine if you took it now it might even be higher than that\nRigid let's turn to what it means for future generations something Pam clay ... raised during her beyond about a conversation Bridget tell us more\nPanic Madison and she is really concerned about political division and I'm just like\nWe build the world for our children where they can grow up strong independent and\nFinancially stable [noise]\nI think it's increasingly difficult\nGood conversations about their future generation because there's so much debate in the\nMedia and and the political climate\nJonah give us an idea of giving with the data shows is just political division going to get better or worse\nOh gosh well we certainly have to make a prediction these days after a little bit of a gun are facing twenty six team for most of 'em but I Will say\nThat the trends are concerning right they're not moving in the direction of suggesting that there's going to be less position a time in the near future um and I certainly young people are worried about a number of things one being that you know it does look like that they may be financially worse off\nThan their parents and that's not happening in some a decade since that's been the case [noise]\nAbridged for those who want to share their thoughts about political polarization or just get involved and beyond about what can they do\nThey can go to our website fats WPRI dot org

also were seen similar numbers for support and criticism of President Trump sets of some of the most divisive issues of celebrities for the most part should stay away from mentioning Trump than in any of that rhetoric\nA camera and easily under joined gyms or our morning console are our guests this hour we're talking about celebrity endorsements and whether they matter do you care about celebrity endorsements eight hundred six word two one two three four let's turn to a caller now rose joins us from rice lake\nHi rose Hi Hi go ahead\nI Do like the idea of celebrities giving their opinion because with social media that's out there and how much it gets used by\nCelebrities followers and um the younger generation I think it's had the tend to vote or doesn't keep up on stuff like that but if they have a celebrity that they had my ear and they respect their opinions and\nThink that it helps them get the confidence to Google votes where they normally might not so I I think that's okay\nAll right ... thanks for sharing that uh that perspective ... joined up before roses call you mentioned avoiding mentioned President Trump but some are working with him like Kanye West um let's go to Nate in Milwaukee next Nate good morning thanks for joining us on the morning show\nThe morning and thank you I was actually going to mention the Kanye West uh I\nDon't usually pay attention to celebrity endorsements but I think people who follow them or like the previous callers I might be powered to get out there and pull 'em and sometimes I Do is and because I'll be informed about some saying by what\nThey say when they endorse I sought Kanye West was interesting a URL\nEarlier last week when he said that Foxconn would bring four thousand jobs\nAnd that struck me because Thirteen thousand has been promised so maybe it was reviewing and the way it's kind of what is your tradition of ah Scott Walker where he promises one thing and something else happens\nLike All right ... thanks for the perspective we had a ... and rose rose saying yeah you should do celebrity endorsements are okay a need to pointing out that does sometimes of celebrities are wrong and a camera no what do you care to comment on our last two callers here\nSo I'm Rick ... regarding Kanye West we actually we tested the value of his endorsement earlier this year I'm back back at the very beginning of the year before any of this uh you know a Trump connection dragging energy storyline got going I'm\nAnd basically what we found is that he was pretty toxic among Republicans and independents\nA independence that they were twenty nine points less likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Kanye West Republicans were forty seven points less likely to vote for a candidate was endorsed by Kanye West and you didn't get any kind of of up tech\nReally significant uptick among Democrats I'm now obviously I Would think that those numbers have have changed a little bit um after after that the past few news cycles um between between Trump and con yet but I think that's probably a good example\nOf an endorsement that that really isn't that helpful um you know if you if you look at at the way the president performed with black voters and two thousand sixteen it wasn't good or we have seen a con you have comments provoke or provoke a backlash\nFrom you know the uh the African American I'm Talking heads and that and ... and as well as a backlash on social media so it it kind of seems like ah that wasn't a whole lot for for the the president to gain their\nCamera in last week Taylor Swift came out in favor of two tendency Democrats in urge people to vote in a long Instagram post after that over a hundred and fifty thousand people registered on vote dot org and a three day period that said those numbers cannot be directly attributed to Taylor Swift as they weren't tractors specified but what struck you hear Kamron\nWell I think it's pretty interesting because\nTaylor Swift has been very love\nTo to enter the fray when it when it when it comes to political issues um she's been pretty meticulous and ah and and keeping her her image a in a way that she can you know promote to appeal to to all kinds of Americans and and now to sell records\nUm I Do think from a political perspective um this\nHave something of a of a boomerang effect and end up uh harming democratic chances in the state I think I think Phil Bredesen or you know as a former governor\nDemocrat um an estate kind of wanted to\nBasically wants to wants to run an under the radar campaign all the way through election day as opposed to a\nCongresswoman Marsha Blackburn is not particularly popular in the state even among Republican voters and like anything that is going to nationalize the race give Republicans a talking point like\nYou know she's still brought us in league with with Hollywood liberal like Taylor Swift I think that that could that could end up being more damaging to his cat as the on the whole\n... and a Joanna the way people feel about celebrities getting political is similar to how they think about brands and companies getting political I'll give you the last word just quickly explained that [noise]\nWell I think the war more and more celebrities come forward and give their opinions where we are politically ... brand they are doing the same day in and we expect our friends and a lot of ways to see like people we want to have\nStances on same sex marriage you want to you know take a stance on climate change et cetera so more and more we want these public figures
