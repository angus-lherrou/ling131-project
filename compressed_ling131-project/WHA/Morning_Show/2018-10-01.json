I'm coming from another province\nThat was nowhere in the tour book for the great wall so I spent all this time and energy getting to the great wall only to find there was an easier and um you know more accessible way up to the great wall\nWell um it looks like children start noticing kind of race or at least paying attention to racial teaches at thirty is three or four months uh you know that they've gotten looking more at the faces that they've seen in their environment they kick it is so it's something that they stop noticing\nReally early and they got kind of phony theories about particularly if we don't talk to them about it\nSo what what factors go into helping children form their understanding [noise]\nWell I think um parents talking to them about it uh using books than television as ways of kind of showing that um different types of people that are\nThat we can sort of watching it in my hair and enjoy a kind of images of different groups and being willing to kind of label and discussed and on\nAnd certainly plenty of research that suggests that African American and Hispanic and I'm an Asian American families do that I'm white families are often have somewhat less comes at doing that\nAnd why why is that we know\nOh I think it comes from pretty good intentions on as well as some kind of level of this comes it you know that is I mean it makes perfect sense why if a African American families ah do talk about it because they want to kind of a show that kids that they matched\nThat you know and we know that the African American kids thin and Hispanic or Asian American kids notice that there are fewer representations and they can they wanted the cat doesn't contend\nThat catches than in some way on whereas white parents I think often they worry that they're going to make their case racist actually if they kind of name all pointed out\nA cactus all wrong to different races or ethnicities and some might come from a good place but it's not necessarily a great thing\nWhat evidence is there the children connect the positive or negative representations of gender and race to their understanding of themselves [noise]\nWell I'm a couple of things I mean I think what is that I'm a ... minority kids well well so to speak about wanting to see the pictures of themselves all feeling sad and do this hot and\nPatients and I think on the other hand um and I and I think general stereotypes play play roles to write that I'm at the sections of what's appropriate for a boy to do or go to do on can be pretty powerful on the daily when kids go\nTo it's kind of phase of really kind of cutting out the boundaries of boys ... and which is like around\nThree to five something pretty potent at that divide us so\nI think you know mad as its representations in that it varied representations so that kids can kind of connect to cross the kind of multiple dimensions so if I can point Dora came out a win Latino kids are watching and reset just like how how do you feel to Dora\nAt the the the Latino voice and I well no I mean yes she's Latino Boise and she'd go and I want someone to me you know and so it's a complicated but important kind of area\nWilling and when it comes to gender I mean oftentimes it you know that ah the imaging there starts a practically from birth the girls good to have a lot of pain can in in their room and boys blue I mean those are just cultural traditions at least in western culture ah so\n... and it's like these are just cultural norms are accepted\nUh how do we uh how do we deal with some of that\n[noise] well I think by by kind of allowing kids to kind of grace freely by offering then some alternatives and by kind of noticing when we make assumptions so stay then\nTo what I mean for example when I Would play with my kids and all that taught it I Would notice\nSometimes that boys young boys where like attracted to Bobby in a way it wouldn't be attracted to body she's like incredibly ... the you know that the parents sometimes in pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this little boy wanted to know glitzy Bobby I'm\nThinking about why we're uncomfortable about that and kind of you know whether it would in fact be fine or just as problematic for a boy that had\nBody as it would be for gold have body I think it's kind of useful to reflect on what thinking\nWell let's be honest I mean the assumption there is a boys want to play with Barbie that must mean they're gay\nYeah might well be that kind of fear and thinking that well really I really think that if a boy's gonna play with Bobby that's got to somehow making gay and second kind of what would you know why would I be concerned if my kid is gay it's not like you know the I think\nYeah I think thinking through and and kind of reflecting on that if people\nThere are a lot of land mines out there where we're talking about whether diverse representation in children's literature and media impacts their perceptions of gender and race later on this hour we'll talk about\nHow public libraries and schools are addressing this issue my guest is Louise tomorrow's professor communication arts that you W Madison\nAnd she studies how children interpret and respond to media content\nWhat's what children's book or children's book character has affected your life why and parents how do you talk to your children about gender and race we'd like to hear from you this morning what your story eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four\nIdeas WPRI dot org or you can tweet us at W. P. R. mornings\nSo all of these the representations a a negative or positive of various uh gender or\nThat has to have some sort of impact on the self esteem of children talk a little bit about what do what is that impact and and how does that manifest itself\nNeeded a pot of a notch a kind of set of messages about ... on and kind of what's possible and I think it's been important that old parents had kind of content that they can use to show that kid\nYou not to your important ... come from here a kind of people hit your history he's what you can eat and to kind of has\nA book and paintings and TV content that they can use 'em to support that knit plenty of research that suggests that parents having\nThat kind of kind of conversations with their kid helps kids feel better about themselves feel supported and kinda move it salient when they do in fact face kind of prejudice in society\nActress Viola Davis loved the book corduroy because she felt represented by the character who was a black girl she still remembers that book go all the all these years later and it was so important that she wrote a sequel so this seems like an example of how media representation can stick with us well beyond childhood\nHow far reaching are the lessons we learned from media\nOh I think they can be tremendously important I think that a single ... to say I'm can kinda last forever and one's head in any kind of be someone that I felt like a friend fees uh who authored kind of hope\nAbout what was possible um and so I think that that can\nBe really strong and powerful connections and I think and we have to give kids some options right conscious the that one ... to have to take kind of all the possibilities for all the kids out there because\nIt within a given racial or gender group there are lots of kids with different experiences so we need yeah lots of options for kids to have hope\nCan it can you give us some examples of children's TV shows are books that are good examples of how diversity can be best addressed with children\nI think for example\nIt's great that we had ... stuffing too is you know young African American ...\nTo kind of threw me rather than just kind of a minus site kick I think it was great that there was kind of on for a while I'm as Chinese American but I think one thing that's interesting about these things is while\nThey should can be kind of obvious and transparent states to minority kids so white kids\nThe kids who I'm into that that group sometimes they're not necessarily it's clear and kids need adults to kind of point tapped connections like oh no doors speak Spanish like showy and your class you know get it\n... ... ...\nUh Louise Louise ... is a professor of communication arts at W. Madison she studies how children interpret and respond to media content we're talking about\nWhether diverse representation in children's literature immediate impacts their perceptions of gender and race later on in the hour we'll also explore how public libraries and schools are addressing this issue I'm John ... and this is the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio\nAbsolutely they're ready to uh you know in fact did some research suggesting that kind of what parents say a particularly the pre\nSchool age kids even somewhat less important than kind of that body language the kind of wall with which um adults a scene interacting across racial and ethnic lines and so kind of the best predictor of kits a kind of racial attitudes or whether the law\nHas friends of different races and ethnicities so we are sending messages to our kids are old and kind of need to think a little bit about what those messages are 'cause the absence of us kind of explicit modeling or explicit conversations is actually a pretty powerful message\nSo that the whole thing and just become sort of a taboo\nYeah absolutely and I think that's kind of sad and dangerous\nWe're talking about how diverse representation in children's literature and media impact children's perception of gender and race\nWas we use him are as a professor of communication are said you don't you Madison she studies how children interpret and respond to media content we'd like to respond to our media content to joining our conversation here at eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four\nSo how does race and uh do race and gender needs to be frankly discussed with children or is it possible for them to form an understanding by the mere presence of diversity so let's say that a mom and dad have a\nA diverse group of friends and they are are they are around people of different ethnicities and maybe even different gender roles\nOr if we don't talk to them about it specifically can just our behavior or make the complete picture here\nI think I'll be heavier has a huge impact yeah and I think parents having a diverse group of friends\nKids are seeing though it's warm and friendly interactions is probably going to be the most powerful I think there is um but I think\nIn the absence of that because you know not everyone has diverse groups of friends or to complement that um I think using media but then using media mindfully and being willing to talk about it can be also really useful but assuming that kids will somehow\nJust be able to know that this character is meant to connect in these ways to the kids I see at school or in preschool\nThat I think it's a mistake I think for example TV to pitch and they're often animated and those set of images that animated images\nAre clear to us but not necessarily clear to children\nHow does a diversity children's authors and TV show producers or writers have an impact on the content that we see\nAll I think that's clearly tremendously important questions of authenticity and and even just thinking about kind of the particular parties and what I mean like a peculiarity that's kind of getting the details right so when Viola Davis talks about a caring about Lisa the character and ... I mean\nWhat matters right is that a\nDisco is dressed in and look send behaves in mystery sort of know beautiful identifiable way and and\nThe getting the details right um so that a kid can identify with that person I think it's tremendously important\nMore troops do you have a four parents for having the kinds of Frank conversations were suggesting a with their children\nTo thinking about\nI'm kind of sitting down making pot of your evening routine or whatever right having that an array of books that you you have the kids pick out from the library or whatever all sitting and watching the TV shows and saying just occasionally asking questions like where do you think you know I'm\nA ... you know who is she liking your clients you know do do you notice that stops African American like your friends there it is you know and and the will to use the language I think and think comfortable about it I think he's really helpful\nWomen of color who wants to join us let's hear from Liz who's calling us in so from southeastern Wisconsin Lewis thanks for joining us on a morning show\nGood morning thank you for a whole and call\n'em I can listen to the program and I did\nThe reverse of what's being discussed is happening at my child's school I'm ... and she goes to a very small school in a very small community um and I\nAnd they purposely take her out there but every races represented at this at the school where there's a total from kindergarten to eighth grade fifty students\nAll of the kids stay together of all age groups and I had commented to my best friend last year how will we explain to the kids when they get out of the school that this scenario is not how it's going to be in all places in the great big world\nAnd our English\nTeacher um this you're on a signed for the seventh and eighth grade as a book called world of thunder or my cry and so that kind of got some of the kids thinking that wall why is this happening there and that has led to the discussion of you're\nIn different colors might not always be running on this\nGive our guest a chance to respond Louis\nI I think eight I think it's great your kid is going to touch it at the school I think I Love that you bring up that book head off a kind of a chance had insight into the prejudice and kind of had\nKind of is that carries experience what that feels like to recognize that it's not a friendship that era really negative experience without fail at my like\nLouis Mars thank you so much for spending this this time with this this morning I really appreciate it matches eight Louis Mars is a professor of communication arts at U.

local reporters check in with Governor Walker over the weekend I he was a Packer game on Sunday and so W ELL UK TV in Green Bay asked governor hey it looks like this deadline is going to pass\nWhat's

the next step is so things seem pretty yeah flexible\nOr to make a welcome to the morning show thanks for joining us this morning\nThanks good to be with you\nThe on Saturday the FBI began its first full day of work on an additional background investigation of a judge Brett Kavanaugh how does this kind of investigation compared to past processes of Supreme Court nominees is this unique\nWell in terms of a a background check that part of it of course isn't unique and in fact Kavanaugh I'd gone through one not only for his nomination to the Supreme Court but as was often mentioned during the hearings five previous one for various positions that he held including\nHis current on as a judge on the court of appeals are but this particular sort of supplementary investigation or is rare but obviously is not unique again during the hearings for the Democrats in particular often mentioned how during the Clarence Thomas hearings when they needed ills\nUm accusations were made public that\nWe learned that there had been a supplemental FBI investigation although at the time it was a confidential and we learn about it until a little bit later but still it was a situation where the uh background investigation had been reopened for\nSupplemental information or to be gathered\nHow does the timing of this investigation compared to the Clarence Thomas process\nWell with the Clarence Thomas process there were some differences there in terms of uh like what happened this time with Dr afford any day hill initially may per accusations and she wanted to stay confident wanted it to stay confidential\nShe didn't want her name news but this was done both uh although it was done at a time when\nWe ... we didn't know about her a a accusations or what her claims were against Clarence Thomas and so this was again done out of the public spotlight and it was only later that he learned of the FBI report and saw what the allegations war then had that second round up fearing here of course this time\nAllegations were made public very quickly and then we learned a factor for its identity shortly thereafter and so now there's a sort of an after the fact uh\nAttempt to try to find more information for the FBI\nHow does the tone of of this process of the hearings a compared to the the the Clarence Thomas hearings\nWell\nThey're both pretty ugly in terms of what's going on in terms of the allegations themselves so for those that [laughter] that recall her old enough to recall that a a ... that Clarence Thomas had said things to harass strong faith and talked about um pornographic movies and some things along those lines which\nAre many people thought were outrageous or even at that time but of course nothing really to the extent of the sexual assault at a Dr Ford is alleging this time so in terms of the the allegations are much more serious I Would say and\nEven particularly in regards to what we're seeing more generally as part of the me too movement and so I think that that's part of what's going in and what people's reaction to a lot of this is as well it's not entirely surprising in a political environment where of course Republicans feel that this is like the eleventh hour allegations baby drummed up on the part of Democrats\nAnd sell you get that that political aspect is going on that can make things even particularly ugly\nYou mentioned uh me too so let's talk about that for just a moment this inquiry a nomination process are happening in the the me too era if we can\nCall it that how does that factor into all of this well\nOne of the things that we've seen in particularly this was the case with a Weinstein allegations that when when people started coming out a lot of people started coming out saying yes this happened to me yes this happened to me hence the idea of me too\nAnd for many years apparently it was kept quiet people were not willing to come forward for a variety of reasons\nIn terms of uh indicating what his behavior had done and then of course we saw a number of other people that have made accusations against them I'm not going to run to the whole list that you know you could recall in the news set of ... people that were fairly famous were then accused and either lost their jobs or had to sort of a lot of that\nGo out of the public eye and so then you see a situation where some people maybe we're pushing back a little bit and so one of the famous ones given\nWhat happened on Saturday Night live uh this last week 'cause that apparently Matt Damon can push back a little bit and say well wait a minute you know we need to maybe take these allegations seriously but there's not an automatic a sentence of guilt you have to look at the the particulars of and given situation some people than\nForeign happy with him for having said that and suggested that so that's kind of where we're at right now is that situation where\nAre you see the believe women are police survivors hashtags on Twitter and that's fine you want to believe people but on the other hand does that mean your throat process out the window and there's the famous case is of course where people were accused\nOf a variety of sexual improprieties all the way up to and including rape\nAnd it turned out not be the case you think of the Rolling Stone in the University of Virginia situation or a few years ago the Duke lacrosse team work and for members were accused of of rape or and turned out to be false allegation is political aspect of that too and so as a result\nYou know people may be neat to back a little bit and that's what makes it hard given the political environment where Democrats while to oppose cabin all Republicans to support him and so for all that into the whole mix of what's going on with the specific\nAllegations in the two in it again can be very ugly\nTim hang loose and associate professor of political science at the University of Iowa where we're talking about the process by which we nominated and confirmed candidates to join the\nSupreme Court of the United states or the Senate Judiciary committee moved Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the full body and there's a one week investigation into the sexual assault and a allegations which were made against\nJudge Kavanaugh we're talking about how that process works with a gym hey go and with you if you care to join us an eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four specifically ... Tim what we'll do is limited inquiry do and what is the FBI's role here\nWell again basically the FBI is going to try to find some information that relates to the allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nUm ... you know it from the Republicans point of view they didn't really see that this was necessary most of them of course was Senator Jeff flake who is a Republican basically called for this along with a couple of other somewhat undecided members ah or at least undeclared members of the center to the Murkowski in college in particular\nUm that basically they're going to the FBI is going to go out and maybe interview some possible witnesses of corporate Dr Ford and her allegations named a couple of other people and even though those people submitted statements through their attorneys indicating that they had no knowledge of of the event that a doctor forward indicated that particular party are gathering\nWith that did you see this did you see that\nAnd so that's what they can do a and perhaps even talk to and I'm not sure they wouldn't necessarily need to given that that Kevin ... already testified before Congress but they may or may not talk to them as well\nUm there's some indication that maybe the FBI would look at some of the other allegations of of women that he'd come forward Ramirez in particular who said that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party or I don't know if they're going to go into the sweat next allegations do seem to be pretty\nOutrageous given the numbers of people that were involved they may not take those seriously but we'll have to wait and see how it how it shakes out in the end\nSo what does the fact that the FBI is involved in this type of inquiry ... about to judge Kavanaugh's nomination in particular and about whether the nomination process in general is a is changing is this something we can look forward to in future nominations do you think\n[laughter] I certainly hope not I'm\nBasically the the process for now I'm a nation's changed drastically even these as I tell my students back in the late eighties with\nThe nomination of Robert Bork and of course we've even heard a few times here the the ... news where a from a given the Republican point of view that the that the charges that were leveled against then now nominee was a judge at the time on the D.C court of appeals as well\nThat they were leveled against him or just just not true in terms of his judicial philosophy is what that might mean they didn't really get into the personal side of things at that point\nBut it seemed to be an indication that Democrats were willing to go very hard against a number of Republican nominees particularly in a situation where they believe that it might change the ideological balance on the court and so that's why to some extent you see where we didn't have 'em much\nOpposition to Gorsuch when he came up because he was replacing Scalia so conservative for conservative really wasn't going to change much or as this time\nOf Democrats and those on the left felt a greater need to oppose cabin off and killed in that he was going to be replacing although Kennedy was as a conservative used as a moderate conservative and he voted with liberals on a number of important issues of war and the and one of them on occasion\nAnd so the concern was that he would change that are you a logical balance\nTim hang on a state where there's more to come with this and when we come back I'd like you to talk of give me I'd like your reaction to what Senator Jeff flake of Arizona suggested a and what came to pass a in terms of how this investigation gun started to like to get your reaction to that\nTim hang all is an associate professor of political science at the University of Iowa he stays with us as our gas you can join us to an eight hundred six four to one two three four what do you think of all of this I'm John months and this was the morning show on the ideas network [noise]\nSo this many many survivors and people are not going to see this investigation as legitimate at the FBI has not given the ... the president or ...\n... what about this as the are the limitations Tim hang over the limitations on the investigation does this concern you at all\n[laughter]\nWell it's certainly a point that has been made by a number of other folks and as far as the specific allegations in terms of the sexual assault investigate now one of the problems of courses that that's not really the FBI got jobs is really isn't a criminal investigation where the FBI would have the power to issue subpoenas and\nForcibly interview witnesses at this point is all kind of voluntary skin it's basically a background check and so they'll have a number of people at the the FBI we'll talk to and so that's\nSort of the approach taken this type of situation and there's been some back and forth as to whether the statute of limitations is run on this particular activity but apparently the the Maryland police or at least the ones in that particular a community where the the event occurred\nAssault occurred have said that they're willing to investigate or somebody files of reporting to today what he has and so I guess that's part of it is that you do have to aside from the problems of of people including sometimes police not taking these things seriously so you do have to report them or else uh nothing's going to be done\nI think you are at least for a for your phone call this morning or you could also join us at eight hundred six four to one two three four\nGloria ... called earlier to say she hopes the inquiry isn't just limited to allegations of sexual assault to like the Clinton and Vince investigation wasn't just about Monica Lewinsky was about whether\nThe president had committed perjury that's what they should be about to did judge Kavanaugh commit perjury is see fit to be a judge\nA what do what do you think about that too\nWell the thing about the Clinton investigation is that it's kind of a whole different situation that you had Ken Starr who was the prosecutor special prosecutor at the time I'm not sure that was a title it but whatever it was\nThat uh he was basically starting with the what was called the whitewater investigation some Arkansas land deals and so it kind of progressed from there\nAnd it's part of that particular investigation you ran into the situation with Monica Lewinsky and the fact that\nThat Clinton perjured himself and so forth so that the the ... there is more the Russia investigation against Donald Trump because again the way the prosecutor goes it that really is a criminal investigation whereas again here what we see is more the just the background checks so it's much more limited just by its very nature and the FBI\nPeople enforce witnesses to testify or give them information and so forth that they would have been a criminal investigation\nSo again they're going out and talking to people but on the other hand one of the concerns again the Republicans had was that this will basically be something on limited because their view is that Democrats are just trying to delay the vote or hopefully\nFrom after after the midterm recently maybe Democrats are going to control the Senate and it would be able to just slow down the nomination so I'm getting that political aspect to it really\nChanges the dynamic in terms of how you can approach this type of situation but that's sort of the environment in which he allegations are made and so it is what it is\nLet's take another call Mary joins us from Milwaukee next to Mary welcome to the morning show\nThank you thank you for taking my call good morning I'm just wondering really when who in ... when they make a decision that OK maybe he's just not the right fit he's just not the right person who makes that decision and how does that come about\n\nMary thanks for that to make all\nWell it basically there are two ways of looking at that one is is that is really the president that make that choice I'm at a Jew we've seen in the past situations where the\nPresident did pull a nomination or got enough money to to pull the nomination uh George W. Bush did this was his nation of Harriet Miers when there was a lot of pushback where people weren't really\nSure about her qualifications in her background so forth are after Robert Bork was voted down is next nominee from Reagan was a fellow by the name of Douglas Ginsburg was another D.C court of appeals judge and it's been learned that he had smoked\nMarijuana while I'm faculty at law school and so this was something that was an embarrassment to the president so his nomination was pulled fairly quickly so\nThe president is is ultimately the one that can do that but of course the Senate has that power to in terms of just having a vote\nSaying no we we reject this person as they did for for Robert Bork or of course you can point to\nWhat the Republican controlled Senate did with Merrick Garland where they said because of the ... the politics of the situation election year and so forth that we won't even have a committee hearing on this fellow\nMarry a thank you thank you for your for your call this morning at the um what part of the discussion after ... after the hearings\nOh was not just a round of of the sexual assault allegations that were made by Dr forward but also the um the way that a judge Kavanaugh responded when it was his turn to testify\nAnd the anger and what some call the almost like political threats like two Democrats you know you're going to pay for this\nA sort of thing that that in itself would call into question the qualification of judge cabinet served on the on the Supreme Court compared to weigh a judge cabinet responded to for example of the way previous Supreme Court nominees had testified to Congress\nWell that really except for maybe one example it's not necessarily a fair comparison to other nominees because other nominees didn't have these kinds of accusations made against them except for\nClarence Thomas and Clarence Thomas came back very strong as well in\nHis response to what was going on a and break how did that too and to a certain extent at least in terms of his opening statement that that was probably a good thing for him it showed that he his his position of courses that this didn't happen he didn't do it he doesn't know anything about this nice being asked to address these charges\nAnd for the most part are an innocent person would react this way it's kind of a funny thing because sometimes we see people react you know they're calm sometimes act that they're very emotional and often regardless of which one\nShould have died after the other way and I know Democrats are saying well this was a job interviews you needed to show that temperament well he during his first hearing but not necessarily aren't second given the circumstances\nWe have to take a break stay with us to him hey go we'll continue our conversation in a moment this is the morning show on the ideas network\n\nHere's a look at the w._b. our weather forecasts to start out the week it'll be cloudy today lots of rain and thunderstorms and temperatures will vary quite a bit when its highest from the upper forties and the north to the upper sixties in the south\nOn Tuesday Morning showers than drying off for a while before and more rain becomes possible in the evening eyes from the mid fifties to the upper six days on Wednesday partly sunny and windy scattered showers and thunderstorms highest from the mid sixties to low eighties\nComing up after eight to twenty sixteen election brought big surprises for some voters and those monitoring the polls I'll talk to an election pull expert about how much faith we can reasonably place in this election polls\n[noise]\nI'm Jane place in with NPR's on points behind\nThe news there are real people with something to say we bring them team round table conversations with women truckers cattle ranchers families in the thick of the opioid crisis honest straight from the heart it's fresh perspective he won't hear anywhere else you want to spend the next on point\nThis morning at nine on the ideas network\nSupport for WPRI comes from the nickel a wolf river scenic by way a scenic route through Wisconsin's north woods offering winding roads fall colors and regional hospitality mornings at a nickel a wolf river by way dot com\nSupport also comes from ... new works ensemble theater presenting wit and wisdom monologues have Ruth Draper laughter unexpected revelations and commentary on the human condition this weekend at overture tickets are at overture dot org\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

that didn't happen now as we approach the mid term elections another round of polls are coming out but should we trust them my guest says yes\nIf you read them carefully Michael ... is a research professor at the center for political studies at the University of Michigan he recently co wrote a piece for the conversation called you can trust the polls in twenty Eighteen ... if you read them carefully Michael welcome to the morning show\nGood to be with your job\nSo let's say you know take the way back machine to twenty sixteen as we mentioned the polls leading up to the election seem to virtually guarantee a Clinton victory and as we all know that\nWasn't the outcome that we got to explain what happened [noise] well\nFirst of all we had a an unusual election and which one candidate won a plurality of the popular vote\nBut the other candidate won more states and secured a majority in the electoral college\nAnd that a mirrored the relative accuracy of the polls the national polls were pretty accurate about a popular vote they estimated Clinton would win by a little more than three percentage points she won by about two\nUm but there was a a bias at the state level and the expectation is that a lot of people had of an easy Clinton victory came from a operations are people that we called data aggregators\nWho take state level polls modeled them into a electoral college vote totals and because of the bias in the polls they suggested Clinton would win a lot of states which she didn't and Donald Trump won a majority of the electoral college\nWell um it\nLooks like children start noticing kind of race or at least pay attention to racial teaches that that is three or four months that they've gotten looking at the faces that day in the in their environment they kick it is something that they stop noticing\nReally early and they got kind of phony theories about it typically if they don't talk to them about it [noise]\nSo what what factors go into helping children form their understanding [noise]\nWell I think parents talking to them about it a year the books and television\nAnd ways of showing that um different types of people NASA that we can sort of watching it live here and enjoy a kind of images of different groups and be willing to kind of label and discuss thin\nAnd he you know they play of research that suggests that African American and Hispanic and I'm an Asian American families do that I'm white families are often had somewhat less come at doing that\nAnd why why is that we know\nOh I think it can come from a pretty good intentions on as well as some kind of level of this comes of it you know that is I mean\nIt makes perfect sense life a African American families do talk about it because they want to kind of a show that kids that they NAFTA and we know that the African American kids thin and Hispanic or Asian American kids notice fewer representations and they can they want to the cat doesn't contend\nThat catches than in some way on with my parents I think often they worry that they're going to make their case racist actually\nTown out a ... hour on two different race or ethnicity and some might come from a good place but it's not necessarily a great thing\nWondering but in ... the children connect the positive or negative representations of gender and race to their understanding of themselves\nWell I'm a couple of things I mean I think\nWhat is that I'm a ... a minority kids well all so to speak about wanting to see the pictures of themselves all feeling sad and do at the top and when they see a kind of negative representations um I think on the other hand um and I and I think general stereotypes\nPlay play roles to write that I'm at the sections of what's appropriate for a boy to do or go to do um can be pretty powerful\nUm but even when kids go to it's kind of phase of really\nKind of covering up the boundaries of boys us go the and which is like around three to five something pretty potent on\nAs a divide us on so I think you know and that is that this representations and that that varied representations ah so that kids can kind of connect across the kind of multiple dimensions so for example in Dora came out\nA win Latino kids are watching and reset just like how how do you feel to door\nAt the ... the Latino boys are like well no I mean yes she's Latino but I'm a boy and she's a girl and I want someone that's me you know I'm so it's a complicated but important kind of area\nWell and then when it comes to gender I mean oftentimes it you know that the imaging their search uh practically from birth the girls you have to have a lot of pain can in in their room and boys blue I mean those are just cultural traditions at least in western culture a\nShow and it's like these are just cultural norms are accepted\nUh how do we uh how do we deal with some of that\nI think by by kind of allowing kids to kind of grace freely by offering then some alternatives I'm an by kind of noticing when we make assumptions souls state and towards things I mean for example when I Would play with my kids and the\nAll the time that I Would notice sometimes the boys young boys where like attracted to Bobby in a way who wouldn't be attracted to body she's like incredibly ... the you know that the parents\nSometimes seem pretty uncomfortable with the idea that this little boy he wanted to know glitzy Bobby I'm thinking about why we're uncomfortable about that and kind of you know\nWhether it would in fact be fine or just the problematic for boy that ... that would be for gold Bobby I think it's kind of useful to reflect on what thinking\nWell let's be honest I mean the assumption there is a boys want to play with Barbie that must be in their day\nYeah might well be that kind of fear and thinking that well really do I really think that if a boy's gonna play with Bobby that's got this somehow making gay and second kind of what would you know why would I be concerned if my kid is gay it's not like you know so I think\nYeah I think thinking through and and kind of reflecting on not as useful\nThere are a lot of land mines out there we're we're talking about whether diverse representation in children's literature and media impacts their perceptions of gender and race later on this hour we'll talk about public libraries and schools are addressing this issue my guest is Louise tomorrow's professor of communication arts that you do\nChildren interpret and respond to media content\nOr what so what children's book or a children's book character has affected your life why and parents how do you talk to your children about gender and race and like to hear from you this morning what's your story eight hundred six four to one two three four eight hundred six four to one two three four\nIdeas that WPRI dot org or you can tweet us\nAt W. P. R. mornings so\nAll of these the representations a a negative or positive of various uh gender or or a and a raise imagery that has to have some sort of impact on the self esteem\nOf children talk a little bit about what what is that impact and and how does that manifest itself\nMedia a pot of a lodge a kind of set of messages about him that is on and kind of what's possible and I think um it's been important that parents have kind of content that they can use to show their kid um\nYou know you're in Port ... come from here a kind of people have your history and he ... it can be into kind of has\nA folks and paintings and TV content that they can use 'em to support that and there's plenty of research that suggests that parents having that\nKind of kind of conversations with their kid help the kids feel better about themselves feel supported and kinda move it salient when they do in fact face\nKind of prejudice a society\nActress Viola Davis loved the book corduroy because she felt represented by the character who was a black girl she still remembers that book go all the all these years later and it was so important that she wrote a sequel so this seems like an example of how media representation can stick with us well beyond childhood\nHow far reaching are the lessons we learned from media\nAll I think they can be tremendously important I think that a single ... to say I'm can kind of lost forever and one had any kind of be\nA someone that felt like a friend fees uh who off it kind of hope a thought what was possible um and so I think they can be really strong and powerful connections and I think\nThat we have to give kids some options right conscious the that one ... to have to take kind of all the possibilities for the kids out there because and it within a given racial or gender group there are lots of kids with different experiences so we need\nThat lots of options for kids to have hope\nCan it can you give us some examples of children's TV shows are books that are good examples of how diversity can be best addressed with children\nI think for example\nIt's great that we had ... stuffing to um you know young African American ... to ... to me rather than just kind of a mine aside kick 'em\nI think it was great that there was kind of on for a while I'm Chinese American but I think one thing that's\nInteresting about these things is while days should can be kind of obvious and transparent said to minority kids\nSo white kids the kids who I'm into that that group sometimes and not necessarily it's clear and kids need adults to kind of point ... connections like oh you know doors Spanish like showy and the class you know get it\n... ... a ... Louis marriage is a professor of communication arts at a you W\nInterpret and respond to media content we're talking about\nWhether diverse representation in children's literature immediate impacts their perceptions of gender and race later on in the hour we'll also explore how public libraries and schools are addressing this issue I'm John months and this is the morning show on the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nAbsolutely they really do a you know in fact did some research suggesting that kind of what parents say a\nParticularly the pre school age kids to even somewhat less important than kind of that body language the kind of wall with which um adults a scene interacting across racial and ethnic lines and so kind of the best predictor of kids a kind of racial attitudes a\nAnd whether the most um has friends of different races and ethnicities so we are sending messages to our kids and then kind of need to think a little bit about what those messages are 'cause the absence of us kind of explicit modeling or explicit conversations it's actually a pretty powerful message\nSo that the whole thing and just become sort of a taboo\nYeah absolutely and I think that's kind of sad and dangerous\nWe're talking about how diverse representation in children's literature and media impact children's perception of gender and race\nWas a ... a professor of communication are said you W Madison she studies how children in ... and respond to media content we'd like to respond to our media content to joining our conversation here at eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four eight hundred six four\nSo how does race and race and gender need to be frankly discuss with children or\nIs it possible for them to form an understanding you buy the mere presence of diversity so let's say that a mom and dad have a a diverse group of friends and they are they are around people of different ethnicities and maybe even different gender roles\nOr if we don't talk to them about it specifically can just our behavior or make the complete picture here\nI think I'll be have you had the huge impact yeah and I think parents having a diverse group of friends\nRaped or I think kids are seeing though it's warm and friendly interactions is probably going to be the most powerful I think there is um but I think in the absence of that because you know not everyone has that those groups of friends or to complement that um I think\nUsing media but then using medium mindfully and being willing to talk about it can be also really useful but assuming that kids will somehow\nJust be able to know that this character is meant to connect in these ways to the kids I see at school or in preschool\nThat I think it's a mistake I think for example TV to pitch and they're often animated and does set of images that animated images are clear to us but not necessarily clear to children\nHow does a diversity of children's authors and TV show producers or writers have an impact on the content that we see\nAll I think that's clearly tremendously important questions of authenticity and and even just thinking about kind of the particular already is and what I mean ... it's kind of getting the details right so when Viola Davis talks about\nA caring about me that the character and cogent right I mean what matters right is that a disco\nIs dressed in and ... send the haves and the mysteries that have no beautiful identifiable way and and just getting the details right um so that a kid can identify with that person I think it's tremendously important\nMore tips do you have a four parents for having the kinds of Frank conversations were suggesting or with their children\nAre thinking about I'm\nSitting down and the heat pot of your
