and gun violence his recent piece there is called one year after Las Vegas so new Texas company is selling bump stocks\n[noise]\n\nAlex you're blond a joins me and we're talking about bump stocks thanks a lot for having me thanks Alex uh we're having a little confusion here uh first off remind us what a bump stock is\nSo bump stock is a really pretty simple pretty simple little mentioned it's a basically a piece of plastic\nUh that replaces a standard stock that goes on the back\nOf a rifle that a gun that a rifle on her would use to steady a weapon against their shoulder when they aim\nA but what's different about a bump stock is that it sort of allows a rifle to rattle back\nAnd forth along or rail after each round is fired yeah using the force of the recoil and if the shooter a applies for pressure on the body of the gun\nOr the bouncing motion created by each a round going off and gone back and forth not real then down the trigger act\nYou know that's a great question I think for a long time American parents have been aware of the fact that we need to look quip our kids from an early age with um honest\nOpen age appropriate information about their bodies and other people's so that we can all us Stay healthy and safe and happy and our skins but\nUm there's something that I think it's becoming clearer now to American families and educators and that's that's sex education has world class sex education the very best has a whole other side which is social and emotional so teaching kids about sex\nHas so much more to do that so much more um to do with relationships and\nEmotions and decision making those kinds of social skills than just biology and medical terminology and the body so we're working now I'm trying to figure out how to bring all that together\nAnd luckily there are some really good models out there for us to understand how to equip kids that those great um but the great things they need to know about learning their own boundaries and learning to respect those other people\nWhat are some of those are what are some of those good examples of how it should be done\nWell for me personally um I had my opportunity to learn as a mom when I moved to the other ones with my family when my first child is still just pretty much just to you know a toddler she was just about two years old we moved to the Netherlands and\nI'm right away as a new parent as I'm looking around and kind of trying to pick up clues about this whole thing about how do we raise kids I started to see Dutch parents and teachers dealing really differently than I'd ever seen before in the United states\nWith the teaching of um basically what I realized later was human sexuality that meant being really open with kids about terminology I'm very open as well about nudity they had a really clear sense of the difference between\nNeeded he that was non sexual every day you know swimming in the wading pool are changing I'm at home with you know in the morning with your family compared to erotic nudity which is you know not something for children\nSo I'm I was starting to see these examples and then and eventually learned that there's there was a lot more going on um that my kid wasn't old enough for yet um sex ed starting in kindergarten and it wasn't\nKind of birds in these talk sex ed in the Netherlands is also like the very best sex ed here in the United states it's based on a model called comprehensive sexuality education and it's K. through twelve so time is spent every year in the classroom\nTeaching children not only about bodies and human reproduction but also importantly\nAbout knowing oneself keeping your self esteem\nStrong and also understanding relationships skills how to make decisions with other people how to have a more egalitarian mindset to break down there working with kindergarten or first graders on identifying and resisting gender stereotypes an inclusive city so I was seeing all that happening\nAnd also realizing that I felt fantastic\nUm as as an adult woman in my body more so than I ever had before and eventually I was able to learn that that had to do with this brief wonderful opportunity I had to live in one of the world's most gender equal countries so when they started\nTo put the pieces together I saw that what the Dutch we're doing those little everyday ways that they were teaching children to be comfortable and I'm not embarrassed about their bodies and kind of rooting out shame from an early age was giving them the confidence to have healthy sexuality some the world's best sexual health\nOutcomes in the world along with some of the highest gender equality in the world\nSometimes we rely on screen and teachers to handle this topic for us I mean is that a mistake does need to start with parents\n[noise] this is a great question and I think that almost anywhere you ask in the world um everyone agrees that parents should and very often want to be the the number one uh go to resource for\nTheir kids about human sexuality however not all parents are up to the task not all of this even really feel like you know those of us who want to do a really great job aren't really sure how we um you know we're we're wondering are we missing something is there is something\nNew that I Need to be teaching my kids that maybe I didn't learn from my parents and so [noise]\nUm yes parents I think feel rightly most responsible for making sure their children educated however even the world Health Organization says that sexual knowledge of one's own body is actually a human rights so in some countries that's taken a lot\nMore seriously so that it was a really\nI'm really reliable safety net really in the schools kind of a a backup system and what's really important about school sex ed that I learned cause they looked and looked at all\nAll different ways that young people can learn about sexuality what's really important about sex ed in schools or churches or community centers the formal sex ed that's offered to children together with their peer group is that what happens is the community all gets the same information at the same time\nSo they can all trust in what they can expect rightfully from one another and build those social norms together and you know I'm someone who cares a lot about this stuff\nHaving come a long way not knowing much about it at all when when I was first I'm\nA parent but but I still feel like you know there's only so much I can do I can't I Can't reach my children's pure collective as much as I Would love to that comes from us as adults in the culture we need to make it more of a norm and in homes and in schools\nBonnie Jay Roach who's the author of beyond birds bringing home a new message to our kids about sex love and quality we're talking about how to change the conversation when it comes to we're learning about our bodies and about sexuality or in America and\nLot more about body positivity what does that mean in this context\nYeah body positivity I mean I think that it really unfortunately can\nHappen from a very early age that went out meaning to it's just an inadvertent thing we ... we can tend to send the message is even babies that certain body parts or maybe a less acceptable or less ordinary less um [noise] even less safe\nThan other body parts which you know that's a moral judgment that's not something that kids are are born sensing but when when we see kids with body Shane kids who are um who can name their nose or their\nTheir elbow but can't quite but maybe they don't even know where it's appropriate words for their genitals um they're getting the message that there's something there's something about these other body parts to be embarrassed about two to feel shame about to be afraid\nOf 'em and that could actually be the dangerous and so what happens is they become less and less spoken of and unfortunately that's that's the\nKind of that mechanism that builds shame and that shame unfortunately creates the silence that can be something that let's say perpetrators rely on\nTo keep their victims silent so\nAnd that's the kind of the big challenge when we look fear motivate our talk of sex education isn't it ... and how does how does that play out\nThat's exactly right so that was something that really struck me when I was learning all these great statistics about a sexual health and the Netherlands and comparing them to our so I'm such an American teenagers do tend to have sex for the first time at about the same age which is about a between Seventeen and Eighteen\nBut um but American teenagers actually have babies unfortunately it more than five times the rate of their Dutch peers and those um those Dutch young people also catch fewer S T eyes and in general take fewer sexual risks\nBut I also learned that those there that are um uh the Dutch\nTeenagers are twice even more than twice as likely as their American ears to characterize their first time having sex\nAs a positive experience that was fully wanted in their control well timed enjoyed and that's when as a parent I went okay I've been thinking about teaching my kids about the birds and the bees from a perspective of what I'm afraid\nOf what I don't want to have happened but I Want to change my mind set\nThis is about thinking in terms of hopes and dreams for my kids like I Do in every other area of their lives and their nurturing and development so my in my book beyond birds and these it's very much about how what is it what was it like for me to change that mindset what did I learn when they went out and looked at\nParents and educators who have already made that shift in how they're\nThey're teaching body positivity insects positivity in a way that helps every child to feel high self esteem and confidence in their skin so that they know that they have the right to\nSay no to say yes to say\nYou know this isn't for me whatever it is they know that they can own those decisions because their bodies Ferris\nBonnie Jay ... within a year and she's the author of beyond birds and be bringing home a new message to our kids about sex love and equality or we still to come we have a conversation about consent and how we teach that\nOr or my child's um you know owned social development who you know the five year old in the room and sometimes I think um I you know I've seen myself do this and and really have worked hard on just kind of taking a deep breath and focusing on you know the\nThe vulnerable person in the room is the small learning child and I'm an adult I can handle explaining to to to the great ads or whoever it is you know later in the moment but sometimes just a real kind of light hearted casual oh yup looks like we're not in the mood for a hug but um you know\nYet it you know be able to tell them I Want to touch it also high five is the good suggestion either but um you know we as adults I think Ken I'm finesse the moment a lot better than a child can when we put that pressure on them\nBonnie Jay Roach who's the author of beyond birds and be bringing home a new message to our kids about sex love and equality we're uh we're talking about teaching children about sex or sexuality in the era of me too and why did report um how\nAh when we're talking about teaching some of these kinds of things to very small children is is just is this something that's really going to get later on maybe we'll be understand it right off the bat\nWell we there's building blocks right so the first thing we can teach very very young children even babies is this gets back to that body positivity questions so you know we we learned from our daughter's preschool teachers in the Netherlands she helped us straighten out\nOur language so that we didn't talk about when we were working on potty training we didn't talk about a diaper anymore as stinky or dirty but just you know full or wet or dry so she taught us to actually several the teacher taught us to you\nDidn't seem to have the kind of values statement late into into it\nUm especially not a negative values statement about body functions\nAh see we can actually use those really early opportunities a diaper changes and ... just to teach kids that their bodies are great their bodies are supposed to be here all the parts\nAnd um and eventually once with that pride in themselves or we can teach them by repetition because repetition is important in every family and just think how many times have you know probably told\nKids to eat their vegetables or get a little more protein so petition is important but what we want to teach about consent\nIs that everybody has a right to their own boundaries we asked first and when someone when someone says yes we want to really see that they mean it\nDo we need to tumor approach to this based on gender at all\nI think that is an awesome question because I Know some\nPeople want to know specifically you know how do I talk to boys about consent or how do I talk to girls about consent and for me I often just come back to the sense that we talk to them in the same way\nAt the same time together in the same room and that goes for all of sexuality education so that we help them to normalize each other's body experiences and psychological experiences of human sexuality and to be\nA little bit more um allied with one another and and knowing that everybody grows up to the human body\nAnd our experiences that that might be different but our experiences that aren't unusual and don't have to be foreign to one another so I think actually teaching kids giving kids the same messages and teaching them the same expectations I'm really sets sets\nThem up to build more egalitarian ism which in fact is a protective factor\nAgainst perpetrated in of sexual violence\nOr how do we how do we modeled as adult how do we modeled things like consent and body positivity to young people\nYeah oh my gosh especially as parents and educators we have so many opportunities everyday certainly we can remind kids in their own play\nBut also in their play with us right I mean I'd probably there are a lot of listeners out there who had a a child either climbing on them or poking mom and I'm doing something that maybe we didn't want in the moment and so knowing that we too don't have to allow another person even a child\nTo touch us in a way that we're not into at the moment you know what maybe I'm trying to concentrate maybe have on the telephone and I it's driving me crazy to have someone talking on my earrings so\nUm I can make sure that I use my voice and say no thank you I don't want that right now or please stop it no [laughter]\nUm and then and to let them know just I mean kids we have to keep reminding them so ah yeah we can model it with them we can also model it with with one another as adults um there's there's so many opportunities in daily life I think one of the most important things that kids can do\nIs to have health care providers who has a strong ideal about teaching consent to a pediatrician who asks first before doing any kind of a physical examination\nAnd the child is says here's what's next is that okay with you I think that modeling from health care professionals is so important that it even comes right down to the dentist and anybody who works on on a body or can can teach a child that they have the right to say yes and no by asking them first before they touch\nWe're much than a minute left but I'd like to have you with a ... a question that parents could ask their child to night to start a conversation about this\nLike to invite 'em invite story face sometimes sharing something of my own so I haven't I might think of a time when you know I could tell my child and you know once when I was a little kid\nAnd I was playing at a friend's house we were we were about housing and I was getting tickled and I was saying stuff because I I didn't want that anymore\nBut my friend and that stuff and I was wondering if anything like that ever happened to you if you wouldn't know what they do or what to say\nOr maybe just simply 'em sit ask a child do you know what you like when when you go to bed um do you like to hear your back tickled or do you like to have your your hair stroked\nUm and just invite a child to\nName their preferences because this isn't\nAll about saying oh it's also about owning are wonderful bodies and learning to live and enjoy them funny\nThing is a force spreading this time with us it was a very informative I really appreciate it\nBonnie Jay Roach

nationwide and a lot of them are at universities and also contract testing firms so they're tested on for their private industry and also federal grants for a variety of reasons because\nThey are so close to us genetically\nMhm so what do what reasons would uh what reasons would there be to retire among\n[noise] well um I used to work in a laboratory with Ninety seven recess monkeys and they're actually like I mentioned really quite similar to us and as a researcher or animal care staff you tend to grow close to them\nAnd um so when the study concludes they're not always terminal studies and the monkeys aren't always re used so instead of euthanize them I'm more and more researchers are wanting\nYou know did it improve morale and do you think it would improve employee retention and they say yes every time so I Do this by case by case by interview\n'em because there's not much in the literature about it but it can be um discouraged in the lab as well so that can be frustrating

because\nThere is such a need for a primary retirement that I Believe there should be a monkey sanctuary built in every state it doesn't matter that climate you can build them with greenhouse as you can build a spacious\nThere's two things raising Canada there's one in Washington and so what we did was we work with um growing domes drawing spaces and we built these two geodesic domes\nThat will have vegetation during the wintertime and we're still working nine completion but they will have walkways to the end or how scene\nAnd then these monkeys will be able to travel between two enclosures 'em over the winter and then the summer they have the outdoor enclosure so they'll be able to have three um enclosures to track travel between so we're excited about that\nOne is the founder and executive director primates incorporated a retirement syringe worry for former lab monkeys we're talking about this project or this morning on the morning show or the drunk about the benefits of having a facility that mimics natural habitat to for the animals\n[noise] yes well it's amazing to see 'em like I mention their abnormal behaviors decrease scene and then the foraging increasing and\nKind of a nice thing about our analyzing everything is what we learned in the morning while we're preparing produce for the monkey stay get anxious and what I thought the lab to when we brought food in the room was one monkey would bite his finger in anticipation really reminded me of a human like\nExcited to eat and come on let's\nGet eating here so um what we noticed was river was pay seen 'em when he was waiting for food walking in circles and then Mars would get upset\nAnd I'm bite his arm actually which is a very disturbing abnormal behavior to see 'em but he doesn't break the skin um but and\n... for wanting to eat and so what we did was as soon as we get there in the morning we scatter out bird seed and Dr banana chips nuts\nThroughout their enclosures in front of them so they're happily foraging while we prep their produce and so we don't see any abnormal behavior in the morning and so we will be writing about that and many other things and sharing with the public involving people\nAt our sanctuary for volunteering in um primate behavior and primary care\nShe'll tell us again how many monkeys are retired at primates incorporated right now\nWe have five total right now with two on a waiting list\nAnd when you complete your facility what's the what's the capacity going to be how many monkeys will you be able to come but once you get everything done well it depends\nThe ones coming in if their social house or not\nI'm what I'm excited about also is our primatologist assess behavior this summer and we were able to pair river with Batman and team own horror arrived so that created a trio and opened up a space for us to a creator waiting list for these two\nSo this first indoor or outdoor um complex that we have\nCost three hundred thousand dollars and I can only house up to twenty monkeys yes but we will build for more complex is over the next ten years so that we can help up to one hundred monkeys and we're willing to share our knowledge and\nI'm expertise with anyone who wants to set up a primate sanctuary so that one can be set up in any state so no monkeys every turn away for retirement ever again\nHow is the retirement change were different from a zoo or other examples of animals in captivity\nWell I had actually tried to collaborate with those views or I'm asked some questions years ago because I felt like they had the funding to maybe help the monkeys for research [noise]\nBut like I said the monkeys come with abnormal behavior and honestly knows who's going to want to show for plucking recess to the public\nUm but that doesn't matter I mean the point is they deserve rehabilitation\nAnd then they deserve peace and quiet I'm an deserve what they want to do what they want to do and so we basically have a strict routine for them so they're not surprised except the one surprises they liked are getting in Richmond\nAnd I'm Carrying open the big to see what's inside but really we try to keep their surprises limited and then um so when we\nAllow visitors in the spring I'm we're only going to allow up to ten people a week to visit 'em so we'll be done with our um facility by then but that will be you know to share knowledge for transparency to show respect to the animals\nAnd then we always have are ongoing and volunteer opportunities where you can volunteer on the land at the sanctuary and then help me and fundraising too that's my primary wrong we have a\nStaff a professional staff of five people up there at the sanctuary ready to train anyone who wants to learn so\nNow here's the term enrichment a few times what a what does that mean in this context\nWe've got an enrichment schedule actually where the monkeys get something different every day\nAnd they also always get scared or forage in the morning and they get forging tops which is wood chips and then a trail mix foraging dried fruit and then they pick through that all day which is a great form then we have frozen\nControl big pieces of fruit on top of their enclosure\nUm and in the morning they get a natural diet of their produce and some monkey channel\nWhich is fortified that's what they get in a lab but we have a fifty fifty died so they get fifty percent monkey trial fifty percent produce and then they get in Richmond in the morning enrichment afternoon in the afternoon and then the pm they get a giant salad\nUm with some fruit and more of their monkey chow so they are\nAlways I'm satisfied have something to do even ... is a great behavior because it's not normal behavior they do spend some of their time\nYou know rest dean and laying down and it's great to see them I'm relaxing Mars he's a singly housed monkey and we provide him with extreme Richmond and how he finds his future mate he's a dominant male monkey\nOn but he likes to be groomed so Hollis staff safely grooms him when he comes up front we have a back scratcher that we can put through the enclosure and scratch him and he lays down and presents for us to groom him and so that's really part of it is giving the monkeys\nWhat they want if they want to be groomed they can if they want to arrest and be away from me and they can um they have mirrors that they watch us all what we're doing is I'm really great to see\nSo we're kind of listeners go if they're interested in learning more about your organization and and how they can support it if that's what they would like to do\nWell our website is primates sink primates I. N. C. dot com and so you can sign up on our email list and view our sponsor monkey program sponsor building program [noise]\nIt'd be great to I'm happier listeners involved in helping us because this is a great community effort like I said\nThere are only nine of these facilities in the country uh ... what do we have to do to get more of them built do think\nThere needs to be a team effort among laboratories she get funds established so that they can be provided when researcher wants to retire there monkeys\nUm it had been denied by funding institutions as non essential funding sometimes and self laboratories could start to agree on retiring there monkeys and addressing this issue that would be great okay\n... thanks thanks for joining us this morning [noise]\nThank you very much for having me any car windows the founder and executive director of primates incorporated in retirement sanctuary for former lab monkey [noise] you're listening to morning show on the ideas that work of Wisconsin Public radio on ... [noise]\nSo if you go to Vietnam for example even though it's completely illegal to order paint Glen or fair or something like that are at a restaurant you can very very easily find that openly for sale\nYou meant a Vietnamese poachers who was particularly successful with penguins a tell us about him why he became a ... attitude toward the trade\nYeah so this guy his name is Tom how\nAnd I met him down in Vietnam the deep south in a place called to men to the really buggy pd place not very hospitable for people it also with bombs very very heavily during the Vietnam War\nA Tom ... arrived in men as a farmer and things are going well but then his son was born and his son had a brain defect so Tom host says he got into hunting to pay for his son hospital bills\nUm however I visited Tom poet you years after the first time I met him his son was healthy Tom whoa but still hunting\nBecause she liked the money I mean you can make\nHalf a year's salary by catching a single tangle and\nYou know did you were here so the what the average salary is what about a thousand dollars a year and a penguin less more or less ... would be worth ... five hundred dollars\nYeah you're talking three hundred five hundred bucks for a single animal\nWhile a show is a is Tom hose a cavalier attitude about breaking the law in law enforcement law enforcement's indifference to this kind of think typical\nOh for sure I mean during my first interview with Tom how we were sitting in his house and a policeman came in to watch TV and see what was going on and he's explaining how he catches these rare endangered protected animals right in front of this guy\nAnd the and the policemen are good and bad and I not at all so is there a lot of bribery though to that in ... is involved here and and um well let's talk about that first and then I Want to follow up on that\nFor sure I'm at the higher levels absolutely bribery grease the wheels of this this operation\nThat can be from paying off a park ranger to take a guard the other way when you're trying to kill a rhino in the field to paying the person at customs to get your I've raised through 'em\nAll along the chain there's bribery\nAnd in addition to bribery you point out examples in in a lot of places where the people who are actually paid to protect these animals are the ones poaching them so we're also dealing with that as well [noise]\nYes corruption is one\nAgainst our ability to get a handle on illegal wildlife trade if you have rangers and the seal protecting animals who are compromised you're never going to get a handle on that situation\nAnd you you would tell the story in your book about being offered rhino horn in in Vietnam a tell us a show that with us\nAh this was one of the most surreal things that happened to me on this reporting project\nA Vietnamese journalists to I'm friends with\nA offered to introduce me to one of his sources who was a Vietnam Vietnam his rhino horn user we met at a ... a busy trendy restaurant in Hanoi and this guy brings\nA ten of Oreos or what I thought was Oreos and hands it to me at the restaurant I open it and inside instead of Oreos as a piece of rhino horn and I was like oh my gosh so quickly tucked away but then as the meal came to a close a rhino horn user just\nBroke out this rhino horn in front of the waitress in front of other patrons that are demonstrating to me how to grind it up into a powder so he could take shots at a later to supposedly prevent the hangover so just this blah they attitude was all throughout\nAll throughout the trait that I witnessed\nI mean I I guess I'm trying to compare this to something that people might run to show you maybe you're you're in a in a restaurant in in in downtown Madison and you suddenly put a line of ... right in front of all the patrons exactly\nExactly unbelievable right it's just hard for us to conceive of\nIt's really crazy illegal wildlife trafficking is a global problem but there there are some huge cultural differences play were animal welfare and conservation are concerned can you do get into bed for about a minute [noise] I mean\nFor sure definitely there's a rich cultural tradition in China and other places that are using wildlife products so ivory has always been very highly valued in China for its beauty rhino horn is considered a cure for breaking fevers\nOr but on the other hand there are these new fangled uses for wildlife products that are driving extinction so rhino horn in Vietnam as I mentioned earlier has become popular hangover cure\nThat a lot of people who use it for that purpose don't actually think it works which is unbelievable they just bring it out to show off in front of their friends and say it it does that thing\n... show how do you overcome these cultural differences\nOr that's the million dollar question there are groups trying to work on anti demand campaigns in Asia because until the demand it stops there there's going to be trade people will find a way to make money off of that\nAh such messages heartwarming messages about cuddly animals and extinctions and these things are not going to resonate with users over there because the regard for wildlife is not what it is here I asked that rhino horn user for example if you care if does go extinct and he just said no why would I care about\nThat so we need to find another way to reach people and convince them\nA lot of experts think that that might be fierce campaigning for example like the campaigns we use here about drunk driving if you drive drunk you will kill a child that kind of thing\nMhm [laughter] yeah I ... this was really amazing the other thing that was amazing to me as I was reading your book is that the United states is actually the second largest market behind China for\nA lot of his contraband and I I Want to get into that ah when when we come back here that's something we'll discuss coming up with a ritual of newer a freelance science journalist who covers the

recent years changed their role we discuss Hal legislation and Wisconsin has impacted the power of labor unions and how union affiliation does or doesn't matter in the twenty Eighteen\nMid term so are you a member of a labor union does that impact the way you vote to what do you think about candidates who get the support of pro union groups and what about anti union candidates eight hundred six four to\nOne two three four then vice as a watchdog economist at the Milwaukee Journal sentinel covering Wisconsin government and politics Dan thanks for joining us today\nThank thanks for inviting me John\nSo historically let's talk about the rule of labor unions in politics\nThat they've been pretty powerful here in Wisconsin and and nationally uh there is a reason that Scott Walker went after um labor unions with act ten and two thousand eleven you know the state Wisconsin was the first state to allow its public sector employees to bargain collectively\nAnd I'm as a result of that and other things the unions became very powerful and became a major part of the Democratic infrastructure\nUh providing money and more importantly um people to get out to vote to help democratic candidates\nSo are you mentioned act ten also a there's a this thing called the right to work law how did those things impact union power in Wisconsin\nOr is it a devastated um I I was talking a just this morning with someone close to the governor and they said ah that they broke the back of organized labor and Wisconsin I'm\nYou know it it the number of ah members of unions in the state dropped precipitously\nUh some unions last more than fifty percent of their members we act the teachers' union suffered major losses ended up laying off more than forty percent of their staff\nI think overall the numbers dropped from about three hundred and fifty five thousand members of of unions in Wisconsin down to a little more than two hundred thousand a couple of years ago and and if there's been a little bit of a ...\n[noise] you know that's a great question I think for a long time American parents have been aware of the fact that we need to look quip our kids from an early age with um honest open age appropriate information about their bodies and other people's\nSo that we can all stay healthy and safe and happy in our skins but\nI'm just don't think it's becoming clearer now to American families and educators and that's the sex education has world class sex education the very best has a whole other side which is social and emotional so teaching kids about sex\nHas so much more to do that so much more\nUm to do with relationships and emotions and decision making those kinds of social skills than just biology and medical terminology and the body so we're working now I'm trying to figure out how to bring all that together and luckily there are some really good models out there\nFor us to understand how to acquit kids that those great the great things they need to know about learning their own boundaries and letting to respect those of other people\nWhat are some of those what are some of those good examples of how it should be done\nWell for me personally um I had in mind opportunity to learn as a mom when I moved to the other ones with my family when my first child is still just\nPretty much just to you know a toddler she was just about two years old we moved to the Netherlands and I'm right away or the new parent as I'm looking around kind of trying to pick up clues about this whole thing about how do we raise kids\nI started to the Dutch parents and teachers feeling really differently than I'd ever seen before in the United states with that\nBasically what I realized leader was human sexuality that meant being really open with kids about terminology I'm very open as well about nudity they had a really clear sense of the difference between\nNudity that was non sexual every day you know swimming in the wading pool are changing I'm at home with it you know in the morning with your family compared to erotic nudity which is you know not something for children\nSo I'm I was starting to see these examples and then and eventually learned that there's there was a lot more going on um that my kid wasn't old enough for yet um sex ed starting in kindergarten and it wasn't just\nUm the old fashioned kind of birds in these talk sex ed in the Netherlands is also like the very best sex ed here in the United states it's based on a model called comprehensive sexuality education and it's K. through twelve\nSo time is spent every year in a classroom\nTeaching children not only about bodies and human reproduction but also importantly\nAbout knowing oneself keeping your self esteem strong and also understanding relationships skills how to make decisions with other people how to have a more egalitarian mindset to break down there working with kindergarten or first graders on identifying and resisting gender stereotypes an inclusive anti\nSo I was seeing all that happening and also realizing that I felt fantastic\nUm as as an adult woman in my body more so than I ever had before and eventually I was able to learn that that had to do with\nThis brief wonderful opportunity I had to live in one of the world's most gender equal countries so when I started to put the pieces together I saw that what the Dutch we're doing those little everyday ways that they were teaching children to be\nComfortable and I'm not embarrassed about their bodies and kind of rooting out shame from an early age was giving them the confidence to have healthy sexuality some of the world's best sexual health outcomes in the world along with some of the highest gender equality in the world\nSometimes we rely on screen and teachers to handle this topic for us I mean is that they need to start with the parents\n[noise] this is a great question and I think that almost anywhere you asking\nThe world um everyone agrees that parents should and very often want to be the the number one uh go to resource for\nTheir kids about human sexuality however\nNot all parents are up to the task not all of this even really feel like you know those of us who want to do a really great job aren't really sure how we\nUm you know we're we're wondering are we missing something is there something new that I Need to be teaching my kids that maybe I didn't learn from my parents and so [noise] um yes\nParents I think feel rightly most responsible for making sure their children educated however even the world Health Organization says that\nSexual knowledge of one's own body is actually a human rights so in some countries that's taken a lot more seriously\nSo that it was a really\nI'm really reliable safety net really in the schools kind of a a backup\nSystem and what's really important about school sex ed that I learned 'cause I looked and looked at all\nAll different ways that young people can learn about sexuality what's really important about sex ed in schools or churches or community centers formal sex ed that's offered to children together with their peer group is that what happens is the community all gets the same information at the same time\nSo they can all trust in what they can expect rightfully from one another and um build those social norms\nI'm someone who cares a lot about this stuff having come a long way not knowing much about it at all when when I was first I'm\nGoing to parents but [noise] but uh I still feel like you know there's only so much I can do I can't I Can't reach my children's pure collective as much as I Would love to that comes from us as adults in the culture we need to make it more of a norm in ... in homes and in schools\nBonnie Jay Roach who's the author of beyond birds bringing home a new message to our kids about sex love and quality we're talking about how to change the conversation when it comes to we're learning about our bodies and about sexuality\nOr in America and a much much talk more about body positivity what does that mean in this context\nYeah body positivity I mean I think they really unfortunately can happen\nFrom a very early age that went out meaning to it's just an inadvertent thing we ... we can tend to send the message is even babies that certain body parts or maybe a less acceptable or less\nOrdinary less um [noise] even less safe than other body parts\nWhich you know that's a moral judgment that's not something that kids are are born sensing but when when we see kids with\nBody Shane kids who are um who can name their nose or their\nTheir elbow but can't quite\nBut maybe they don't even know where it's appropriate words for their genitals um they're getting the message that there's something there's something about these other body parts to be embarrassed about to to feel shame about to be afraid of 'em and that could actually be\nBe dangerous and so what happens is they become less and less spoken of and unfortunately that's that's the\nKind of that mechanism that builds shame and the shame unfortunately creates the silence that can be something that let's say perpetrators rely on\nTo keep their victims silent so\nAnd that's the big challenge when we were here motivator talk of sex education and how does how does that play out\nThat's exactly right so that was something that really struck me when I was learning all of these great statistics about a sexual health and the Netherlands and comparing them to our so I'm Dutch un American teenagers do tend to have sex for the first time about the same age which is about a between Seventeen and Eighteen but um\nBut American teenagers actually have babies unfortunately it more than five times the rate of their Dutch peers and those um those Dutch young people also catch fewer S T eyes and in general take fewer sexual risks but I also learned\nThat those there that are um uh the Dutch\nTeenagers are twice even more than twice as likely as their American goes to characterize their first time having sex as a positive experience that was fully wanted in their control well timed enjoyed and that's when as a parent I went\nOkay I've been thinking about teaching my kids about the birds and they'd be from a perspective of what I'm afraid of what I don't want to have happened but I Want to change my mind that\nThis is about thinking in terms of hopes and dreams for my kids like I Do in every other area of their lives and their nurturing and development so my in my book beyond birds in these it's very much about how to what did it what was it like for me to change that mindset and what did I learn when they went out and looked at\nParents and educators who have already made that shift and how they're\nThey're teaching body positivity insects positivity in a way that helps every child to feel\nHigh self esteem and confidence in their skin so that they know that they have the right to\nYou know for me whatever it is said that they can own those decisions because if I if they're\nFunny J Reynolds stays with us and she's the author of beyond birds and bees bringing home a new message to our kids about sex love and equality or we are still to come we have a conversation about consent and how we teach that\nYou know who who am I really care to protect my own you know social dynamic where you know my great aunt or or my child's um you know own social development who you know the five year old in the room and sometimes I\nThink um you know I see myself do this and and really have worked hard on just kind of taking a deep breath and focusing on you know the\nThe vulnerable person in the room as the small learning child and I'm an adult I can handle explaining to to to the great ads or whoever it is you know later in the moment but sometimes just a real kind of light hearted casual\nOh yup looks like we're not in the mood for a hug but um you know you you know be able to tell them I Want to touch it also high fives in the good suggestion either but um you know we as adults I think Ken I'm finesse the moment a lot better than a child can when we put that pressure on them\nBonnie Jay Roach who's the author of beyond birds and be bringing home a new message towards ... quality we're uh we're talking about teaching children about sex or sexuality in the era of me too and why did report 'em home\nWe're talking about teaching some of these kinds of things to very small children it's just just is this something that you're really going to get later on maybe we'll be understand it right off the bat\nWill we there's building blocks right so the first thing we can teach very very young children even babies is this gets back to that body positivity questions so you know we we learned from our daughter's preschool teachers in the Netherlands she helped us\nStraighten out our language so that we didn't talk about when we were working on potty training we didn't talk about a diaper anymore as stinky or dirty but just you know full or wet or dry so she taught us to actually several the teacher taught us to use more neutral language that didn't seem to have the kind of values statement late into into it\nUm especially not a negative values statement about body functions\nAh see we can actually use those really early opportunities a diaper changes and ... just to teach kids that their bodies are great their bodies are supposed to be here all the parts and um and eventually once with that pride in themselves\nOr we can teach them by repetition because repetition is important in every family and just think how many times have you know probably told\nKids to eat their vegetables or get a little more protein so petition is important but what we want to teach about consent is that everybody has a right to their own boundaries we asked first and when someone when someone says yes\nWe want to really see that they mean it\nDo we need to tumor approach to this based on gender at all\nI think that as an awesome question because I Know some people want to know specifically you know how do I talk to boys about consent or how do I talk to girls about consent and for me I often just\nCome back to the sense that we talk to them in the same way at the same time together in the same room and that goes for all of sexuality education so that we help them to normalize each other's\nBody experiences and psychological experiences of human sexuality and to be a little bit more um\nAllied with one another and and knowing that everybody grows up to the human body and our experiences that that might be different but our experiences that aren't unusual and don't have to be foreign to one another so I think actually teaching kids giving kids the same messages and teaching them the same expectations\nI'm really sets sets them up to build more egalitarian is um which in fact is a protective factor against perpetrated in of sexual violence\nOr how do we how do we modeled as adult how do we modeled things like consent and body positivity to young people\nYeah oh my gosh especially as parents and educators we have so many opportunities everyday certainly we can remind kids in their own play but also in their play with us right I mean\nI'd probably there are a lot of listeners out there who had a a child either climbing on them or poking mom and I'm\nDoing something that maybe we didn't want in the moment and so knowing that we too don't have to allow another person even a child to touch us in a way that we're not\nInto at the moment you know what maybe I'm trying to concentrate maybe have on the telephone and I it's driving me crazy to have someone talking on my earrings so um I can make sure that I use my voice and say no thank you I don't want that right now or please stop it no [laughter]\nUm and then and to let them know just I mean kids we have to keep reminding them so ah yeah we can model it with them we can also model it with with one another as adults um there's there's so many opportunities and daily\nThings that kids can do is to have health care providers who had a strong ideal about teaching consent to the pediatrician who asks for for\nDoing any kind of a physical examination that child says here's what's next is that okay with you I think that modeling from health care professional is so important and it comes right down to to his hand sure anybody who works on on a body or can can teach a child that they have the right to say yes and no by\nAsking them first before they touch\nWe're less than a minute left but I'd like to have you leave us with a ... a question that parents could ask their child tonight to start a conversation about this topic [noise]\nOh yeah well I always like to invite 'em invite stories by sometimes sharing something of my own so I haven't I might think of a time when\nYou know I can tell my child you know once when I was a little kid\nAnd I was playing at a friend's house we were ... we were rough housing and I'd always getting tickled and I was saying stop because I I didn't want that anymore as my friend and stuff and I was wondering if anything like that ever happened to you if you wouldn't know what to do or what to say\nOr maybe just simply um did ask a child do you know what you like when when you go to bed um do you like to hear your back tickled or do you like to have\nYour your hair stroked um and just invite a child to\nName their preferences because this is all about saying oh it's also about owning are wonderful bodies and learning\nTo live in an enjoy them Bonnie thanks
