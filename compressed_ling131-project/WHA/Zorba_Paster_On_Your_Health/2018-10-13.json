Zorba a study on Lebanon kids screen time right right well we've talked about screen time before we talk about a lot yeah we do and that's the ... the reason is it really started with you when I when how old were you when you first got your TV set or twelve twelve see and I was five\nYou know I was five years old and a and the issue with TB as you look at it and you watch it I don't you remember watching test patterns on TV [laughter] yeah I mean what has patterns yes I'm going to be yeah so what happens is a TB doesn't produce much doesn't produce imagination done\nTime for kids because obviously we have more than television we have lots of things smartphones computer screens are really everywhere in this particular study is an observational study funded by the national institutes of health\nLooking nearly five thousand kids age eight to eleven published in the journal Lancet a prestigious journal they looked at cognition\nThey looked at how kids learn and how kids think and they looked and they observed it based on Canadian guidelines on our physical activity for kids that can into recess at school it's moving around\nLess than two hours on the screen and how much sleep they're getting and by the way very few kids actually get get a you know hit all of these mountains and the evidence suggests a number of things in evidence first mostly just\nPhysical activity produces increased academic performance\nWe want our kids to excel in school getting them out for physical activity means removing them from the screen when you're looking on the screen\nDoes not physical activity right we know that by definition of we arsenal eight to nine hours of sleep at night in bed improves academic performance we went there for our kids and why we're there by the way breakfast is really important in school to the cameras\nBut the third thing is limiting screen time and the reason why limiting screen time is important is because you're not engaging in social interactions on screen time most of the time\nYou're not engaging and physical activity for sure on screen time he'll learn anything on screen time you're not using your brain you know naturally looking at you got to use your brain especially if it's growing\nWe're talking about this a lot but the problem just seems to be getting worse all the time\nWell I don't know if it's getting worse you know you look back to the Greeks they complained about their progeny to saying they're not ... you know they're not doing it up but it's it is\nI think to some extent and it got worse once we at television frankly and I think that this is just a variation of that and people say well I don't let my kids watch TV but I let them on a smartphone to study found only one in twenty children in the U.S met all three guidelines sleep physical activity in reduction in springtime\nAnd only and one in three didn't need any of them at all so I think this is the time for parents to take charge to cut down their screen time to interact with their kids to engage in physical activity and to take the bull by the horn because this is how you get smart kids\nDon't run for six to seven for one free or

Wisconsin higher how can we help\nProbably one I Am certain amount of grain sure why can't you\nOh on apple watches great\nShirt that said that you think it's an anti grapefruit cabal that's just the grapefruit so so why do you ask you like grapefruit juice yeah clearly you know what's the grapefruit lovers in America who are really up in arms with ... with exactly that so I got a question of how much grapefruit juice do you drink\nWhy don't now uh-huh\nOkay so there are a couple of things about grapefruit first of all what they found this is probably now two decades ago\nThey found that grapefruit juice is different from the other citrus juices in that it can change the metabolism of certain drugs not on drugs been certain drugs and the metabolism changes for a period of time between when you take the drug and you take the grapefruit juice\nAnd it's the amount of grapefruit juice can change the amount of metabolism of the drugs so some drugs will have higher levels now it actually has to do with something complex which has to do with the liver and it's the pie for safety enzymes system\nTime has to memorize this because it's on the test today in Studio city into peat forty four fifty you've already lost the you know you've gotten a zero on that on the cruise another from another asked for\nTime which is his middle initial anyway but anyway it's right we've all mentioned weapon name means\nWe're that we're that comes from and why a woman needs a trans fats\nSometimes it's because of radiation because of surgery sometimes it's because of issues that have occurred during uh during childbirth and other things so it's a very very different operation and it's for a totally different reason\nSo for instance uh the plastic that is used in contact lens is similar\nTo often plastic that is used in some joint replacement surgery it's the same plastic better contact lens is different than some of the joint replacement surgery that may have some of this plastic in there and I just want to mention it it's not just the material it's a lot more than that how did you choose this particular surgeon you're happy with the surgeon and the institution\nWe called and this is what we were scheduled and we talk to this person and he's Shane neither young or old and she has she seemed like she knew what she is doing and he liked her and he's not worried okay\nSo neither young or old [laughter]\n\nThat's the golden period within life where you are neither young you know so he was happy did you meet with a surgeon personally\nYeah but\nYou're not seeing a ton of problems where people have this kind of surgery and then have mashed problems\nNo I have not and the fact is if there is symptomatic that's the issue and that's why I brought that up at the beginning the symptoms determine the surgery to me more than other presidents have been and bill cornea does not mean it has to be fixed the presence of an ...\nThat has been symptomatic to me is a reason to fix it and the reason is it symptomatic and it causes it causes problems and it does tend to get bigger over time and so the chances that the measure will fail\nAre greater the larger it is because it's not just an infection and problem it's just sometimes the ... he doesn't bind and doesn't do what you want to do I mean there's a failure rate was surgery I I Can't tell you what the failure rate the surgeon can tell you\nA surgeon's will often say in my hands it's less than that and that's because they don't do the same number of surgeries to actually get those numbers but there's a failure rate a ... it's not something I Would necessarily trust Google I Would ask decision with a failure around me they get the information\nI get out talking to a nurse and I and my question good she said the complication weight was only half of one\nComplication rates probably pretty small forty below cornea I Would say but\nBut then I think because I thought well they were wanting in all these really tiny and stuff I don't know\nWhether the complication rate for the bill accordion because you're not dealing with in a very different from the national hernia is probably

one three but before or an ... a study on Lebanon kids screamed telling him right well we've talked about screen time before we talk about a lot\nAnd that's the ... the reason is it really started with you and I when how old were you when you first got your TV set a twelve twelve see and I was five\nYou know I was five years old and a and the issue with TB as you look at it and you watch it I don't you remember watching test patterns on TV [laughter] yeah I mean what has battered seldom could be yeah so what happens is a TB doesn't produce much doesn't produce imagination doesn't stimulate the mind\nThese you a screen time for kids because obviously we have more than television we have lots of things smartphones computer screens are really everywhere and this particular study is an observational study funded by the national institutes of health\nLooking nearly five thousand kids age eight to eleven published in the journal Lancet a prestigious journal they looked at cognition\nThey looked at how kids learn and how kids think and they looked and they observed it based on the Canadian guidelines on our physical activity for kids that can into recess at school it's moving around ...\nLess than two hours on the screen and how much sleep they're getting and by the way very few kids actually get get a you know hit all of these ... and the evidence suggests that number of things in evidence first of all suggest\nPhysical activity produces increased academic performance\nWe want our kids to excel in school and getting them out for physical activity means removing them from the screen\nWhen you're looking at a screen does not physical activity right we know that by definition of we also eight to nine hours of sleep at night in bed improves academic performance we went there for our kids and why we're there by the way breakfast is really important in school to thing calories\nBut the third thing is limiting screen time and the reason why limiting screen time is important is because you're not engaging in social interaction sunscreen ten most of the time\nYou're not engaging and physical activity for sure and screen time he'll learn anything and screen time you're not using your brain and that's why looking at you got to use your brain especially if it's growing\nWe're talking about this a lot but the problem just seems to be getting worse all the time\nWell I don't know if it's getting worse you know you look back to the Greeks they complained about their progeny to saying they're not ... you know they're not doing enough but if it is\nI think to some extent and it got worse once we at television frankly and I think that this is just a variation of that and people say well I don't let my kids watch TV but I let them and the smartphone this study found only one in twenty children in the U.S met all three guidelines sleep physical activity and reduction and screen time\nAnd only and one in three didn't need any of them at all so I think this is the time for parents to take charge to cut down their screen time to interact with their kids to engage in physical activity and to take the bull by their hard because this is how you get smart kids\nOne free or number one eight hundred for six to seven for one three ... some West Lafayette\nIndiana oh why oh can we help\nUm eating in nutrition class particularly weight
