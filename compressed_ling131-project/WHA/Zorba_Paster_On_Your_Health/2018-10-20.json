Zorba exposure to ... and ... and reduced asthma Russ right\nRight so for a number of years we have noticed that as mess on the rise\nAnd about maybe a decade ago started thinking that maybe as mess on the rise because we have an environment that is to sterile\nAnd so naturally what happens is our body when we're infants in young children is we want to develop immunity to basically things that are in the environment and when we don't have things in the environment that are that keep on attacking us\nWe start to attack ourselves\nAnd that produces an increase in auto immune disease and an increase in asthma that has been the theory along in this particular study\nActually shows that indeed may be the case 'cause they looked at children and they looked at infants\nThat went environments where they either have exposure to pass pass such as cockroach mouse or you know and mice you know within the environment they could find that when they examined the home or they had pets which has cats and dogs and indeed those children\nHad less asthma than children who were brought up in a sterile environment who had more asthma so it's really interesting so it's good to have a pet if you have a little well it's good to have a pet and what's interesting and this is they look at areas where they have more asthma which are the inner city so they looked in Baltimore\nIn other words it's what we call in and rich environment these kids are much more likely to get asthma and it houses that were perfectly clean environmentally sterile no cat no mouse no mice obviously in the house\nYou know dogs nothing at all those kids were at a higher risk then at a house that was not perfectly clean where there were animals around and it goes along with this idea\nThat indeed this may this may be an important issue in this by the way the findings were from the University of Wisconsin published in the allergy in clinical andme analogy and I think it's really I think they're important find needs\nSome good reasons I have a pet and here's another well good reasons have a pet also good reasons to let your kids play in church getting in different environments\nTaking them to a parent taking them outside in other words it's not that you know me you know it it's that we can be really to sterile and having your instance just around all that environmental stuff is good for the child and I think this really points that out my mother used to sort of you have to have a teaspoon of George\nBefore before you die yeah do you do it is that what she did she [laughter]\nI mean I don't know I remember the words you actually do that but it is a good reason to have a pet in the house and more importantly it's a good reason to bring your kids are on animals in pets and outside\nBecause this will help possibly prevent them from having asthma and may help prevent them from having other auto immune diseases it's an important reason not to raise your child in a sterile environment\nQuestions ... ... and he's on board for six to ... for one three ... for the call and we go back to the phones and all those or but welcoming a listener and Appleton, Wisconsin high\nSherlock and we help\nCompanies that are providing on her\nOwn food in there and then those mhm for five minutes\nWandering and the\nLeak out and not\nWorry so let me ask you a question do you think it's a great idea to microwave things in plastic\nI don't think so\nOkay so so we're starting with that premise I Would think it's probably not a\nNot a great idea to although the plastic might be safe my first thought would be it's probably not a great idea\nSo here you have a very good example of a sort of an industrial products were making a we're making foods were getting together foods that we think are super food so we're going to sell it to you as these foods are super they're better than normal fruits and vegetables Caesar like the best of the best\nBut then we're going to put it in a plastic product then we're gonna have your microwave this plastic products because of convenience but we're going to still call it a super food so we're going to ... the idea that it's in the middle middle of a plastic products and so you don't have the best of both worlds you have a a food that may be quite good for you\nPut into a you know put into an envelope that might not be good for you\nSome plastics appear to be safe but I can it's so funny I mean I've gotten broccoli from the store and how warm it up in plastic and go what am I doing this is kind of doesn't seem right to me you know I just tell 'em what are the super food say what did they contain\nLike kale kale could check chick peas or like darn\nSure and the reality is taking them and putting them in some microwave safe\nThings like that it's better not quite as convenient 'cause you gotta wash the dish but the fact is that's what I Would do I mean I think those combinations are okay but I always look at a at a price points in other words how much of my pain\nThem to actually chop it up and then how much of my pain for label you know there's chopping it up and and basically paint somebody to ... I'm cool with that sometimes I buy chop vegetables sometimes I chopped them up in his waist when I chopped them up\nAnd then how much you're making a pay for the label\nYou know is it an extra fifty cents because his super on it\nAnd it's a pretty label and I do look at those things you know 'cause I I Can't get over cross comparing cost you know I'll costs comparing till I die I probably with questions here my own CAT scan [laughter]\n\nMaybe I should do that for my kids don't have to bother with that although I'm going to be cremated so anyway uh the answer is keep up with a super foods but I wouldn't microwave and in a plastic bag okay thank you very much for contention\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

noticed that asthma is on the rise\nAnd about maybe a decade ago started thinking that maybe as ms on the rise because we have an environment that is to sterile and so naturally what happens is our body when we're infants and young children\nIs we want to develop immunity to basically things that are in the environment and when we don't have things in the environment that are they keep on attacking us\nWe start to attack ourselves and that produces an increase in auto immune disease\nAnd an increase in ... that has been the theory along in this particular study\nActually shows that indeed may be the case 'cause they looked at children they looked at infants that went environments where they either have exposure to pass pass such as cockroach mouse\nOr you know and mice you know within the environment they could find that when they use them in the home or they had ... cats and dogs and indeed those children had less asthma\nThan children who were brought up in a sterile environment who had more asthma so it's really interesting so it's good to have a ... well it's good to have a pet and what's interesting and this is they look at areas where they have more asthma which are the inner city\nSo they looked at Baltimore Boston New York City's St Louis in other words it's what we call in and rich environment these kids\nAre much more likely to get asthma and in houses that were perfectly clean environmentally sterile no cat no mouse no mice obviously in the house\nYou know dogs nothing at all those kids were at a higher risk then at a house that was not perfectly clean where there were animals around and it goes along with this idea\nThat indeed this may this may be an important issue in this by the way the findings were from the University of Wisconsin published in the allergy in clinical terminology and I think it's really I think they're important findings\nAbout some good reasons to have a pet and here's another well good reason to have a pet also good reasons to let your kids playing dirt getting in different environments\nTaking them to a park taking them outside in other words it's not that you know I mean you know ... it's that we can be really to sterile and having your instance just around all that environmental stuff is good for the child and I think this really points that out with my mother used to so you have to have a teaspoon of George\nBefore before you die yeah ... is that what she did she [laughter]\nI mean I don't know where it was actually a junior but it is a good reason to have a pet in the house and more importantly it's a good reason to bring your kids are on animals and pets and outside\nBecause this will help possibly prevent them from having asthma and may help prevent them from having other autoimmune diseases it's an important reason not to raise your child in a sterile environment\nQuestions for his ... his hundred for six to ... for one three of them were to call and we go back to the phones and all of us or but welcoming a listener in Appleton, Wisconsin high\nIn my truck and we hope\nThat are providing water\n... on the phone and then ... minutes\nOn during the\nWeek and not [laughter]\nQuestion do you think it's a great idea to microwave things in plastic\nI don't think so\nOkay so so we're starting with that premise I Would think it's probably not a\nNot a great idea to although the plastic might be saved my first thought would be it's probably not a great idea\nSo here you have a very good example of a sort of an industry of product for making a we're making foods were getting together foods that we think are super food so we're going to sell it to you as these foods are super they're better than normal fruits and vegetables these are like the best the best\nBut then we're going to put it in a plastic product then we're going to have you microwave this plastic products because of convenience but we're going to still call it a super foods so we're gonna to skate the idea that it's in the middle the middle of a plastic products and so you don't have the best of both worlds you have a a food that may be quite good for you\nPut into a you know put into an envelope that might not be good for you\nSome plastics appear to be safe but I feel funny I mean I've gotten broccoli from the store and how warm it up in plastic and go what am I doing this kind of doesn't seem right to me you know I just want to know\nWhat are the super food say what did they contain\nLike kale chick peas or know for\nSure and the reality is taking them and putting them in a ... for handing them out on the stove\nOr something like that it's better not quite as convenient 'cause you gotta wash the dish but the fact is that is what I Would do I mean I think those combinations are okay but I always look at a at a price points in other words how much of my pain them to actually chop it up and then how much of my pain for the label you know there's chopping it up\nAnd and basically paint somebody to chop it up for me I'm I'm cool with that sometimes I buy chop vegetables sometimes I chopped them up in his waist when I chopped them up and then how much you're making a pay for the label\nYou know is it an extra fifty cents because to super on it and it's a pretty label and I do look at those things at all 'cause I I Can't get over cross comparing cost you know I'll costs comparing till I die I probably with questions here my own cats get if I\nGo [laughter] maybe I should do that for my kids don't have to bother with that although I'm going to be cremated so anyway uh the answer is keep up with a super foods but I wouldn't microwave and in a plastic bag okay thank you very much ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Zorba Paster On Your
