[noise]\nOkay I have a situation with my husband have Seventy seven retired veteran of\nVietnam War he has a ... heart disease and now he's been diagnosed for parking and he's taken several medications and he insists that he can drink is hard liquor and it will cause a problem\nNow the reason and logic he has is that because\nThe doctors told them he cannot drive\nAnd the medicine says no drinking and driving says he's not driving he can drink\nAnd I think that doesn't make any sense at all I figured as much as he's been drinking all these years that he needs to give it a rash and don't drink when the medications that he's taking taken several of them sure\nHow much is he drinking\nDrinking now wants to have like a shot a day or so and he doesn't drink beer and wine eat during

have to tell a woman were to call or you're wrong\n[laughter] something I read something I dread I always wanted the other so first of all let's talk about alcohol\nAlcohol is alcohol is alcohol\nSo whether or not you get the equivalent of a shot but you're doing it in wine in the form of wine you the amount of alcohol is in wine or its equivalent in beer or it's a shot\nYou necessarily go see a doctor for this or do what you need though are shoulder exercises to move around something sometimes we sleep in a funny way we move in a funny way it's just like people have their back go out and you don't really know why it happens\nPeople that can happen with your shoulder and with your tendons and so what you want to do is you want to do shoulder rehabilitation exercises so what you do is you go to YouTube best way to do it\nYou right shoulder rehab exercises put that into YouTube and then they will a bunch will pop up\nAnd then you look at one which is from a physical therapist I mean and

sort of a a they're squeezed essentially because they become inflamed but even if you had that\nThe exercise is make a difference that's number one number two you need to get rid of the information the best way to do that is go to the drugstore get a generic Elise that's new products and generically to tablets twice a day for two weeks\nAnd that'll get rid of the information I mean may not completely get rid of it but it does it well whether or not you paint or not you've got to take it because you want to get the inflammation to settle down in your shoulder\nSo it to tablets twice a day for two weeks and and the shoulder exercises that's what I ...

moving right along I don't know what do you\nMean you know I mean I mean well but I'll tell you about the study and the pluses and minuses and disappointed study because I've been telling people to take vitamin D all the time [noise]\nSo the studies in the journal Lancet number one a prestigious journal highly respected there are really good journals\nThere are journals and their journals that are junk journals where you actually the drug companies actually pay to get the stuff in the journals they're called we used to call them throw weight journals\nThey're hardly any of those any more but the Lancet is a highly prestigious journal [noise] so when it's in there you gotta wake up and say that smell the coffee wake up some of the company means interesting stuff they looked at\nThey it was a study of studies fifty three thousand people looked at eighty one randomized controlled studies\nPeople took low doses of vitamin D medium doses of vitamin D high doses of vitamin D\nThey looked at whether or not they have differences and their bone density and their fractures people men and women over the age of sixty five a lot of them were included and lo and behold the team concluded that vitamin D did not prevent fractures are falls or have a meaningful effect\nAnd bone mineral density in other words it didn't seem to do squat which is very very unfortunate\nNow the editorial that accompany did of course there's always you always want to look at the dark side like what did the study not do and the editorial said that only six percent of the trials were done in populations with vitamin D deficiency well that's true in other words a lot of the trials for just done\nYou know people who are taking vitamin D for them bone him but they didn't actually do measurements necessarily of vitamin D levels before and after\nNow for people with a vitamin D deficiency that the course of a different color in other words you get vitamin D deficient you should get your vitamin D up there so we're not talking about those folks they may still benefit but we're talking about the general population\nAnd it's kind of disappointed but that's life life can have disappointment is vitamin C. never seem to do much vitamin e ever seem to do much multi vitamins and I think it just once again we gotta look at this and say what are we doing but\nCan I ask you in a new concern I ... you can find out whether a him but ...\nYou can actually take a blood test at your doctor to find out ... you'll find them in ...\nD deficiency and if you want to prevent fractures which is the real issue with ...\nYou can eat right at least a thousand milligrams a day of calcium from food you can exercise weight bearing exercise you can do balance and you can increase your strength and that would decrease your ability decrease rather the chances that you're going to have had fracture and when we talk about osteoporosis fracture\nIs the bottom line one eight hundred for six to seven and four won three of them ... and his hundred for six to ... for one three ... let's see if we can help a listener in Buffalo New York Hi\nMike you're cooking you oh you're most welcome my mom vitamin they uh-huh I don't know where\nYou're at it and you got one and I'm In it man and a ha for more\nMore on to a hundred and ... are really good I'm all for your time and I think\nI mean like I Do it for a\nWell first of all let's look at the whole thing about multi vitamins number one you don't take a multivitamin with iron [noise]\nIn other words women should take it while they're meant straight in that's different they need iron but otherwise if you go to a doctor and they do a blood test he'd do a blood test and your name back that can be a sign of colon cancer him believe it or not because colon cancer ... blood into the colon [laughter]\nAnd so we never recommend a multivitamin with ice and next we have people who need it they have an ... deficiency they have a chronic leaving so so there are times that we recommended but generally stay away from where\nI Am by the way out some parents to teach you turn your poop black and can confuse people so we stay away from the\nSecond thing if it's as one hundred percent of ... minimum daily requirements of the vitamin D U S P which means us from Columbia that means it meets a certain standard set by the U.S from a ... which means the vitamin comes out of the tablet in other words it's leeches out correctly when it goes through the God's\nNumber three how much you pay for the vitamin should you buy a name brand or not I recommend if you're going to vitamin you get a house brand they're cheaper and the label is more plane or if you buy something like it\nCosts go our target you'll pay more for the multi vitamin but he's still cheaper\nThan a branded vitamin so for instance if you look at the center from which is a common vitamin send Trump silver central go there probably are eight or ... eight or nine different kinds but I Know sent from silver\nFor men and women over the age of fifty they then have a generic at most drug stores that say equivalent to censure him silver and it's about equivalent so I always recommend the house brands because they're cheaper now\nOnto your question are you doing yourself arm and the answer is no show void in iron you're not doing your sometime now whether or not the little bits of copper and a little bit more as being a little bit more this a little bit more of that\nEvery single study looking at adults taking multi vitamins over the age of fifty had been a flop\nAnd they're big studies were talking about the nurses' health study that physicians health study it didn't show any difference at all between taking a multivitamin and not taking a multivitamin\nAnd ... in the annals of internal medicine a year and a half ago said we should stop this nonsense of taking the multivitamin it hasn't shown anything and so I stopped taking a multivitamin I stopped completely\nBecause I decided it was a flop and if I miss scientists and the data shows that doesn't do much one of my swallowing this bill\nThat's my take you're not doing yourself harm but there is no evidence you're actually doing yourself good\nBecause the vitamin a a true or not\nRight you hit it right on the hand and a Mediterranean diet that's the way to go every day and a lot of people just to finish up on this go well I'm not eating right so I'll take a vitamin and the answer is honk no you're not eating right image you're not eating right and that would be\nYou know people say well I don't have time to exercise and the answer is wrong you should make time to exercise eat right and you'll stay well\nOn any given right absolutely your time\nNice thank you so much you have a
