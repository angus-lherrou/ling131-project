the Seventy four is not a student speaking ...\nIn America there is no such thing as an advanced age maybe when you reach the age of Ninety but certainly not the aged Seventy four\nA but arthritis does relate to your age I mean unless you have rheumatoid arthritis or some other room it's a logical condition the older you get the more your joints ache I mean that's just kind of the reality what it is and seriously if you've had\nA couple of joins who plays clearly you've got some significant arthritis there what do you take for it\nWell I I Am your motion which is I understand the pain

eight hundred for six to ... for one free but Zorba before our next call at ... here there is no safe level of alcohol right\nRight I Want to go with this study because I think it's ... it's interesting it really wasn't done by the Puritans in Massachusetts bake on friday or what\nWhatever it was it's for the the journal Lancet which is a very prestigious journal and this basically was a study of studies looking at what's going on with alcohol how much does it actually costs and I want to talk about not the benefits of alcohol first one that I think may still be there the study does not address\nBut the fact that they said a lot of people die from alcohol related issues the injuries for instance a road injuries it is a big issue self injuries self harm bar fights tuberculosis and it's really a major thing which ... says lots of alcohol related deaths and they estimate that\nIt contributes to death maybe in up to one quarter of the people in one way or another going to treat them with a bar fights now that it but but if you have to look at the age of what occurs bar fights and that occur you because you're in you're you're ...\nYears [laughter] but then when you're in your twenties firefighters that are now than I care for all the time I did not them\nBut when we look at it globally they look at it as you increase the amount of alcohol you increase your risk of death from these other things cancers and other things that are costs liver failure into it\nBut they don't address the issue of alcohol and heart disease they do say\nWe don't think that alcohol is protective even though there are numerous studies that have shown that landed said this study really shows\nThat there is no protective amount of alcohol and it's good but we have to look at the society issue alcohol since it was first invented by humans has been with us and we'll continue to be with us forever if not going to stop being with us\nAnd she told this although they have an issue and it's worthwhile are vast minority population most people drink a drink or maybe two drinks or tax\nBut I think this really looks at the fact that there are health issues the editor I said it's the most comprehensive estimate of the global burden of alcohol in its current in a big in this episode colossal global health issue in small reductions make a difference\nWhether they do if you're drinking too so I shouldn't have a little ... once or twice a week\nI disagree with the study and I don't think it's once or twice a week\nI think that one drink a day is fine and safe and may still be beneficial in superiors to the body and I disagree with this with this study in the Lancet but I think once you get over one drink a day on an average maybe that's when you run into problems certainly with women and once you go for one drink a day\nI think that glass of wine or Wisconsin craft beer maybe with a bit of hops is just fine\nWandering home brute force looks too slow for one three on ... and its own brute force looks to sell them for one through ... listeners with those low in Spokane, Washington\nHigh or can we help well I'm\nI have had a rotator cuff surgery about seven weeks ago I'm Down to two Tylenol five hundred milligrams a day one in the morning with breakfast and one before that time\nI've been told that you shouldn't take the the minute or ibuprofen on an empty stomach\nSo I'm having a piece of uh before I take that goes in the evening is that enough or should I add a little glass milk or something with that\nMhm well first of all you can take acetaminophen an empty stomach number one see them in a fan on an empty stomach just fine so you have several different classes of over the counter drugs first of all you see them enough in class by itself easy on his stomach does not have to be taken with food\nThen you add aspirin aspirin is an anti inflammatory very special should we take them with food if your stomach bothers you if it doesn't bother you don't have to buy the aspirin is in a class by itself is a special drug it is an anti inflammatory buying so\nThen you have the ... the non ... anti inflammatory drugs not the aspirin but that's ibuprofen and and the products and and uh and of course prescription and said and on the whole day along with aspirin might do better with food if your stomach bothers you now evidence\nThat it actually reduces all surveys I don't think there's any evidence of that at all but a lot of people get an upset stomach unless they take it with food so we see if a piece of toast just fine you could have a quarter of a Snickers\nIf you want to happen to be ... well I'm not recommending two hundred and ten calories Snickers but I mean you're having a piece of toes\nQuarter of a Snickers is about the same amount of calories you can have that wouldn't that make you happier\n[noise] well what's your candy bar of choice but the candy bar do you like probably butter angers so had\nA little butter fingers and we've had it I mean I mean come on we have to stop being Puritans about this you have to look in calories in calories\nAnd the other part is very sleep medications tell you to take them on an empty stomach correct that's right\nNow first thing in the morning for breakfast and an empty stomach mhm but do I have an empty stomach after I\nAlways have to leave it generally that's generally assumed that two hours after you eat isn't empty stomach and all that kind of the general thing and for some drugs they do have to be taken an empty stomach and so the drug doesn't absorb perfect example is ... is a drug use for osteoporosis\nPeople should take it in the morning on an empty stomach and they have to wait thirty minutes before eating because\nThe body doesn't absorb the drug very very well so that's a perfect example where if you take it with food in any kind of work\nAnd there are other drugs such as the ... which are type of of uh of antibiotic or if you take it with milk it binds to the milk and it doesn't get absorbed when it comes to prescription drugs\nYou do want to talk to your pharmacist about it if you have a question uh and so that's really an important issue but anti inflammatory generally it's really I always use it does it bother you stomach at all because once again I don't know where the evidence is\nWhich is sort of part of the issue\nRight right well thank you very much that's really helpful to me that\nWell you You're welcome thanks thanks so much for the call we appreciate it at eight hundred for six to seven for one three\nOkay Zorba sometimes a listener and we'll hear you say something they take issue with shocking and I am shocked they just can't let it go say we absolutely welcome I Do anyway
