fear Eisenberg [noise]\nThank you Jonathan it's time to bring out our special guest he's eight Tony Award nominee for his portrayal\nOf sponge Bob square pants on Broadway please welcome it even later\nEven welcome thank you for having me saying to have you here so let's start from the beginning of your spongebob journey yes verify with me where you were and what you were doing when you received the information that you had an audition for sponge\nBob square pants I was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a\nPlush sponge Bob Dole that lived on that in that year so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call and it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer\nAnd they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the ... project but we think you might be the right shape for it [laughter]\nYeah that hurt I when I heard a little bit but I've gotten over it but you didn't know what they were talking about it oh no they\nThey said the the name is chipper chip and just we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm was guys I got this audition how cool is going to be a [noise]\nEmail of spongebob do in the hands\nI like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob [laughter]\nUm that is a crazy coincident it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive high pitched kind of get ugly voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right\nYeah that was like both\nI'm a conscious decision yeah as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure ah I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me so I stayed up you know\nWorking on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the audition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\n...\nYes he says you're you are studying at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and Juliet did\nYou know yeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah\nI had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of his workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid and DC and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious path [laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now his moments so the show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you were jumping in the air\nFor what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been where he has shown up on six\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of the six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned a great job which is right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah and yeah\nWhen you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes every one gasp\nYeah I'd say that I can I get thank you to a you know Jonathan notion yeah my contortion teacher I may have I was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot\nAnd you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it just made you a more optimistic person totally\nYeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privilege of you know being the sponge\nAge shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's been a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yeah and like at first I was like [noise] ...\nI mean like I\nAnd and I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly sponge Bob had these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he was like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one people tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and what sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself\nYou know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days that feels really like a ...\n[noise] uh All right\nAre you ready for an ask me another challenge yes I Am a fantastic of course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the Tony nominated book writer of sponge Bob square pants\nThe musical Kyle Jericho every body\n\nKyle thanks for being on the show as well happy to have you ... okay so you you wrote the book how many years did you have you been working on this project I think I've been\nInvolved almost six years okay yeah here's what is the evolution of the story of sponge Bob square pants the musical what is the evolution of the story has it changed from day one yeah it has\nI mean we knew okay here's the challenge rights but from a TV they're eleven minutes episodes yes we're always show you may be aware as nine eleven minutes long just a little longer a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks the emotional stakes that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening so pretty early we sat on the idea there is going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right right and then the exact version of end of the world's changed a bunch\nBut we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets spongebob\nSpongebob in his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that is going to destroy it and people are freaking out they look fish fish are perfectly fish for\nSure you have to clarify the I just saw myself and every single one of those fish at and\nThey ... who is who is a mammal and there is a subtle thing where everyone ends up turning on the mammal and even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home\nWhich of course seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this entered the script\nWell you know interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy this girl is the only land mammal\nRight there are aquatic mammals there's a whale but she's the only land mammal thank you I like you I I don't mind below so perfect honest [laughter] so anyway we always thought wrote a story about people turning against each other dealing with fear the idea of scapegoating somebody it just you know that's what happened yes\nSo she as the outsider seemed like you know really clear way to tell that story sadly the world has really caught up and I think it's\nFelt even more relevant than it did even when we did in Chicago a couple of years ago right art art imitating reality\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.
