eleven and a bridge park canoe with his grandfather showing off the couch with a day from the expressions on their faces you would have thought they were holding up the world by the gills\nDrawn by other photographs I continued past the staircase to the western end of the whole the very last room was the one the tanker had claimed he was sleeping in the bottom of a bunk bed\nThere was a book on his bedside table to where they're cute borrow whispering in my ear I ventured quietly in and picked it up\nIt was ... uh five of clubs marked the readers progress though from the colors of the underlining as you could tell it was at least a second reading simplicity simplicity simplicity I say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand\nA man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his part at all by dead reckoning and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds\nThe ghost of Henry David Thoreau frowned upon me as well they should\nI return the book tiptoe to the landing and headed down the stairs\nI found tinker in the kitchen frying ham and eggs in a big black skillet two places were set at a small kitchen table with white enamel top somewhere in the house there must have been in a table for twelve because this little one couldn't handle more than a cook governors and three of the world cuts grandchildren\nTankers
