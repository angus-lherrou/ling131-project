he was articulating some new ones of dissatisfaction to visitors the staff photographer while pointing a commanding finger in the direction of New Jersey\n... judging from a distance most people probably assumed that Mason Tate was insufferable certainly he seemed to care about his little glamour magazine to an irrational degree that rumors too well founded this blue to civilian\nThat come up too early this call it too late\nBut it was precisely his nit picking mania that lend a sense of purpose to the rest of us\nWith tape at the helm the work of Gotham wasn't some vague agrarian battle with the seasons in which the outcomes of one's efforts were held hostage to time and temperature it wasn't the drudgery of the fire trap seamstress need laying the same loop over and over until it's one sanity that's being stitched into a same\nNor was it the life of the sea fair exposed to the elements for years at a time returning lego dishes older weaker nearly forgotten unrecognizable to Albany one's dog\nOurs was the work of the demolition expert having carefully studied the architecture of a building we were to install an array of charges around its foundation to go off in an orchestrated sequence such that the building would collapse under the weight of its own infrastructure\nSimultaneously inspiring ... with all and clearing the way for something new\nBut in exchange for this heightened sense of purpose you kept your hands on the wheel or got them lacked with a ruler\nAs visitors sprinted back to the safety of his dark room tape bugs me three times in succession get in here I just moved my skirt and picked up a stunner pat he turned from the drafting table looking especially imperious\nDoes the color of my tie look more accommodating the usual\nNoam ... what about my new hair cut does it seem more encouraging no sir is there anything about me today which would suggest that I walked in and ask for opinion more than I did yesterday not in the least lessen relief\nShe turned back to the drafting table and leaned against it with both arms on it were ten different candidates of Bette Davis\nBetty in a restaurant Betty the Yankees game Betty strolling down Fifth Avenue putting the window treatments to shame the isolated for pictures that had been taken within minutes of each other they showed Betty her husband and a younger couple seated in a booth at a supper club\nOn the table were full ashtrays and empty glass is the only food left was a candle lit slice of cake\nTate waved at the pictures which is your favorite\nOne of them had been pencil by veterans to suggest how the photo might be cropped in it the candle was freshly lift and the two couples smiles at the camera like smokers on a billboard\nBut in one from a little later in the evening Betty offers the last ... cake to the young man at his side as his wife looks on with a narrowed eyes of a heartbeat\nI pulled it from the pile Mr tape nodded sympathetically [noise] funny about photography and then the entire medium is founded on the instant if you allow the shutter to be open for even a few seconds the image goes black\nThink of our lives as a sequence of actions and accumulation of accomplishment suck fluid articulation of style and opinion and yet in that one sixteenth of a second to photograph can wreaked such havoc\nHe looked at his watch and waved me toward a chair I've got ten minutes to take a letter\nIt was addressed to Davis's agent that reference to Mr tastes respect for the actress and his fondness for her husband and the lovely birthday dinner they must have had to do Morocco\nAfter undecided about an upcoming contract negotiation with Warner Brothers and parents ethical about the little seaside town where he thought he saw Davis and the off season\nHe requested an interview\nHe told me to leave the letter on his desk grabbed his briefcase and left for a vacation that apparently no one else it earned\nMaybe Mr Tate was still or did visitors or maybe it was our faulty air conditioning whatever the reason the letter was a paragraph too long a verb to insistent and an adjective too obvious\nWent out and I came out of the building Fifteen minutes later I was so hot even she didn't want a slice of cake we wish to each other well and part of the company at the corner and then it goes back to the girl's room at the automatic where this time I've done the black velvet dress and a bright red ribbon for my hair\nThe first night that wall of a sudden I played cards in my apartment he confessed that he had been seeing his attorney in order to put his assets in trust why because on the twenty seventh of August he was going to Spain to join up with a Republican forces\nAnd he wasn't kidding [noise]\nI shouldn't have been that surprised all sorts of interesting young men were joining the fray some spurred by fashion some by a love of risk most by a healthy dose of misplaced idealism for Wallace there was also the small matter of having been given too much\n[noise] born in a brownstone on the Upper East side with an Adirondack summer house and hunting plantation waiting in the wings Wallace had gone to his father's prep school his father's college and taken over the family business when his father died inheriting\nNot only his father's desk and car but the secretary and driver that went with them to his credit Wallace doubled the business he established a scholarship in his grandfather's name he earned the respect of his peers\nBut all the while he's suspected that the life he was living so reliably was not his own those seven years he had just spent becoming a captain of industry and a deacon of the church\nWhere his father's fifties his reckless twenties had eluded him altogether\nBut not for much longer in a single stroke he was going to shed every aspect of his life that was sent simple familiar and secure and in the month before he left rather than review the disadvantages of his decision with friends and family [noise]\nAmy Abul stranger we were both working long hours so mid week we would meet bit seeing jak for a late supper and a few rounds of bridge nay than highs bitsy was Pennsylvania landed wealth than she was tougher and shorter than she needed to be given her looks\nWhat solidified our relationship was her discovery that I had a head for cards by the second date we were playing the boys for money and fronting the points\nThen when the night was over well this would give me a friendly cats at the curb put me in a cab and we'd had home to our respective apartments for a good night's sleep\nBut the weekends Wallace and I spent those side by side celebrating the doldrums of Manhattan\nOn any given Saturday if there was a party on the water in Westport are always ... bay Wallace woke up was probably invited\nBut the first time he spread a selection of invitations on the table for my consideration I can tell his heart wasn't in it pressed he admitted that these sprawling affairs made him feel a little out of place lord knows if they made him feel out of place I wasn't going to be much help [noise] so we regretted\nWe told the ... and the Kirkland into Gibson's that we would not be able to attempt\nInstead on Saturday afternoons we ran Wallace has errands and the Bentley to Brookes Brothers Michael to pick up the new khaki shorts to twenty third

a nickel on the drum thanked her kindly and want it to the church social\nAfter all where I came from the mission was to pay as little as one could without stealing so on those rare occasions when you got home and discovered you had the on bruised melon you had good reason to suspect you didn't deserve it\nBorn in the back they attended brown and worked at his grandfather's bank that had been my smog assessment of tanker ten minutes after we met\nI took a second look at the photo of this boy with his curly hair and friendly smile and for the first time in months I wanted to see him not to hash anything out I didn't need to talk about eve or what had or hadn't or might have happened\nI just wanted a second shot at a first impression to have him walk into the hot spot and sit at the neighboring table and watch the band so that when the soloist began to pray and tinker gave me that they will did smile I could take him in without assumptions\nFor this little piece of information from Wallace told me something that I should have known all along that has tanker and I had come of age we hadn't been on opposite sides of a threshold we'd been standing side by side\nAs well as look back and forth across the photograph with the probing gays as if the very moment that had been taken was when Mr Gray had lost the last of the family fortune and the two tankers on either side of the assembly represented the end of one life and the beginning of another\nMost people remember the Phoenix for being born from the ashes she said but they forget it's other feature\nWhat's that they asked that it lives five hundred years [noise] the next day while the shipped out well not exactly\nIn Nineteen Seventeen they shipped out young men and pressed uniforms with fair hair and red cheeks gathered in battalions on the docks in Brooklyn shipyards with their duffel bags on their shoulders they marched up the gang planks of the great great cruisers gamely singing choruses of over there

Mary and showed up on the docks after a leisurely lunch\nPassing among the tourists who were already thumbing through phrase books you politely made your way up the gang blank and headed to your cabin on the upper deck where your luggage which had been sent ahead was being carefully unpacked biased to it\nEver since the league of nations prohibited the volunteering of extra nationals in the

a glimpse of possibility to all\nThe theme of the windows was fairy tales drawing on the well known works of the brothers grim ... tons Christian Andersen but in each set piece the princess had been replaced with the figure of a man and the prince was one of us\nIn the first window or young lord with raven hair and flawless scandal a in a state under a flowering Arbor his delicate hands folded on
