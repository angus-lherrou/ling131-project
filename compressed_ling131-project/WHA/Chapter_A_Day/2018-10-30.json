World War one corporal the books editor is Derek ... or wig and it's a two thousand sixteen publication of the University of Oklahoma\nPress and reading the letters of corporal Francis Webster we'll be Sam would chapter one\nThey've found the body of corporal Francis Webster lying alongside of narrow muddy path in the cold autumn woods\nIs rain soaked uniform had been partially cut away and the blood stained bandage gr told his chest Webster had been rolled from a medical stretcher onto the ground after those burying him to a first aid station saw that he had succumbed to his wound\nDiscovered by a small group of soldiers bringing rations to the front lines ... body was clearly recognizable it gained notoriety in the regiment as a fellow soldier serving as an artist correspondent for Des Moines Iowa newspaper\nHis cartoons in illustrations of military service on the battlefield and in the trenches of France provided news to Iowans back on the home front especially to those who desire to glimpse into the lives of their loved ones who were serving over there\nUnable to stop for the body the men carrying warm food for famished soldiers on the front lines continued to move toward the roar of a great battle ahead of them the national guard soldiers of Webster's outfit led by general Douglas MacArthur\nWe're capturing a key strong point in the main German defensive line during three days of fighting Webster's body continued to lie in the cold October rain\nHowever he was not alone the famous forty second rainbow division which Webster belongs suffered over three thousand casualties in this fierce battle that became a turning point for the American expeditionary force the a half\nIn the Meuse Argonne offensive\nWebster's unit was relieved from the front lines exhausted soldiers attempted to process the events they had experienced it was at this time that word of Webster's death began circulating throughout the regiment\nThose who are with Webster before he was placed on the stretcher shared how he had suffered a mortal wound only because he had sacrificed himself or another soldier a new replacement\nVenturing a few days later across the sheltering landscape a small group of Webster's comrades located his remains along the path where they had been discovered with no caskets available Webster was wrapped in the German blanket salvaged from the battlefield\nHis friends carry them down to money trail arriving would have been his original destination and overworked first aid station\nThey laid the falling corporal on a patch of earth designated as a makeshift morgue and one of his friends collected Webster's personal effects to send back home to his parents in Iowa\nThese effects included a blood stained khaki canvas bag to contain not only unpublished completed cartoons of life on the western front but also the art supplies and drawing pads that had made him successful as an artist war correspondent\nTreasured by his family for eighty seven years this khaki canvas bag alone with boxes of various items for Webster short life were donated to the Iowa goals\nNice Betty land for it in two thousand five\nThe journals and yearbooks letters and hard work of his days in school at Des Moines college were in one box\nAnd another there was communication from his friend who's a surprise winning artist Jay ... darling other boxes contained photographs on a tattered journal in addition to bundles of letters that documented Webster's experiences in the military\nWhat made the collection particularly unique where several boxes of original cartoons and illustrations created by Webster while he was serving as an artist correspondent for the Des Moines capital\nThese original pieces of artwork were curated by the newspaper after publication and returned to his family following his death or many of Webster's pen and ink cartoons were published on the home front during the war is water colors and illustrations we're not contributing to their importance today\nWebster's unit to forty second rainbow division was one of the first American units to arrive in France created from the national guard regiment of twenty six states in addition to the district of Columbia\nThe division represented not only the diversity of the geographic regions of the nation but also of its people\nThe divisions early a rival on the western front provided in an opportunity to be involved with many of the larger experiences with the ATF it suffered from delinquent season equipment trained with then used foreign produced a modern military technology\nAnd mastered the art of trench warfare\nAs what the conflict\nAs it evolved into open warfare during the summer of Nineteen Eighteen the men of the rainbow division the transition where the developing fire and maneuver tactics while suffering significant casualties in the woods in wheat fields along the river\nAs men from the original National Guard units fell from shrapnel bullets poisonous gas the ranks of the division where replenished by conscripts some of whom were recent American immigrants who could barely speak English\nWhen American troops assaulted the semi has salient under its own command the rainbow division helped secure a victory\nAnd the autumn of Nineteen Eighteen is the ATF lost over half of its total casualties from the war during forty seven days of fighting and the news article Webster fell to a thumbnail sized piece of shrapnel\nAs a result of Webster's unit experiencing so much of the American involvement in France\nHis writing an artwork contribute to a greater understanding of the conflict through his first hand accounts both written that illustrated Webster provides modern readers with a glimpse of what life was like and the American military of World War one\nSimilarly Webster's published cartoons presented a view of life over there to the home front during the war\nIn sharing what his unit was experiencing overseas Webster faced the challenge of censorship by the American military this censorship was noticeably felt prior to leaving New York for his divisions trip across the Atlantic ocean and after arriving in Europe\nMilitary censorship was an important method didn't discouraging information such as troop movements and unit at dinner vacation and casualties from being used by enemy intelligence to learn the locations of potential allied targets\nAnd for the production of morale impacting propaganda\nThis meant that the letter as an art work he was sending back to Iowa were initially reviewed by an officer from his company for censorship and then re censored by another officer in the regiment\nOf the material mailed to America from soldiers on the western front a small percentage was sampled for additional censorship by the meager staff of the AFC based censor\nAt first glance it would seem that Webster's artwork and letters were under careful censorship and therefore have limited value in presenting an accurate representation of the experiences of the ATF\nHowever Webster's National Guard regiment was supportive of soldiers documenting the units experiences overseas with a visual material\nAnother artist and the regiment and enlisted medic named Lawrenceville Stewart wrote in his illustrated book after the war for permission was given me to make all the drawings I could and by so doing help preserve a record of life and experiences of the Iowa regimen\nCaptain Edward flu or Webster's company commander also supported Webster's cartoon work often providing space that his desk for him to create cartoons or relationship no doubt nurtured by the to serve in closely together and the company's headquarters section\nAs the war progressed and the staff of the ATF base sensors office expanded the challenge of sending his artwork to Iowa became more difficult\nAs a result Webster frequently attempted to avoid bringing attention to his letters containing cartoons for the Des Moines capital by sending them first to his parents who are then tasked with submitting them to the newspaper\nEven though Webster had developed a strategy for coping with HGF censorship outside of the support of his company and regiment he attempted to be discreet with a visual material you plan to have published on the home front\nUnable to share his location on the western front Webster wrote the return address of his letters home and the labeled the scenes of his cartoons from the Des Moines capital as somewhere in France that phrase is also common in the letters home of American Soldiers during the war\nHe suffered from fall and arches and weak ankles in addition to a chronic lung condition he experienced during college\nConcerned he spoke to his good friend Dr Graham a former National Guard lieutenant about the matter\nGraham advise Webster that has fallen arches and lungs would likely pass examination and recommended that he acquire high ankle support to protect against the strain of marching feeling confident that he would be accepted into military service Webster declined to renew his contract with the delight school district\nWas the school year ended in late may absurd traveled to Des Moines where he enlisted in the Iowa National Guard\nHe became a big lower in the machine gun company of the third infantry regiment with a rich military heritage dating to before the civil war\nAnd a few short weeks the unit later federalized as the hundred and sixty eight infantry would be mobilized at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines has prepared to enter into the war in Europe\nAs a recruiter the fairgrounds Webster's artistic talent was noticed by his company commander captain Edward o flu or who used the young recruits skills for drawing maps Webster's soon took advantage of being stationed in his former college town of Des Moines\nUtilizing his connections within the cartoonist field they began illustrating camp seems for Des Moines paper the evening Tribune this association was short lived as Webster became dissatisfied with the presentation of his artwork after editorial changes were made without his consent\nSeeking an alternative publisher of his cartoons Webster made arrangements with another local paper the Des Moines capital the editor William J joined a gun welcome to Webster's contribution to the daily\nAnd provided compensation for his artwork\nWith this relationship Webster frequently submitted illustrations of military life to the paper\nUntil his death in the Meuse Argonne offensive\nWebster's artistic contributions to the Des Moines capital were important serving in a real similar to that of embedded journalists a recent American wars Webster's illustrations provided news from a combat unit to the home front when such information was limited by censorship\nAdditionally positive cartoons about America's involvement in the war were an asset for converting public emotion into constructive patriotic action\nThing darling wrote the following the Webster regarding the value of sharing news from over there\nYou have no idea how anxiously we all follow the news for word of you boys who have gone from here\nAnd proud you do know how the record you fellows are making ... different the backbone of this community Des Moines in Iowa or the first state over the top and the new liberty loan campaigns we had over subscribed our quota in the first ten days\nOh no other state in the union has yet subscribed to limit of course it will go over before the final day and go over big and what I started to say was that Iowa in Des Moines didn't do it themselves it was ... that has led the procession and we have just followed\nYou have no idea how helpless and uninformed we feel over here about what is going on over there\nThe power of artwork to persuade public opinion about the conflict was also recognized by the American government\nEight days after war was declared against Germany president Woodrow Wilson side an executive order creating the committee on public information whose purpose was to package the war for public consumption\nOne sub group of this organization was the division of ... publicity which generated art work to support the war effort\nArtwork produced by painters illustrators designers and cartoonist was implemented to encourage patriotic activities and produce a propaganda well many artists were associated with the division to pictorial publicity others such as Webster we're not and worked independently\nSome of the most common visual art produced was in the form of posters that were used to promote relief organizations like the American Red Cross to recruit employees for civilian work such as building ships and to generate funds through liberty loan drives other\nArt like cartoons also made a significant contribution to the war effort in periodicals newspapers across America to increase revenue for the third liberty loan campaign the Treasury Department even published a book of war cartoons illustrated by forty six American artists\nThe committee on public information also done a fight a need for artist to be in bed with combat units to visually document the war\nSimilar programs were in place with other allied nations and in the late Nineteen Seventeen America followed suit\nEight artist with backgrounds in book and magazine illustrations were chosen to formerly served as official artist with the ATF with rank of captain their work would officially beat a document a pictorial record of the war\nBut unofficially you they were also to create artwork from the battlefield that encourage support for America's involvement\nIt was a task that the eight imbedded professional artist found exceptionally difficult orders from General John J. pursing prevented the artist from being on the front lines during active engagements the result was that much of the work\nShowed the aftermath of battle instead of inspiring art depicting soldiers in action\nSurrounded by death and destruction the artist depicted what they saw such as crippled bodies lying in wheat fields cities reduced to rubble and wounded men on stretchers\nDiscouraged with the lack of inspirational material created by the embed an artist for propaganda purposes the general staff at Washington became critical of the initial artwork being submitted during the summer of Nineteen Eighteen fortunately\nPursing and staff at ATF headquarters supported the work by the embedded artists and argued that the artists were accurately documenting the grim realities of the war\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThey buy the book is somewhere over there [noise] the letters\nBooks editor is dirty or
