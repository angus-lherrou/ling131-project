roughly folded afternoon additions on the nearby ground was an over stuffed release bound with string but for the absence of children that could have been in a way station and a time of war\nA man who was squeezing passed me knocked my elbow he had brown hair and a cashmere coat like one out of keeping with the times he turned to apologize for the briefest moment I thought it was tanker\nBut I should have known better\nTinker gray was nowhere near the ... rapid transit\nAt the end of their first week in Palm Beach even had sent me a postcard from the breakers hotel where she in tanker were holed up since we miss some awful or so she wrote an tinker echoed the sentiment in the margin wrapping little block letters around my address and up toward the stamp\nOn the picture even drawing an arrow pointing to their balcony overlooking the beach she drew assigned stuck in the sand that red note jumping\nThe post script read see you in a week or two weeks later I got a postcard from the marina at Key West\nThe gracious stranger maneuvered across the platform and took a position beside a mouse a young woman who looked up at his approach and briefly met my gaze [noise]\nIt was Charlotte Sykes the typing prodigy who set to my left in the office\nCharlotte took a furtive look in my direction obviously working up the courage to approach list there'd be any doubt I took a room with a view from my purse and open the chapter six\nIt is a lovely oddity of human nature that a person is more inclined to interrupt to people in conversation than one person alone with a book even if it is a foolish romance\n\nGeorge had turned the sound of a rival for a moment to contemplated her as one who had fallen out of heaven he saw radium joy in her face he saw the flowers beat against or address\nThe beating flowers was drowned out by the breaks the train the refugees on the platform gathered their possessions and read it themselves to fight for passage I let them push the way around me when the station was this crowded you are generally better off waiting for the next train\nStrategically position to cross the platform rush hour conductors and little green caps acted like tops the scene of an accident broadening their shoulders and preparing to push people forward it back as necessary\nThe door is open to the crowd surged the blue black chrysanthemum on Charlotte's at Bob's head like flotsam homo see [noise]\nMake room in their shove the conductors shoving high and low like\nA moment later the train was gone leaving a smattering of wiser folk behind [noise]\nMy solitude Catherine\nCharlotte at the last minute you must have doubled back like a Cherokee scout\nI I didn't know you took this train she said disingenuous Li every day she blush sensing she'd been caught in the ... the blush brought badly needed color to her cheeks she should have said more often\nWhere do you live she asked an eleven street or face brightened or nearly neighbors I live on ... a few blocks east about it I Know we're led low is of course\nCharlotte was holding a large document with both hands in front of her waist the way a school girl holds her text books from the thickness of it you could tell it was a draft of a merger agreement or an offering plan or whatever it was she shouldn't have had it with her\nI let the silence grow awkward though apparently not awkward enough\nIsn't miss mark on something else I've never met anyone like her she's just so impressive do you know she speaks French I heard you're speaking it was one of the partners I Swear she can see the draft letter once and remembering word for word\nCharlotte was suddenly chattering it twice or usual pace I couldn't tell if it was nerves or if effort to say as much as possible before the train arrived at her stuff [noise]\nA train arrived at canal street in the door is open Charlotte was talking so fast you didn't notice\nIsn't this year a stop Charlotte jumped she gave a sweet mousy wave and disappeared\nOnly when the doors closed that I saw the merger agreement on the bench beside me cut to the front was a note from the desk of Thomas harbor Esquire with the name of Camden and clay attorneys grows and Harper's prep school cursive\nPresumably he had left off the delivery of this draft on Charlotte by applying a little school boy charm\nWouldn't have taken much she was born to be charmed or intimidated\nEither way it showed a solid lack of judgment on both parts but if New York was many cause the machines and lack of judgment whether Greece that kept the gears turning smoothly for the rest of us and they both ended up getting what they deserved one way or another I lay the agreement back on the bench\n[noise] we were still stole the station\nOn the platform of commuters had gathered in front of the closed doors looking hopefully through the glass like Mr ... fish\nAnd redirected my gaze across the aisle and found the chamber maids staring at me with her ... she looked down at them for cotton document\nWouldn't be the both of them who got what they deserve she seemed to be saying that charming boy with his fine and then see Asian and floppy bangs or they'll let him talk his way out of it and let 'em as wide eyes she will pay the price for both of them\nThe doors opened again and the commuters piled on board\nI grabbed the agreement and got an arm between the doors just before they closed come on sweet stuff set a conductor sweet your own stuff I replied\nI headed up the east side stare and began working my way towards Ludlow looking among the wide brim hats and the brokering hair for bobbing black chrysanthemum if I didn't catch or in five blocks I told myself as agreement was going to merge with an ash can\nI found her on the corner of canal and Christie [noise]\nShe was standing in front of shots and sons kosher purveyor of all things pickled she wasn't shopping she was talking to a diminutive old woman with black guys and a familiar leaf phew new real dress the old woman had this evening's locks wrapped in yesterday's news\nUp an expression of surprised turn to girlish smile Catherine she'd gesture to the old woman and her side this is my grandmother know kissed nice to meet you I said\nCharlotte said something to the old lady and yet ... presumably explaining that we worked together you left this on the train I said the smile left Charlotte's face she took the document in hand oh what an oversight how can I think you forget\nShe posed for a second and then gave in to the worst of compulsions Mr Harper has a meeting first thing tomorrow with an important client but this revision needs to be at Camden ... by nine so he asked if on my way to the office I even addition to a Harvard degree Mr Harper has a trust fund\nCharlotte looked at me with both vine bewildered mount these will hold him in good stead should he ever be dismissed\nShortage grandmother looked at my hands Charlotte looked at my shoes\nIn the summer the shots as rolled over barrels of pickles and herring and watermelon rind right onto the sidewalk sloshing of vinegar ... Brian other paving stones eight months later you could still smell it the old woman said something to Charlotte\nMy grandmother is asking if you will join us for dinner I'm afraid on previously commit Charlotte translated unnecessarily\nFrom canal street I still had Fifteen blocks to go which was about ten too short to warrant another subway fare [noise] so in the language of the neighborhood I slept\nIf Broadway was a river running from the top of Manhattan down to the battery undulating with traffic and commerce and lights than the east west streets were Eddie's where leaf like one could turn slow circles from the beginning to the ever show the world without in\nAnd asked her place I stopped by the evening edition of the times at curbside news to hand the front page offered a modified map of Europe grazed with a gentle dotted line to reflect the shifting frontier [noise]\nIt made me regret having wanted to snoop so she said ... what do you think about Wallace he seems grey day then so\nShe came over and took my place at the sink there was a small ceramic cigarette box on the vanity I let one and settle the John to smoke I watched as she lost her hands from where I was sitting you could see her scar still look read a little inflamed but it wasn't getting much underway anymore [noise]\nThose are some earrings I said I'll tell you though\nTankers to reading your right she let her own cigarettes and tossed to match over his shoulder then she leaned against the wall took a drag and smiled\nHe didn't get to me than who I found them in the bedside table ... she took a drag and not to do with her eyebrows raised\nThose have got to be worth over ten thousand dollars I said man that so what were they doing they're no good day any what [noise]\nI spread my legs and drop my cigarettes in the bowl\nBut here's the best part she said I've worn them every day since we got back from Palm Beach and he hasn't added a peep other sheep I laughed it was a great old ... sort of thing and say well I guess they're yours now\nShe tempt out her cigarette in the basement of her sink you better believe it says\nTo more bottles of burgundy record with a main course they may as well have been poured over our heads I don't think anyone tasted the tend to honor the lamb or whatever it was [noise]\nKeeping an earlier promise eve took with Syria on a tour of the apartment wild Bucky cornered Wallace to secure a hunting invitation for the fall so tinker and I ended up in the living room alone\nHe sat down on one of the couches and I sat beside him he put his elbows on his knees and class his hands he looked back at the dining room as if he was hoping seven from guest would miraculously appear\nHe took his lighter from his pocket snap the lid open and shut and then put it away again it's good of you to come he said it best such a dinner party or another crisis\nShe looks better doesn't she she looks great I told her she'd be fine he smiled enough it and then he looked me in the rye maybe for the first time all evening\nThe thing of it is Katie even I are sort of making a go of it I Know tank I don't think we really sad I think it's great really absolutely\nA neutral observer would probably have raised an eyebrow at my answer if there wasn't much Django in mind delivery and one word responses just to have that way of not sounding very convincing but the thing of it is I meant it every one word of it\nFor starters you could hardly blame them bombing breezes turquoise sees Caribbean rum [noise] these are well established aphrodisiac but so too are proximity and assess city and the threat of despair if as was pay\nLast something essential let themselves in that car crash in Florida they had to help each other again a bit of it\nBack\nWhen the clock struck when we were all in the four year eve and tinker had their fingers at a twice as much to shorter each other up is to show affection lovely evening terrific time let's do it again even listeria was encouraging an encore God Knows why\nWhen the elevator came it was the same man who taking me up early ground floor he announced once he pulled the Cajun shots as if he'd formerly worked in a department store\nThat's quite an apartment with remarked Bucky like a Phoenix from the ashes he replied\nHow much do you think it costs no one answered\nWallace was either to will raise or to disinterested Bucky was too busy trying to bumped his shoulder into mind unintentionally I was too busy wondering when I received the invitation to the reprise what reason I could give for not being able to attend\nAnd yet when I was lying in bed later that night alone and alert\nWith the corridors of my walk up unusually quiet person foremost on my mind was eve\nFor in the years preceding if I had a chance on to the guest list of a dinner party like this one with all its temperate discord and stayed out much too late for school night\nMy one consolation would have been finding eve propped on her pillows waiting to hear every last detail\n[noise] the why to blend in with blackjack is that that that is [noise]\nThe book is a novel called rules of civility anymore tolls published a paper in front of hope you're showing it will turn in next time today\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n[noise] [laughter]\nNo I haven't really\nWalked blah\nBlah\nBlah blah blah blah blah blah and\nAll of them don't even you know leave out of\nThe wall to wall off\n\nAbout it\n\n\nDon't do\nThat\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nHow old are you calling for\nA\nWhile\n\nIt's eleven thirty and you're listening to the ideas network good evening I'm Michelle good coming up next it's world news from the BBC then tomorrow morning after seven in the morning show will examining new alarming climate change report from the United nations\nGets election season Wisconsin Public radio is going beyond the ballot we want to know are you going to vote this year and why Cedric Ellis of Madison\nHe always so\nI think about my ancestors and struggle to even get the right to vote as an African American if my God given All right so I Want to make sure that I sure am an exercise that right\nIn the army you drop KP you might chop a hundred onions in half an hour oil gets so deep and your finger tips for weeks you can smell it every time you take a shower that's what saves ons oranges are now and his landscapes to stink of onion at your fingertips okay\nOkay yeah okay\nLooked over at friend's thinking maybe it was time to go but [noise] she had moved on to grubs lap [noise]\nBut like most village and people Hank was getting tiresome fast so I had good reason to call it a night but I couldn't stop wondering about tankers instincts I mean how should I take it that he thought Hank and I would\nHit it off I decided to take it badly so I gather you're tankers brother\nI'd definitely knocked him off the rails with that one you could tell it was a sensation he hadn't had much experience with and didn't much like how do you know tinker with friends really surprising well he was never much for this sort of back and forth\nMaybe he's got better things to do though he has got better things to do All right maybe he'd get around to do with them if there weren't for that manipulated she's a friend of mine to no accounting for taste right\nThank reached over for another one of Johnny cigarettes\nWhere did this hack get off running down even Ross I thought to myself let's throw him through a windshield and see how he holds up\nI couldn't resist observing Stewart Davis paint a pack of lucky strikes I don't know that he sure he did\nCome to think of it your paintings remind me a lot of is what with the urban commercial imagery in primary colors and simplified lines nice you should dissect frogs for a living I've done that too\nDoesn't your brother has some Stewart Davis's in his apartment you think teddy knows the least thing about Stewart Davis tell you what I bought a ten drama if I told him to\nYour brother doesn't think so poorly of you yeah well maybe you should I bet you do a lot of KP\nHank laughed in Delhi coughed he picked up his glass and tilted to that me with his first smile or the evening [laughter] you got that right says there\n[noise] when we all stood to go it was Hank who covered the check he took some water bills out of his pocket and toss them on the table like they were candy wrappers what about their colors shapes I wanted to ask didn't they have purpose weren't they things of beauty [noise]\nIf only his trust officer could see him now\n\nAfter the drink at that Irish bar I figured I'd seen the last a friend but she got hold of my number and called one rainy Saturday she apologized for having ditch me said she wanted to make it up by treating me to the movies she took me to a string of bars instead and we had a gay old time\nWhen I got around asking why she'd bother to attract me down she said it was because we were so sympathetic oh\nWe were about the same height but at the same chestnut coloring and we were both raised in two room apartments across the river from Manhattan I guess on a rainy Saturday afternoon there was\nSome bad echo so we'd troop to around a bit and then one night in early June she called to see if I wanted to go to the run around that Belmont\nThe runner mountains well apparently on the Wednesday before the Belmont Stakes the track was open to the horses on the card so that the jockeys could give them a feel for the course friends said it was much more exciting than the race itself acclaim so unlikely that the runaround seemed certain to be aboard\nWhoa sorry I sat on Wednesdays I happen to work well that's the beauty of it they open to track at daybreak so each of the horses can get a run in before it gets hot we've zip out on the train watch a few ponies still punched the clock by nine trust me I've done a million times\nWhen friends said that they open the track a day break I imagine this was a figure of speech and we would be heading out to Long Island sometime after six [noise]\nBut it was no figure of speech and this being early June daybreak was closer to five so she came knocking at four thirty with her hair coiled in a tower on top of her head\nWhen we got to Belmont the sun was just beginning to ... its way over the horizon as if it needed to defy gravity to do so for him was defying gravity to see was perky\nBright annoying and let me ask you something she pointed her blouse just looked good on me\nI could answer she talked on her neck line to expose a little more play which at the main gate we passed the unmanned ticket booths pushed through the turnstiles and headed up a narrow ramp into the open air stadium was ear\nHung over the track like you'd expect to see over the surface of a pond in New England scattered across the empty stands the only early riser his were huddled in groups of to wear for St unseasonably cold for June a few feet from is a man in a quilt a jacket was holding a cup of coffee\nYou didn't tell me it was going to be so cold I said well you know it seems like not at five AM I don't and everybody else has coffee I added she's like me on the shoulder Weiner you our\nFriend was scrutinizing again this time the people in the middle of the stands off do I write a tall Thin Man and a plaid shirt stood and waved it was grab and the company of hapless Johnny\nWhen we got to grab the seat he put his arm around friend and looked at me Catherine right I was vaguely impressed that they knew my name she's called friends that and match doesn't have coffee\nGrab grin from inside a ... he produced a lot like it that he tossed to me a service that he headed to a friend and then like a ... he felt elaborately around the bag and so they brought out a cinnamon donut perch upright on his fingertips\nWhich as it turns out is all it takes to secure a place in my affections\nFriend pardon me a cup of coffee I hunched over it with a blanket on my shoulders like a civil war soldier\nHaving come to the track with his parents when he was in shorts the whole excursion to the run around ... was like a return to summer camp for grub full of sweetness Dow Jones and useful fund it quickly gave us the lay of the land besides the track the qualifying courses the importance of Belmont versus Saratoga\nAnd then lowering his voice he pointed toward the panic there comes a first horse\nOn cue the motley assembly rose\nThe jockey wasn't wearing one of those brightly colored checkered outfits that helps the track pretend it's festive he was wearing a brown jumpsuit like a diminutive garage mechanic\nAs he walked the horse from the paddock out onto the track steam rose from the horse's nostrils instilled in us you could hear it when he from five hundred feet\nThe jockey talk briefly to a man with a pipe presumably the trainer and then swung onto the horses back he can't or does it look so that the horse could take in its surroundings circle than position first start a hush fell without the shot of a gun horse and writer took off\nThe sound the horses who's drifted up into the stands and muffled rhythm as clouds of turf or kicked in the air the jockey seemed to take the first ... set an easy pace holding his head about a foot above the horses\nBut in the second turn he urged the animal on he drew his elbows inward and squeezed his thighs around the horses barrel he took the side of his face against its neck so they could whisper encourage once the horse responded\nThough it was getting farther away you can tell that was running faster thrusting it's muzzle forward and drumming the ground with rhythmic precision\nTurned the corner and the beat of its hooves drew closer louder faster until they both to through the imaginary finish line\nThat's pasteurized gr upset favorite\nI looked around the stands there were no cheers no applause the onlookers most of the men offered the favorite silent recognition they reviewed the time on their stopped watches and quietly confirmed a few shook their heads and appreciation or disappointment\nI couldn't tell which [noise] and uh\nTrack to make way for ... by the third horse I was getting a feel for the run around I could see why grub thought the more exciting than the stakes though the stands would occupied by only a few hundred people instead of fifty thousand to a man they were of this you know how does\nHow does that the rail the innermost circle of the stadium where the gamblers with unkempt hair who in refining their systems had lost
