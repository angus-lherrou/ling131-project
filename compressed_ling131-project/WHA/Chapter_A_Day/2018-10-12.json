in the air like spear that's hit its mark she crossed her hands on the desk and looked me in the rye\nCatherine you won't be meeting your stand like close to pat and tucked it beside my right thigh as

day that wasn't in Indiana even said\nMy answer the summer solstice June twenty first the longest day of the year [noise]\nWith acute answer at least that's what I thought at the time on cooler reflection that struck me that when you're asked your favorite day of the year there's a certain hubris in giving any day in June as your answer it suggests that the particulars of your life are so terrific\nAnd your command over your station so secure that oh you could possibly hope for is additional daylight in which to celebrate your lot\nBut as the Greeks teachers there is only one remedy for that sort of hubris [noise] they called nemesis\nWe call it getting what you deserve or a finger in the rye or come up for short and it comes with inappropriate raising pay responsibilities and

file\nBut within a few bites I knew I couldn't finish it the heavier Roma of truffles waft it off the plate and squirrels my senses if I took one more bite of that chicken I was pretty sure and it was coming back up\nWhen they took half of it away at my insistence I was pretty sure it was coming up anyway\nI dumped an assortment of bills on to the table cloth in a rush to get fresh air I didn't wait for the table to be pulled far enough back and toppled the glass of red wine that I didn't remember ordering out or a quarter of my I I could see souffle is being presented to the other couple the suffragette gave a perplexed wave\nAt the door I made eye contact with a rabbit one of the paintings like me it was hanging by its feet from a hook\nOutside I headed for the closest alley I leaned against a brick wall and took a cautious breath\nEven I could appreciate the poetic justice of it if I got sick from the heavens my father would be staring down at the pool of asparagus some trouble with glum satisfaction there he would say is the ascendency of intellect\nSomeone put a hand on my shoulder\nOr you are right here it was the suffragette from a polite distance her husband was watching him through his teary highs [noise] I think I may have over ... said oh it's that awful chicken they're so proud of it but I find it positively ... what\nDo you think you need to be sick you go right ahead here I can hold your head [noise]\n[laughter] I think I'm going to be okay thank you my name is happy door and this is my husband Bob I'm Catherine content contains said Mrs tolerant as if she might recognize it\nSensing that everything was going to be OK Mr Darden edged closer [noise] do you come to Lead Belly fuck often he asked as if we weren't standing in and out of this is my first time\nWhen you arrived we assumed you were waiting for someone you set for you know when you were dining alone we would have invited you to join us Robert said my sister she turned to me it is inconceivable to my husband three young woman would choose to dine alone\nWell not all young women said Mr don't it\nMisses daughter laughed and gave him a scandal eyes look you are terrible then she

tucked snugly among those ... and the worse for wear\nAt Columbus Circle a lanky man and overalls boarded the train with long arms and stumbled on his chin he looked like a past his prime picture from

car the doors closed the train got underway and he produced a little yellow book from his overall pocket he opened it to a dog eared page began reading loudly and I've always that must have been uprooted from apple each\nTook me a moment or two to realize that he was reading from the sermon on them out and they opened his mouth and taught them saying bless it or the poor and spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they mourn for they shall be comforted\nTo his credit the preacher wasn't holding onto a strap as the car rocked back and forth he was keeping study by gripping the size of his righteous little book one got the sense that he could read the gospels old way to bail origin back without losing his wedding\nBlasted all the meat for they shall inherit the earth bless another merciful for they shall obtained mercy blessed that other people are in heart for today's show see God\nBreach was doing an admirable job he was speaking clearly and with feeling it captured the poetry of the king James version and he punched every day like his life depended on it in celebration of the central paradox of Christianity that the weekend weary would be the ones who would walk away with it all\nBut on the roadway local on a Saturday Night all you had to do was look around you to see that this guy didn't know what he was talking\n[noise]\nAfter my father died my uncle Roscoe took me to dinner that his favorite tavern near the seaport Steve a door and he was a big hearted lumbering sort the kind of man that would have been better off at sea that world without women or children or social graces with plenty of work and unspoken codes of camaraderie\nCertainly didn't come very naturally to him to take his newly orphans Nineteen year old niece for a meal [noise]\nSo I guess I'll never forget it\nBy the end I already had a job in a room and Mrs marking Gail so we didn't have to worry about me he just wanted to make sure I was okay see if I needed anything and then he was happy to carve up his pork chop in silence\nBut I wouldn't let him\nI made him tell me some of the tall tales from the old days like when he and my father stole the constable dog and stuck him on the train to Siberia or when they set out to see the traveling tightrope walkers and were found twenty miles from town got it in the wrong direction or when they arrived in New York and Eighteen Ninety five and went straight to see the Brooklyn Bridge\nI heard the stories time and again of course which was sort of the point\nBut then he told me one I'd never heard before which was also from their fur stays in America\nBy that point in New York already had its fair share of Russians there were Ukrainians and Georgians and mosquito bites Jews and gentle has so in a few neighborhoods the shop signs were in Russian\nDollar on Second Avenue uncle Roscoe recalled you could buy ... every bit as good as what you'd find on the news the prospect but a few days after they arrived having paid amongst wrap my father asked Roscoe for all the Russian currency he had left it combined the bills with his own\nAnd then he burned them in a soup pot\nUncle Roscoe smiled sentimental you've got the memory of what my father had done looking back he said he wasn't sure it made all that much sense but it was a fun story on the less\nI guess that's Sunday I thought a lot about my father and my uncle Roscoe I thought about them arriving on the ... out of St Petersburg in their early twenties without knowing a word of English and going straight to see the Brooklyn Bridge the largest tight rope in the world\nI've thought about the meat and the merciful about the bloodshed and the boat and the next morning I woke up the crack of\nDawn I showered and dressed I

at lunch he would virtually they run to the elevator even the other girls were torture him by blocking his way with her literary queries and tight fitting sweaters in self defense he would wave both arms and didn't invent improbable excuses I'm I'm I'm late for the meeting was Steinbeck\nAnd then he would go to the gilded literally the long into the restaurants where every day he launched a law\nThat's what I found the day I quit my job\nHe had just taken his seat and as usual type ... after perusing the menu unnecessarily\nHe ordered soup and half a sandwich and then before turning to the book that was sitting beside has played he did what any of us would do he surveyed the restaurant with a relaxed smile satisfied that his food was ordered is our was empty and all was well in the world\nAnd that's when I approached him a copy of this you know it'd be sad in hand ah ... excuse me I asked are you mark ... certainly not\nThe old additives retort was so emphatic card even him off guard by way of apology he added Martin dirt gets half my age I'm so sorry I'm meeting in for lunch but I don't know what he looks like well he's a few inches taller than I Am with a full head of hair but I'm afraid he's in Paris\nAccording to the society pages but I'm here for an interview I fumbled and dropped my book Mr parish leaned out of his chair to retrieve it when he handed it back he's studied me a little more closely\nYou'll read Russian he asked yes what do you think of the play as far as I get you don't find it dated\nWhat's with all that fuss over the end of the agrarian aristocracy I should take it very old fashioned to sympathize with the plight of the onus sky as\nOh I think you're wrong I think we all have some parts of the past which is falling into disrepair or being sold off piece by piece it's just that for most of us citizens an orchard fits the way we've thought about something or or someone\nMr Perry smiled and handed me back to the book [noise] young

showed I'm Katie Nathaniel parish a cast\nYou must think they have food going on about the meaning of a check off probably mortified he smiled no it was the pinnacle of my day\nAs if on cue a bowl of vicious was was put on the table I looked down at the soup and gave it my best Oliver Twist\nAnd the next day I went to work at Pembroke press says Nathaniel parishes assistant\nWhen he offered me the job he immediately tried to dissuade me from taking it he said I'd find Pembroke forty years behind the times that he wouldn't have enough work for me to do that the pay was terrible a job as his assistant he concluded would be a cul de sac\nHow good were his predictions\nPembroke was forty years behind the times on my first day on the job I could tell that the editors at Pembroke or nothing like their younger counterparts around town\nNot only do they have manners they felt them worth preserving they treated the opening of a door for a lady or the hands scripted regret the way an archaeologist treats a fragment of pottery with all the loving care that we normally reserved for things that matter\nTalents Taylor definitely wouldn't have hailed a cab away from you in the rain ...\nKennan wouldn't have let the elevator doors close as you approach and Mr parish would never have raised his fork before you raised your as he would sooner have starved\nThey certainly weren't the sort to hound the boldest new voices elbow their way of the contracts and then mount a Times Square a soap box to advertise their authors artistic bravery and they were English public school professors who had misread the map into to ban that hapless late got off\nAt the world of commerce stop\nMr Parrish did not have enough work for me to do Mr parish still received plenty of unsolicited manuscripts but his reputation having outlived his enthusiasm for new fiction\nThey were generally sent home and the company of applied regret and apology from Mr parish for not being quite as active as he once was and his personal encouragement for the artists to persevere\nAt this stage Mr parish avoided meetings and administrative responsibility as of all kinds and to circle of serious correspondence said dwindled to a reassuring him from the step to generic ones who alone could decipher each other's faltering script\nThe phone rarely rang and he didn't drink coffee and to make matters worse within days of my starting the calendar turn to July apparently come summer the writers stopped writing editors stopped editing and publishers stopped publishing allowing\nSupport for WPRI comes from St Louis with locations across the region and flexible scheduling St Louis is committed to caring for patients whole life with compassion more information is at choose St lukes dot

cardboard box in the corner it seemed that for over Thirty years whenever Mr parish finished reading an important letter that's where it was ...\nWhen the box was full it was carted off to storage and replaced with an empty\nThis I explain was not a system and so with Mr parishes consent I pulled the fuel boxes from the turn of the century and began building chronological correspondence files alphabetized by author sub categorized by theme\nSo he had a house on Cape Cod Mr parish had avoided going there ever since his wife died in Nineteen thirty six it's really just a shack he would say referencing that self imposed simplicity favored by New England Protestants who respect everything about wealth other than its use [noise]\nSo as I saw it through his old correspondents I Would often find him peering over my shoulder\nOccasionally he would even like a letter from the pile and retreat with it to his office there with a door security closed on the quiet of the afternoon he would revisit the faded sentiments of faded friends undisturbed by all the occasional ...\nIn the distance [noise] the pay\nWas terrible terrible of course is something of a relative term and Mr Paris actually never quantified what he meant by terrible under the genteel circumstances of cold potato soup I certainly hadn't pride so on my first friday when I went down to payroll to pick up my check I was still in the dark\nLooking around I took heart from the fact that the other girls were tripping on well dressed but when I opened the envelope I discovered that my new weekly rate was\nHalf of what I made it quick and inhale [noise] oh my God I thought what if I'd done\nTook another look at the girls around me who with laws a smiles at big on chattering about where they intend to the weekend and it hit me of course they were ... they didn't need the paycheck and that's the difference between being a secretary and an assistant\nSecretary exchanges are labor for a living wage but an assistant comes from a fine home attend Smith College in lens or position when her mother happens to be seated beside the publisher and chief at a dinner party\nBut while Mr parish had been right on these three accounts he couldn't have been more wrong about the job being a cul de sac\nAs I stood in the payroll department licking my wounds Suzie vendor while asked if I wanted to join a few of the other assistance for splash sure I thought why not what better reason for a drink and looming pension ray\nAt cricket inhale when you went out with the girls Utah for around the corner to local well sniper about your day speculate on inter office pinching and then head for the elevated insufficiently ...\nBut when we walked out of the Pembroke press Suzie hailed a cab we all hopped in and headed
