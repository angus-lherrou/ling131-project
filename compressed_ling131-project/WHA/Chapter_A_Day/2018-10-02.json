pursuit of a waiter stumbled in nearly knocked me to the floor she wasn't alone in her condition that formal gathering somehow it had become acceptable even stylish to be drunk before eight\nBut perhaps that wasn't so hard to understand in the Nineteen fifties America had picked up the globe by the heels and shaken the change from its pockets Europe had become a poor cousin all crusts and no table settings\nAnd the indistinguishable countries of Africa Asia and South America had just begun scattering across our school room walls like salamanders and the son\nDrew the communists were out there somewhere but with Joe McCarthy and the grave and no one on the moon for the time being the Russians just sculpted across the pages of spy novels so\nAll of us were drunk to some degree we launched ourselves into the evening like satellites and orbited the city two miles above the earth powered by failing foreign currencies and finally filtered spirits\nWe shouted over the dinner tables and slipped away and do empty rooms with each other spouses gr rousing with all the enthusiasm an indiscretion of Greek gods\nAnd in the morning we woke up at six thirty on adopt clear headed and optimistic ready to resume our places behind the stainless steel desks at the helm of the world\nThe spotlight that night wasn't on the photographer in his mid sixties wizard by an indifference to food unable to fill out his own tuxedo Evans looked sad nondescript as a retiree from General Motors middle management\nOccasionally someone would interrupt to sell it to to make a remark but he spent whole quarters of an hour standing awkwardly in the corner like the ugliest girl at the dance\nNo all eyes were not on Evans instead they were trained on a thin haired young author who had just made a sensation by pinning a history of his mother's infidelity is\nFlanked by his editor at a press agent he was accepting complements from a coterie of fans looking like a sly newborn\nBell took in the

let's look at the pictures\nWe walked into the exhibitions less crowded second room and began working our way around the walls that an an hurried pace virtually all of the pictures were horizontal portraits of one or two subway riders seated directly across from the photographer\nHere was a sober young Harlem identity gamely tilted Boulder for the little French moustache here was a full ride forty year old with a for color coded into wide brim tapped looking every bit the gangsters account [noise]\nHere were to single girls from the perfume counter at Macy's solidly in their thirties a

they have to dress up\nThough taken more than twenty five years earlier the photographs had never been shown publicly Evans apparently had some sort of concern for his subjects privacy this may sound strange or even a little self important when you consider that he had photographed them in such a public place\nBut seeing their faces lined along the wall you could understand the evidences reluctance\nFor in fact the pictures captured a certain naked humanity lost in thought masked by the anonymity of their commute unaware of the camera that was trained so directly upon them many of these subjects had unknowingly allowed to their inner selves to be seen\nAnyone who's written the subway twice a day to earn their bread knows how it goes\nWhen you board you exhibit the same persona

indifferent loaded or on the door\nBut you find yourself a seat and the train gets underway comes to one station and then another people get off others get on and under the influence of the cradle like rocking the train your carefully crafted persona begins to slip away\nThe super ego dissolves as your mind begins to wander aimlessly over your cares and your dreams or better yet it drifts into an ambient hypnosis or even cares and dreams receipt and the peaceful silence of the cosmos pervades\nHappens to all of us just a question of how many stops it takes to for some three for others sixty eight streets fifty nine fifty first Grand Central\nWhat a relief it was those few minutes with our guard down and our gaze inexact finding the one true solace that human isolation allows\nHow satisfying this photographic survey must have seemed to the un initiated\nOld or young attorneys and the junior bankers and dust monkey society girls that were making their way through the galleries must have looked at the pictures and thought that Tour de force what an artistic achievement here at last the faces of humanity\nBut for those of us who were young at the time the subjects looked like\nThe Nineteen thirties\nBut a grueling decade that was I was sixteen when the depression began just old enough to have had all my dreams and expectations do ... by the effortless glamour of the twenties [noise] it was as if America launched the depression [noise] just to teach Manhattan the less\nAfter the crash you couldn't hear the bodies hitting the pavement put there was a sort of communal gas and then a stillness that fell over the city like snow the lights flickered the bans lay down their instruments and the crowds made quietly for the door\nThen the prevailing winds shifted from west to east blowing the dust of the ... all the way back to forty second street it came in building clouds unsettled over the newspapers stands in park benches shrouding the blessed and the

humanity a chase and one\nA few paces ahead of us a young woman who was enjoying the exhibit she couldn't have been more than twenty two every picture seem to pleasantly surprised her as if she was in the portrait gallery of a castle where all the faces seemed majestic and remote their skin was flushed with an ignorant beauty the filled me with envy\nThe faces weren't remote from me the warrant expressions they ... they were all too familiar with like that experience of walking into a hotel lobby in another city where the clothes and the mannerisms the clientele are so similar to your own that you're just bound to run into someone you\nIn another Twenty years old the world would be sitting in basements clubs like this one listening to anti social soloist explore their inner my lays but on the last night of Nineteen thirty seven if you were watching a quartet it was because you couldn't afford to see the whole ensemble\nOr because you had no good reason to ring in the new year\nWe found it all comforting\nWe didn't really understand what we were listening to but we could tell it had its advantages\nWasn't going to raise our hopes or spoils them it had a semblance of rhythm and the surface sincerity was just enough of an excuse to get us out of our room and we treated accordingly both of us wearing comfortable flats and the simple black dress\nThe one to her little number I

tell the rich Boston girl from a poor one after all that's what accents and manners are therefore\nBut to the native New Yorker the Midwestern girls all looked and sounded the same oh sure the girls from various classes were raised in different houses and went to different schools but they shared enough mid western humility that the gradations of their wealth and privilege obscure to us\nOr maybe their differences readily apparent in Des Moines we're just dwarfed by the scale of ours socio economic strata that thousand layered glacial formation that spans from an ash can I'm about ready to
