found myself playing a version of this game in which the road was the one that I have traveled with thinker for New Year's eve to the present\nThis is a game that is one through powers a visualization more than memory the best player puts herself in the travel issues as the journey unfolds using her mind's eye to see exactly what the traveler has seen so that when she walks through the second time
