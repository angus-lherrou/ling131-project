books\nKatie content spelled with two K. is is the narrator of the story she and her roommate eve Ross we're in a dive bar a jazz club on New Year's eve and Nineteen thirty seven when they met tinker gray young banker things develop pretty rapidly including\nNot a little jealousy between the two but all that went to one side when tinkers car was smashed up Manhattan's street and IV was severely injured\nChapter five\nThose first few days after the crash while he was still unconscious tinker led the vigil a few of the girls from the boarding house took turns reading magazines and the waiting room but tanker rarely left her side\nHe had the doormen in his building deliver fresh clothes and he showered in the surgeons locker\nOn the third day eaves father arrived from Indiana when he was at her bedside you could tell that he was at a loss neither weeping praying came very naturally to him it would have been better off if they had\nInstead he stared at his little girls ravaged face and shook his head a few thousand times\nShe came to on the fifth day by the AIDS she was more or less herself\nBut rather a steely version of herself she listened to the doctors with cold on averting eyes she adopted whatever technical language they use like fracture and suture and literature and she encouraged them to adopt her more descriptive terms like ... and disfigured\nWhen she was nearly ready to leave the hospital her father announce that he was taking her home to Indiana she refused to go\nMr Ross tried to reason with her then he tried to plead he said that she would regain her strength so much quicker at home he pointed out that given the condition of her leg she wouldn't be able to climb the boarding house stairs besides her mother was expecting her but eve wasn't swayed not by word\nTentatively tinker suggested to Mr Ross that if even tended to convalescent New York she could do so in his apartment where there was an elevator kitchen service doormen and an extra bedroom\nEve accepted tankers offer without a smile if Mr Ross thought to set up unacceptable he didn't say so he was beginning to understand that he no longer had a voice in his daughters affairs\nThe day before he was released Mr us went home to his wife empty handed but after kissing his daughter goodbye he signaled that he wanted to speak with me I walked into the elevator and their heath rest a novel up in my hand he said it was something for me to cover eaves half of the rent for the rest of the year [noise]\nI could tell from the thickness of the envelope but it was a lot of money I tried to give it back to him explaining that the boarding house was just going to stick me with another roommate but Mr Ross insisted\nAnd then he disappeared behind the elevator doors I watched the needle mark his descent to the lobby and then I open the on look it was fifty ten dollar bills\nProbably the very same tens that eve had sent back to him two years before ensuring once and for all that these particular bills would never have to be spent by either of them\nI took the developments as a sign it was time to strike out on my own especially since Mrs Martin\nThat if I didn't get all those boxes out of her basement she was going to throw me out so I use half of Mr Ross is money to front six month's rent on a five hundred square foot studio the other half I stowed in the bottom of my uncle Roscoe his foot locker\nEve intended to go straight from the hospital to tankers apart but so was my job to move for things I packed them as best I could folding the shirts and sweaters into perfect squares the way that she would [noise]\nUh thinkers direction I unpacked her bags and the master bedroom what I found the drawers and closed its empty tinker had already moved his close to the maids room at the other end of the whole\n[noise] the first week that he was in residence at the barest read I joined the two of them for dinner every night\nWe would sit in the little dining room off the kitchen and eat three course meals that we're prepared to the building's basement and served by jacket staff seafood bisque followed by tender line in Brussels sprouts capped off with coffee and chocolate moose\nBut on the seventh night after ... release when I talk to her in and gave her a kiss she stopped me Katie she said you know I'll love you till doomsday I sat on the bed beside her feelings mutual I Know she said I took her hand and squeezed she squeezed back [noise]\nI think it would be better if you didn't come for a while All right you understand don't you sure I said\nBecause I did understand at least I understood enough\nIt wasn't about who had dibs no or who was sitting next to home and the cinema the game that changed or rather read wasn't the game at all anymore it was a matter of making it through the night which is often harder than it sounds and always a very individual business\nBy the time a cab came to a stop on Central Park west the sleep to turn to freezing rain Pete than I doormen was there at the curb to meet me with an umbrella [noise]\nThe door opened on a private four year a perfect example of Greek Revival elegance with a park in Florida and white ... and the pre impression is still life hanging on the wall\nTanker was sitting on a side chair with his arms on his knees and his head lowered it looked like he was back outside the emergency room when I stepped off the elevator he was visibly relieved as if he'd be gone to worry that I wasn't going to show\nYou took both my hands in his the features of his face it's often does if he put on the ten pounds that eve had lost in the hospital Kate thanks for coming good to see\nHe was talking a little under his breath it raised my on ten\nTanker does even know that I'm here yes yes yes of course she's excited to see you I just I I wanted to explain she's she's been having a tough go of that lately especially at night so I Try to stay in as much as I can she's she's just better when she has company\nI took off my coat and laid on the other side jak it should have told me something about tinker state of mind that he hadn't asked me for it I'm not sure how late I'm going to be can you stay until eleven sure at twelve I can stay as late as you need me to tinker\nHe took my hands again and then let them go\nOh come on in eighth Katie's here we walked through the door into the living room if tankers for your was classically decorated it was something of a slight of hand because it was the only room in the apartment with furnishings from before the sinking of the Titanic\nThe living room a grand square with terrorists windows overlooking Central Park looked like it had been airlifted right out\nTwenty nine world's fair it had three white couches and two black means found a road chairs in tight formation around the glass stopped cocktail table which was artfully arranged with a stack of novels a brass ashtray deco Iran miniature of an airplane\nThere was no sat in a velvet no Paisley no rough texture as a rounded edges just interlocking rectangles that reinforced a general sense of abstraction the machine for a living I think the French called it\nAnd there was eve lounging in the middle of the works in the new white dress she was reclining on one of the couches with one arm behind her head and the other at her side it was a been here all my life ... ... is\nWith the lights of the city right behind her and the martini glass on the carpet she looked like an advertisement for\nBeing in a car wreck\nWas only when you got closer that you could see the damage on the left side of her face there were two converging scars that cut all the way from temple ... what symmetry remained was spoiled by this like drew the edge of her mouth as if she was a victim of a stroke\nIn the matter she was sitting her left leg looked only slightly twisted but peeking from under the him ever address you could see where the graft had left\nA skin of a plucked chicken hey hey Kate I leaned over to give her a kiss without hesitation she offered her right cheek reflexes having already adapted to her new condition I sat on the opposite couch\nHow you're feeling I asked about it well you've been saying oh good for you it's like a drink tankers sweaty what'd you\nThink are having sat down he was behind the empty couch leaning on its back with both arms of course he was standing up ... what would you like Katie we were just having martinis I'm happy to make you a freshman\nI'll take what's in shaker sure why not\nTake our came around the couch with a glass and reached for the plane was on the cocktail table the fuselage came up out of the wings or with a piece of deco teetering on the edge of fashion tinker plucked off the nose of the plane and filled my glass he hesitated before putting the shaker back\nAs on those first nights out of the hospital when he was ready I helped her back to what room I helped her take off her stockings and address I talked to her in a cast her forehead [noise] she reached up took my forehead in their hands and kissed me back\nIt was good to see you Katie do you want me to turn out the light she died at the bedside table oh look at this she grown Charlotte ... Emily brown said Jane Austin [noise] checkers rehabilitation plan but didn't they all died spin states\nI think Austin dead well the rest of the might as well have\nRemarked caught me off guard that I burst out laughing evil after she left so hard that her hair cell over her face was the first good laugh the two of us had had since the first week of the year\nWhen I turned out her light Abe said there was no point in my waiting for tinker that I should let myself out and I almost did but he had made me promise\nSo I turned off the lights in the hall and most of the lights in the living room I settled down on the couch with a white throw over my shoulders I pulled the book from the middle of the pile and started reading was paroled bucks good earth when it bugged me down on page two I turn to page a hundred and four and started again\nDidn't help\nMy gaze settled on the pyramid of books I considered the selection of title is for a moment when I carry the stack down the whole the maids room and swap the law for ten of the detective novels when I put them on the living room table there was no need to arrange the vertical lord it because they were all exactly the same size\nThen I went to make myself some closed kitchen eggs\nA crack two eggs in the bowl and wish them with greater cheese and nerves I poured them into a pan of heated oil and cover them with a lid something about heating the oil and putting on the lid makes the eggs puff on contact and they brown without burning\nIt's the way my father used to repair eggs for me when I was a girl that we never ate them for breakfast they tasted best it used to say when the kitchen was closed\nI was eating the last off my plate when I heard tinker calling my name in hushed tones oh I'm In the kitchen\nHe came in with that relieved look there you are he said here I Am he dropped into a chair his hair was comb does tie sport or the Chris wins or not but his turnout couldn't hide the fact that he was weary\nHow to go he asked tentatively oh fighting eighties tougher than you think she's going to be okay\nI almost went on to say that he should relax so that'll give easy some space let nature take its course but then I wasn't the one who had been driving the car we have an office in Palm Beach he said after a moment I'm thinking of taking her down there for a few weeks warm weather new surroundings where they\nThink sounds great I just think she could use a change of pace you look like you could use one yourself\nThe empty played with the eyes of a well behaved dog so I made him his own batch of

we ... the Sherry of drifted from topic to topic and not necessarily hushed tones\nThe notion of Florida broke mentioned to the keys which brought memories to tinker of reading Treasure Island as a

circling the trend of these people and all the brightly colored possibilities dangle by the New Year's to within reach\nOld times as my father used to say if you're not careful bell gotcha like a fish\nIn the foyer tanker truck both my hands in his again\nIt's good to see Kay\nWas good to see to as I step back he didn't immediately let go we looked as if he was wrestling with whether to say something instead with IV asleep at the end of the whole he kissed me\nOh it wasn't a force focus it was an inquiry all I had to do was leaning a little forward and he would have raptors arms around me\nBut at this juncture where would that have gotten anybody\nI've read my hands and put a palm on the smooth skin of his cheek taking comfort in the will counsel patience for that which bears all things believes all things hope solve things and most important in Georgetown\nUniversity week one tanker gray\nThe elevator cables ... past his car approached a drop by hand before Hamilton pulled back the elevator door tinker nodded and put his hands in his jacket pockets thanks for the eggs he said oh don't make too much of it is the only thing I Know how to cook\nThinkers smile showing a flash of his normal self I got on the other\nWe didn't get a chance to talk about your new place he said can I come by and see it maybe next week that'd be great\nThe great brass doors of the elevator quietly closed they were embossed with a dragon crusted shield inscribed with the motto of the Paris accord front ... place no trust in a parent's house\nDespite the fact that the ground hog had cast no shadow winter laid siege on New York for another three weeks the crocus is frozen Central Park songbirds reaching the only sensible conclusion doubled back to Brazil\nAnd as for Mr ... why the
