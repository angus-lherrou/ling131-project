bits of knowledge may come our way chapter Eighteen\nTo keep the crew and I stayed well into the night and we're rewarded accordingly just pass the ... hour musicians began arriving with instruments under their arms some of them rotated onto the stage some propped up a wall others sat at the bar making themselves available to acts of charity\nThat around one group of eight musicians including three trumpets began the biggie and\nLater as we were leaving the big negro who plays the saxophone and the ensemble intercepted me at the door I did my best to hide my surprise\nHey he said in a monastic octave but as soon as I heard his voice I knew who he was he was the saxophonist we'd seen play at the hot spot on New Year's eve\nYou're even though he said that's right Katie we haven't seen her around in a while she moved to LA\nIn nodded his head and heavy understanding as if by moving out to Los Angeles IV was somehow had over time and maybe she was that girls got an ear\nHe said

when we had frequented jazz clubs that he's insistence and she had cornered the musicians to bum cigarettes I had attributed it to her shallower impulses her desire to shed her mid western sensibility and mingle and then he grows middle yeah\nWhile all that time evil in Ross was a jazz lover of enough subtlety that the musicians missed her when she was going out of town\nI caught up with the others

do\nDickey cold down to the kitchen for a plate of tea sandwiches instead of Jim he open the bottle of self pacing white wine and does the night was unseasonably warm we took our little picnic onto his fifty square foot terrace overlooking eighty third street and entertained ourselves with a pair of binoculars\nDirectly across the street on the twentieth floor of number forty to east eighty third was stifling dinner party at which you know\nTurns making ponders toasts meanwhile on the Eighteenth floor of number forty four three children having been put to bed at quietly turned on their light bill barricades were their mattresses sees their pillows and commenced a reenactment of the street fighting in Les Miserables\nBut straight across from us in the penthouse of number forty six and obese men in the role of a Geisha was playing Steinway in a state of rapture\nThe doors to his terrorists were open and drifting over the faint sounds of Sunday night traffic we could hear the strains of his sentimental melodies blue moon pennies from heaven falling in love with love\nHe played with his eyes closed and suede back and forth passing his meeting hands one over the author and an elegant progression of octaves and emotions was hypnotized [noise]\nOh I Wish she'd play it's a lovely Dickey said west for like why\nDon't you bring this doorman I suggested and have him send up a request\nDickey put a finger in the air indicating a better idea he went inside and came out a moment later with a box of find paper pens paper clips tape a ruler at a compass dumping it on the table with an expression of unusual intent\nI picked up the compass you're kidding right he plucked the compass back from me with a bit of a huff not in the least\nHe sat down and organized his tools in a row like a ... on a surgeon straight hair he said giving me a stack of paper\nHe bit eraser of his pencil for a moment and then began to write dear sir if you would be so kind please players your interpretation of it's a lovely for is it not delight food tonight for your moon struck neighbors\nIn rapid fire we prepared twenty request just one of those things the lady was a tramp and then starting with it's a lovely sticky went to work\nRushing back his bangs he leaned forward and stuck to the point of the compass into the lower right hand corner of the water marked page it deftly inscribed an ark and with the precision of a draftsman spun the compass around with a pencil to re planting the needle point in the center of the paper in order to draw attention central circle\nWithin moments he had a series of circles and enter linking arcs laying is Ruger down he scored diagonal lines the way of ships navigator sets a course on the bridge once the blueprint was complete he began folding along the various diagonals using his fingernails to sharpen each crease satisfying ...\nAs Dicky worked the tip of his tongue pointed through his teeth informants it was probably the longest I had seen him go without talking well certainly the longest I had seen him focused on the single endeavor\nPart of the joy of Vicki was the a bonus with which he flips it for a moment to moment in topic to topic like a sparrow in a hurricane of crumbs but here he displayed an an self conscious immersion that seemed more suited to diffuse or of bombs and pretty and daring it was\nAfter all no man and his right mind would make a paper airplane with such care in order to impress a woman while he said it last holding the first plane on both bones\n[noise] but if I enjoyed watching Vicki at work I was none too confident in his aerodynamics it looked like no plane I had ever seen where the planes of the day had smooth titanium nose as rounded bellies and wings that jotted down to the fuselage like the arms of cross\nDick he's playing with a candle leverage triangle it had the nose of a possum and the tail of a peacock and wings\nLeaning a little over the balcony

arm with emotion akin to a swan extending its neck [noise] well the thing of it is\nIs streamlined triangular fuselage may not have mimic the plains of the day but it perfectly anticipated the supersonic jets the future\nThe plane shot out over eighty third street without a tremble it sailed through the air for a few seconds set a slight incline leveled and then began to drift slowly toward it's mark\nA scramble for the binoculars took me a moment to cite the plane it was drifting southward on a prevailing current\nEver so slightly it began wobble and then to send it disappeared into the shadows of a balcony on the nineteenth floor of number fifty two addresses west and three floors shy of our target\nFor ...
