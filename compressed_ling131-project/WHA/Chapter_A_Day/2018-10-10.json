that it bothers her much chapter seven\nOne night in mid may as I was crossing seventh street on my way home a woman my age came around the corner and knocked me off my heels watch where you're going\nShe said she leaned over to get a closer look what bust my ... is that you content\nWas frame but generally the plum chested City College dropout from down the hall and Mrs Martin Gales I didn't know friend that well but she seemed a good enough sort she liked to unsettled the program at the boarding house by wandering the halls without a shirt on and asking loudly if they had any extra booze\nOne night I caught her climbing through a second storey window wearing nothing but high heeled shoes and the Dodgers uniform her father was in trucking which in those days usually meant that he had run liquor in the twenties from friends vocabulary you might have suspected that she'd run a little decker in their twenties too\nHey what a lucky break she said pulling me to my feet but

in the crowd with a glance there were a few tables in the front the word empty but she shoved her way through the drinkers with a couple of excuse me ...\nIn the back there was a cluttered living room hung with grainy photos of the time on a cruise the boys who rounded up votes with Billy clubs and cash\nWithout a word friend began moving toward the opposite corner at the table nearest to coal stove three young men sat huddled over their beer one of them a tall thin red head was wearing a jumpsuit with the words but Charlie trucking stitched on the breast in a perverse feminine script\nI was beginning to get the picture\nWe approach you could hear the three of them arguing above the dam or rather you could hear one of them the belligerent one with his back\nTo his second of all he was saying to the red head either hack hack the red head smiled enjoying the tussle that's right Scott stamina no finesse no discipline\nThis moment in between the combatants shifted in his seat on easily you could tell he was congenitally unsettled by confrontation but he looked back and forth as if he couldn't afford to miss a word third of all the ... one continued he's more over rated than Joe Lewis\nTo the grand peaches what are you doing here oh grab Fran explained in disbelief damned well my friend Katie and I were to neighborhood just stopped in for a beer what are the chances said grab\nWhat are the chances [laughter] about a hundred percent well why don't you join us he said this is I think this is Johnny\nGrub pulled up a chair at his side and hapless Johnny pulled up another Hank didn't budge he looked more inclined to throw us out then the bartender head\nFran I said I think I'm mosey along oh come on Katie have a beer than what mosey together she didn't wait for an answer she went over to grub leaving me in the seat next to Hank grub port beer from a pitcher into two glasses that look like they've already been used [noise]\nYou live around here ...\nDo you mind Hank said friend were in the middle of something oh come on Hank let it go let it go where hey thank I get you think he's a hack but he's the precursor to kill ... who says Picasso says I'm Sorry I said you guys arguing about sits on\nHank looked at me silently who do you think we were arguing about I thought you were arguing about boxing us an analogy and said dismissive like Hank and grab a painters Johnny said\nFrank squirm with pleasure and gave me a wink\nBut Hank Johnny ventured cautiously don't you think those landscapes are nice I mean the green and brown ones no he said\nThere's no accounting for taste like I said to Johnny\nHank looked at me again but more carefully I couldn't tell if he was getting ready to contradict or hit me maybe he wasn't sure either before we found out grub called him in the doorway hey mark hey grab you know these guys right Johnny ... gray\nThe men nodded to each other sober like no one bothered introducing us girls\nMark sat down at a nearby table and rub joined him I barely noticed one friend followed leaving me to fend for myself\nI was too busy looking at Hank gray unwavering Henry Gray older shorter he looked just like tinker after two weeks without food in a lifetime without manners\nHave you seen his paintings Johnny said just during surreptitiously toward mark ... says there are a mess yeah is wrong about that too and said monthly whether you paint I asked\nHe considered me for a moment trying to decide whether I deserved a reply real things he said finally things of beauty still lives while I don't paint bowls of oranges if that's what you mean can't bowls of oranges be things that beauty not any more they can't\nYou reached across the table and picked up the box of lucky strikes that was sitting in front of Johnny face is a thing of beauty set the Bo told read and how it's or green concentric circles days or colors with purpose shapes what purpose\nHe took one of the cigarettes from Johnny's pack without saying please Hank painted that Johnny said pointing toward a canvas that was leaning against the coal scuffle\nYou could tell from Johnny's voice that he admired tank and not just as an artist he seemed impressed with the whole program as if Hank was carving out an important new persona for the American male [noise]\nBut it wasn't hard to see where Hank was coming from there was a new generation of painters trying to take Hemingway is a thorough so the bull ring and applied to canvas\nThen at least innocent bystanders they were gloomy arrogant brutish and most important they were on afraid of death whatever that means for a guy who spends his days in front of an easel\nI doubt Johnny had any idea how fashionable Hanks attitude was becoming or what sort of Brahmin bank account was propping up the rough indifference\nThe painting which was obviously by the same person who had painted the assembly of long sharman and tinkers apartment showed the loading dock of a butchery in the foreground were trucks parked in a row and in the background loomed large neon sign in the shape of a skier that read the tallies\nWell figurative the colors and lines of the painting had been simplified\nIn the style of Stuart Davis very much in the style of Stuart Davis gun suffered street I asked\n... said Hank a little impressed\nWhy did you decide to paint fatalities because he lives there said Johnny because I couldn't get it out of my mind corrected Hank neon signs like sirens you gotta tie yourself to the mast if you're going to paint him know what I mean not really\nI looked at the picture but I like it I said he wins ... not a declaration\nSister it's the world series on painted the world all those fruits and yours and drowsy deems that wasn't the world that was a bunch of guys wishing they were painters or the king\nWell I'm Sorry but I'm pretty sure the painters who curry favored did history paintings and portraits still lives were more personal for\nPaying stared

had been brought to the track as children and who one day would bring their children\nWith a sense of loyalty to an idea that they might only otherwise display in time of war\nThey had picnic basket and racing sheets and formed fast friendships with whomever they happened to sit\nIn the boxes above them set the owners and the company of young women into other hangers on all of the owners were rich of course but the ones who came to the run around ... weren't the blue bloods or the other times they were the men who had earned every penny\nOne silver haired magnate in a perfectly tailored sued leaned against the rail with both arms like an admiral at the helm you could just tell that for him racing horses was no idle matter wasn't money in search of\nDistraction it required all the discipline commitment and attention of running a railroad and above them all\nAbout the gamblers and the fans and the millionaires high in the thin air of the upper stands\nWhere the aged trainers the ones past their prime they sat watching the horses with the naked eye without the binoculars or stop watch is having no need for either they were measuring not just the speed of the horses not just their starter their insurance\nBut their courage and carelessness to knowing as precisely as one can what was going to happen come Saturday without it's ever occurring to them to place a bet and improve their meager law\nThe one thing for certain that Belmont was that on Wednesday at five AM there was no place for the common man\nThis was like the circles of Dante Inferno populated with men do very sins but also with a shrewd miss an devotion of the damned [noise] it was a living reminder of why no one bothers to read\nAbout all these my father hated waging he would've loved the run around\n[noise] come on ... just rub set taking your arm I see some old friends grinning with outsized pride peaches handed me her binoculars as they walked away Johnny looked up hopefully I ditched him saying I wanted a closer look at the pack\nWhen I got there I turned friends binoculars back on the silver haired admiral there were two women in his box gossiping and drinking from aluminum cups the absence of steam suggested that the cubs were filled with liquor\nOne of them offered him a sip he didn't Dana reply he turned instead to confer with the young men who held to stop watching clipboard\nYou got good taste\nI turned to find tankers godmother at my side I was surprised she'd recognize me maybe little flattered that's Jake to Russia She said he's worth about fifty million dollars self made I can introduce you if you'd like I left I think I'd be a little out of my depth [noise]\nProbably she can see it\nOr slaves were rolled up to the elbow she obviously wasn't cold made me feel self conscious about having a blanket over my shoulders\nI tried to shed it casually\nDo have a horse and the race I asked oh no but an old friend of mine owns pasteurized\nNaturally that's exciting I said actually the favorite rarely is it's long shots that are exciting but I suppose it can't hurt your bank account if you're on the favorite [noise] perhaps in general investments that need their own food and shelter don't amount to much\nTinker had implied at some point that Mrs Brandon's money had originally come from coal mines somehow that added up she had a self possession that could only be secured by the more immutable assets like land and oil and gold\nThe next door's was on the track is that I asked me why\nShe held out her hand for my binoculars her hair was directed back so there was no need to clear it from her face she lifted the binoculars to her eyes like a hunter turning the lenses directly on the horse having no problem finding a mark\nNotes jolly tar the withering source Barry owns the paper in Louisville\nShe lowered the binoculars but didn't tend them back she looked at me for a moment and hesitated the way some will went about to ask a sensitive question\nInstead she made a statement I gather that tanker into your friend or getting along how long they've been living together is it eight months now oh closer to five or\nDo disapprove oh certainly not in the Victorian sense [laughter] I have no illusions about the liberties of our times in fact if pressed I could celebrate most of them\nYou said you didn't approve or disapprove in the Victorian sense does that mean you disapprove in a different sense\nShe smiled I Need to remind myself that you work in a law firm Catherine\nAnd how did she know that I wondered\nIf I disapprove she continued after weighing the question\nIt's actually on your friends pay half I don't see any advantage to her living with tanker in my day a girl's opportunities were rather limited so the sooner she secured an eligible husband the better but today\nShe gesture toward the roaches box\nYou see that thirty year old bottle blondes next to Jay that's his fiance carry clobbered carry moved all manner of heaven and earth to get into that chair and soon she will happily overseas calorie maids and table settings and reimposed string of antique chairs at three different towns\nWhich is all well and good but if I were your age\nI wouldn't be trying to figure out how to get him to carry shoes I'd be trying to figure out how to get into Jake's\nAs jolly tar rounded the ... the next tourists was ushered from the staples we both looked down to the topic and didn't bother lifting the binoculars gentle Savage at fifty to one she said now there's your excitement\n[noise] the white flag flag day

tinker will be visiting science in London so I'll just take a room at the plaza and push them to get the work done before he's back\nA birthday without presents a business trip to London a bedroom renovation liberal use of the nominate two plural [noise] the whole picture was coming into focus here was a young girl drinking champagne in a brand new dress headed for the rainbow room\nUnder the circumstances you'd think she'd be Getty\nBut there was nothing guilty about the Guinness implies a certain element of surprise a goody girl can't tell what's happening next she senses that it might be something marvelous that it might happen at any moment and this mix of mystery in anticipation lightens her head\nBut they weren't going to be any surprises for IV no unfamiliar gambit source sly

amateurish miss\nThe insects were pinned on the felt in such a way that you could only see the top side of their wings but if you know anything about butterflies you know that the two sides of the wings can be dramatically different if the top is an open lesson blew the underside can be a brownish gray with ... spots\nA sharp contrast provides butterflies with material evolutionary advantage\nBecause when their wings are open they can attract a mate\nWhile when their wings are closed they can disappear on the trunk of a tree\nIt's a bit of a cliche to refer to someone as a chameleon a person who can change his colors from environment to environment in fact not one in a million can do that\nBut there are tens of thousands of butterflies men and women like eve with to dramatically different\nColor rings one which serves to attract and the other which serves to camouflage and which can be switched at the instant with a flip to the way is\nThe next day I got a call
