side to take a second look at this portrait of a twenty eight year old man ill shaven in a thread bear cooked twenty pounds underweight eat almost lost the blood on his cheeks and his face was visibly dirty\nBut his eyes were bright alert and train straight ahead with the slightest hint of a smile on his lips as if it was he was studying the photographer as if it was he was studying us\nStaring across three decades across a canyon of encounters looking like a visitation and looking every bit himself\nTinker gray repeated Val with vague recognition I think my brother into a gray was a banker\nYes I said that's the\nWell studied the picture more closely now showing the polite interest of the distant connection who's fallen on hard times deserves\nItself regarding how well I knew them extraordinary valid said simply and to ever so slightly he followed his brow\n[noise] by the summer the villain I had begun seeing each other we were still in our thirties and had missed a little more than a decade of each other as adult lives but that was time enough it was time enough for our whole lives to have been led and miss that\nIt was time enough as the poet said to murder and create or at least to have warranted the dropping of a question on one's plate\nBut vote counted few backward looking habits as virtues and in regards to the mysteries of by pasts as in regards to so much else he was a gentleman first\nNonetheless I made a concession he was an acquaintance of mine as well I said in my circle of friends for a time but I haven't heard his name since before the war\n... bro relaxed\nPerhaps he was comforted by the deceptive simplicity yeah these little fact he died the picture was more measure and a brief shake up the head which simultaneously gave the coincidence it's do end affirmed how unfair that depression had been\nExtraordinary he said get the more sympathetic they slip disarm undermined and gently move me\nWe spent the required minute in front of the next picture then the next and the next [noise] but now the faces were passing by like the faces of strangers is sending an opposite escalator I was barely taking them in\n[noise] seeing tankers smile\nAfter all these years I was unprepared for it made me feel sprung upon\nMaybe it was just complacency that sweet unfounded complacency of a well healed Manhattan middle age but walking through the doors of that museum I Would have testified under oath that my life had achieved a perfect equilibrium\nIt was a marriage of two minds of to metropolitan spirits tell take as gently and inescapable be towards the future\nAs paper whites tilt toward the sun\nAnd yet I found my thoughts reaching into the past\nTurning their backs on all the hard rock per affections of the hour\nThey were searching for the sweet uncertainties of a bygone year and for all its chance encounters encounters which in the moment that seems so haphazard and effervescent but which with time took on some semblance of fate\n[noise] yes my thoughts turned to tanker into eve but they turned to while as well cotton Dickey vendor while into and grand and to and to those turns of the kaleidoscope the gave color and shape to the passage of mine Nineteen thirty eight\nStanding and my husband's side I found myself intent on keeping the memories of the year to myself\nIt wasn't that any of them were so scandal is that they would have shocked vow or threatened the harmony of our marriage on the contrary if I'd share them with Val it probably would have been even more than ... to me but I didn't want to share them\nBecause I didn't want to dilute the\nAbove all else I wanted to be alone I wanted to step out of the glare of my own circumstances I wanted to go get a drink in a hotel bar or better yet took a taxi down to the village for the first time and how many years yes tanker look\nHe looked poor and hungry and without\nProspects but he looked young and vibrant too and strangely alive [noise]\nSuddenly it was as if the faces on the wall we're watching me the ghosts on the subway tired and alone were studying my face taking in those traces of compromise that give aging human features they're unique\nSense of ... and then fell surprised me let's go he said I looked up and he smiles come on we'll come back some morning when it isn't so busy okay\nIt was crowded in the middle of the gallery so we kept the periphery walking past the pictures of the faces flickered by like the faces of prisoners looking through those little square openings in maximum security cells they followed me with their gaze as if to say where do you think you're\nGoing and then just before we reached the exits or all of them stopped me in my tracks a wry smile formed on my face what does it asked about its him again\nOn the wall between two portraits of older women there was a second portrait of tinker tanker into cashmere coat\nClean shaven Chris Windsor not poking over the color of a custom made shirt Val dragged me forward by the hand until we were a foot from the picture you mean the same one from before\nYes couldn't be\nWell double back to the first portrait across the room I could see him studying the dirtier phase with care looking for distinguishing marks he came back and took up his place a foot from the man and the cashmere coat\nIncredible he said it's the very same fellow please step back from the art the security guard said we step back\nShe didn't know you'd think they were two different men entirely yes I said you're right well he certainly got back on his feet\nValves suddenly got a good mood the journey from thread bear to Kashmir restored his natural sense of optimism\nNo I said this is the earlier picture outside the other picture was after this one it was Nineteen thirty nine I pointed to the tag this was taken in Nineteen thirty eight [noise]\nYou couldn't blame valve for making the mistake was natural to assume that this was the later picture and not simply because it was hung later in the show\nIn the Nineteen thirty eight picture tanker not only looked better off he looked older to his face was folder and it had a suggestion of

fearless\nNaive valve felt embarrassed for tanker oh he said I'm Sorry he took my arm again and shook his head for tanker as for us old riches to rags he said tend to they\nKnow I said not exact like\nNew York city Nineteen sixty nine\nChapter one of the old long since it was the last night of Nineteen thirty seven with no better plans are prospects my room mate eve had drag me back to the hot spot which really named ...\nFrom a look around the club you couldn't tell that it was New Year's eve there were no hats are streamers no paper trumpets at the back of the club looming over a small emptied dance floor a jazz quartet was playing loved me and left me standards without a vocalist\nThe saxophonist more than four giant with skin is black as motor oil at a Paradise Lost his way and the labyrinth of one of his long lonely solos while the bass player a coffee and cream mulatto with a small deferential moustache was being careful not to hurt him\nBoom boom boom he went at half
