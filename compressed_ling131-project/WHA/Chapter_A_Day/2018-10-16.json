differential in age seemed to temper Dickey when Wallace asked him about his ambitions Dickey lowered his voice an octave and meant\nCool Wallace excused himself politely and Dicky led me to the bar where the others were waiting indicates absence Roberto had apparently gotten sick in the bushes prompting Helen to wonder if it wasn't time to go home\nThough we had taken the Williamsburg Bridge out

Dickie seeing his disappointment I added that I had to work tomorrow but it's Saturday not at my office citizen\nWhen I got out of the car and eleventh street he look glum we never had a chance to dance he set his tone of voice suggested this certain resignation as if through inattention and a little bad luck he missed an opportunity that might not present itself again\nI had to smile at his boy is concerned of course he was more subtle than I gave him credit for it and more pressure to I gave his forearm a reassuring squeeze goodnight Dickey\nAs I climbed out of the car you grab my wrist

you're going to feel like more\nThe gun had elaborate tooling on the barrel like a piece of Victorian silver and the stock looked as fun as the leg of a chip 'n' Dale Wallace picked up the shot gun and explain where the clay pigeon would come from and how one should try it with a beat at the end of the barrel aiming just ahead of its trajectory\nThen he raised the gun to his shoulder poll\nThe pigeon materialized from the brush and Hubbard for an instant over the surface of the pond boom [noise]\nThat this shattered and the pieces rained down over the water like the fireworks at while away\nI missed the first three pigeons but then I began to get the hang of it I hit for the next six\nIn the shooting range the sound of the Remington had seemed somehow constrained clipped confined and it got all of them knew your skin like the sound of someone biting on the plate of a knife\nBut here on the child pond a shop gun was resonant it boom in like a ship cannon and the sound lingered for a full beat it seemed to\nSupport for WPRI comes from the ... chamber of commerce announcing step Tobar fast September seven through October twenty seventh fall colors with pumpkin races food concerts and more while they're shot MSN dot org\nFelt more like an extension of yourself when the bullet from the Remington flipping through the bulls eye at the far end of the shooting range the sound seemed independent of your finger pulling the trigger\nBut when the clay pigeon shattered there was no question that you had commanded it so standing at the pope but peering down the barrel into the open air you suddenly had the power of a gun the ability to influence matter at a distance merely by meeting with your gays\nAnd the feeling didn't dissipate where the sound of the shot at lingered it permeated your limbs and sharpen your senses adding a certain self possession to your swagger or swagger yourself possession\nEither way for a minute or so it made you feel a bit like\n... ... if only someone had told me about the confidence boosting nature of guns I'd have been shooting them all my life\n[noise] dinner consisted of clubs sandwiches at six and a blue stone patio overlooking a salt marsh but for a few men scattered among the cast iron tables the patios empty was decidedly on glamorous but not without its charms\nWhether it be having anything to drink with your uh sandwiches Mr well caught the only way to was asking oh just some ice tea for me Wilbur but feel free to have a cocktail Katie iced tea sounds perfect\nThe waiter navigated the tangle of tables back to the clubhouse so do you know everyone's first name I asked\n... everyone's first name the front desk guy the gun guy the waiter is that unusual my postman comes twice a day and I don't know his name Wallace looked bashful mine's Thomas\nI've obviously got to pay more attention I suspect you pay plenty\nWhile this was absolutely polishing his spoon where there's napkin and looking around the patio [noise] he had a serene gays he put the spoon back in its proper place\nYou don't mind do you that we're having dinner here not at all\nIt's part of the fun for me\nIt's like when I was a kid we spent Christmas at our camping the Adirondacks when the Lakers frozen we'd skate all afternoon and then the caretaker and old Dublin there with service Coco from a zinc canister\nMy sisters would sit in the main room with their feet by the fire but my grandfather and I we'd sit in these big green rockers on the porch and watch the day drop of a close\nHe paused and looked out on the salt marsh pinning down a detail and his memory\nCoco was so hot that when you got outside and the cold air a skin would form and its surface it floated their shades darker than the cocoa and it would come up in a single piece at the touch with your finger\nIt gesture toward the whole patio Coco was sort of like this other rewards that you've earned yes does that seem city not to me\nSandwiches came and we ate without talking I began to understand that with Wallace there were no awkward silences he felt unusually at ease when nothing needed to be said occasionally ducks flew from over the trees and settled on the marsh where the flapping wings and outstretched feet\nOh I'm Sorry you said putting down the spoon it's an old habit actually I was just admiring your watch oh it's um and officers watch it at a black face so that at night it would be less likely to drop fire it was my father's\nWhile this was quiet for a moment when I was about to ask him a little more about his father when a tall balding gentleman came to our table\nWhile this pushback to share and stood Avery\nWolf's the gentleman said why\nHaving been introduced to me the gentleman asked if I could spare Wallace a moment then he let him do his own table where another older man waited from their demeanor is it was playing there were seeking while as his counsel\nWhen they finished talking Wallace asked a few questions and then began making observations you could tell there was no stole in his speech now either", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Chapter A Day", "city": "Madison", "day": "16"}
