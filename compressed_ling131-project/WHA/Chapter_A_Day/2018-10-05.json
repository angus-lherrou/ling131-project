Cav okay the choices but there were only ten lobster tail beef Wellington prime rib\nThe items were handwritten and the generous script of a wedding invitation there were no prices at least not on my menu I think today but she wouldn't peak back she scanned her menu Cooley and then later down\nLet's have a rounded martini she said capital said tanker\nHe raised their hand and the white jacket waiter appeared where the ... had they had all the fast talking charm of a country club con artist good evening Mr Greg good evening ladies if I may be so bold you're the best looking table in place surely you're not ready to order the weather's horrendous me I bring it up at ...\n... actually Casper we were just talking about having some martini as well of course you were that'd be take these out of your way Casper tucked the menus under an elbow and within minutes the drinks arrived\nOr rather three empty glasses arrived each had a trio of olives skate were done a PIN that was propped on the limit the glass like an or on the hall of a rowboat\nCasper placed a napkin on top of a silver shaker unraveled it good then he carefully began to poor first he filled my glass to the brim those\nOccur was so cold and pure it gave the impression of being more translucent than water\nNext T. field eaves class when he began filling tankers the flow of alcohol from the shaker slowed noticeably and then trickled for a moment it seemed as if there weren't going to be enough\nAs the car across forty ninth street we could all field if we'll slip a little beneath us the road ahead shepherd with what looked like puddles but which with this decision of rain had frozen into patches of ice\nCheck her down shifted and regained control he slowed to turn thinking perhaps that third avenue it'd be better\nAnd that is one the milk truck he had his we never even saw it\nWas coming down Park Avenue at fifty miles an hour loaded for deliveries when we celebrated it tried to stop at the ice and smashed us squarely from behind\nThe coup launched like a rocket and voted across forty seventh street into a cast iron lamppost on the median\nWhen I came to I found myself upside down pinned between the gear shift and the dash the air was cold the driver's side door was thrown open and I could see tinker lying by the curb the passenger door was closed but eve was gone\nI entangled myself and crawled from the car it hurt when I inhaled as if I had broken a rib tinker with standing now stumbling toward eve shot through the windshield she was settled on the ground\nOut of nowhere an ambulance appeared and there were two young men in white jackets with a stretcher looking like something out of a new Israel and the Spanish civil war well she's alive\nOne said to the other they hosted drawn to the stretcher her face was as raw as a cut of meat I couldn't tell myself I turned away\n[noise] tinker couldn't help himself either he fixed his eyes on the eve and wouldn't avert them until the doors of the surgery swung shocked\n\nWhen he came out of the hospital a line of taxis waited at the curb as if it was a hotel he was surprised to find it already dark you wondered what time it was the driver in the front cab nodded in his direction shook his head a woman in a fur coat came out of the hospital and jumped in the back of the taxi that he hadn't taken\nAs she closed the door she lean forward to rattle often address the woman's cab pulled away and the other cabs advanced for a moment her urgency struck him as out of place but then just because we have good reasons to rush to a hospital doesn't mean we don't have good reasons to rush away again\nHow many times that he jumped in the back of a cabin rattled off an address\nHundreds thousands would you like one\nA man had emerged from the hospital and taken opposition to a few feet to his right it was one of the surgeons the chief specialist who had performed the reconstructive surgery poised unfriendly he couldn't have been more than forty five years old it must have been in between procedures because\nIt's small quiz spotless in his hand was a cigarette thanks he said accepting the offer for the first time in years and acquaintance\nSaid once remarked that he if he ever quit smoking he'd remember the last one better than all the rest [laughter] and it was through was on the platform\nHe boarded the train to New York that was almost four years ago he put the cigarette to his lips and a hand in his pocket for his lighter but the surgeon had beaten to it thinks he said again leaning toward the flame\nOne of the nurses had mentioned to him that the surgeon had served in the war [noise] he'd been a young internist stations near the front lines in France\nYou could tell was in his bearing he looked like a man who had gained confidence through exposure to a hostile environment like the one who no longer owed anything to anyone\nThe surgeon I'd him thoughtfully when was the last time you went home\n... when was the last time I went home he thought to myself\nThe surgeon didn't wait for an answer she might not come to for another three days when she does she'll need you at your best you should go home and get some sleep I have a good meal for yourself a drink don't worry your wife's an excellent hands\nThank you you said a new taxi pulled up and took its place at the back of the line\nOn Madison there would be a line of taxis just like this one idling in front of the Carlyle on Fifth Avenue there would be another line in front of the stand hope in what city in the world were more taxis at your disposal\nAt every corner at every owning they waited so that without a change of clothes or second thoughts without a word to anyone you could be skirted the way to Harlem or Cape Horn\nThough she's not my wife\nThe surgeon took his cigarette for his mouth oh I I I'm Sorry I er nurse led me to believe we're just friends why why yes of course we were in the accident together I I

I was enjoying the book starting on page one oh four made Hemingway is prose even more energetic than usual without the early chapters all the incidents became sketches and all the dialogue innuendo\nBut ... character stood on equal footing with a central subjects in positively bludgeon them with this interested common sense the protagonists didn't fight back they seemed relieved to be
