just long enough to pluck a cocktail or a canopy from the circulating trays as music from a ... piece orchestra invisible to the naked eye drifted aimlessly toward the sound\nOur little crude climbed over the terrorists wall and followed Dickey to the bar ... it was as large as what you'd find in a nightclub with all manner of whiskey and gin and brightly colored liquor is live from below the
