convertible\nThe problem is that he had wanted to keep us to take me shooting which was pretty much a doozy no matter how long it took to get around to it\nWhen I asked him what I should where he suggested something comfortable so I dressed as I thought and Brandon would in khaki pants and a white button down shirt with sleeves rolled up I figured if it didn't work out as my gun shooting outfit\nIt could always serve as my Amelia Earhart getting lost over the Pacific never to be heard from again outfit\nHe wore a blue V. next sweater trimmed and yellow with holes in\nThe sleeves I think your hair is super he said super Saturday was that unflattering about super is not bad but I also answered a gorgeous and glamorous how about ... that's the ticket\n[noise] it was a bright summer day ended Wallace suggestion I took a pair of tend to glasses from the glove compartment I lean back and watch the sunshine dabbling the leaves over the parkway feeling like a cross between an Egyptian queen and Hollywood starlet\nHave you heard from ten current eve while assessed it was the normal sort of common ground and used by an acquaintance to fend off silence\nTell you what well is if you don't feel the need to talk about tanker and have I won't feel the need to either Wallace laughed then how will we explained knowing one another will tell people you're caught me picking your pocket on the observation deck of the Empire State building\nAlright but only if we make it you who called me\nWhile as his on club was surprisingly rundown in appearance outside there was a low Puerto Rico and slim white pillars that made it look like a sorry excuse for a southern mentioned inside the pine floors were uneven the rugs frayed and the Audubon prints slightly askew as if\nVictims of distant earthquake but like the moth eaten sweater the war an aspect of the club seem to put wall is that a relative ease\nAt a diminutive desk by a sizable trophy case sadder well groomed attendant in polo shirt and slacks\nGood afternoon Mr woke up he said we're all set for you downstairs we've laid out the Remington the coat and the Lugar but a browning automatic came in yesterday and I thought you might like to take a look at her as well terrific John things\nWhile this led me down to the seller where a series of narrow alleys were separated by white clobbered walls at the end of each LA a paper bull's eye was ...\nBeside a small table a young man was loading firearms oh that's fine Tony out to take care of it we'll see what the child pond\nYes there Mr woke up I took up a position at a respectful distance Wallace looked back and smiled why don't you come a little closer\nTony had laid out the guns with their barrels pointing in the same direction with a polished silver finishing a bone handled a revolver looked like a pretty fancy side on\nThe other guns were no nonsense gray Wallace pointed to the smaller of two rifles that's a Remington model late it's a good target rifle that so called forty five and and and that's\nA Lugar a German officers pistol my father brought it home from the war\nAnd this I picked up the big gun was so heavy it hurt my wrists just to balance it in the air [noise] that's browning it's a machine gun it's the one that Bonnie and Clyde used really it's also the gun that killed them\nI put it down gently shall we start with the Remington he suggested Yes sir Mr book we approached\nOne of the alleys a broke open the breach and loaded the rifle then he introduced me to the various parts the action and boats the barrel and muzzle the front and rear sites I must have been making a bid wielded face\nThat sounds more complicated than it is he said the Remington has only fourteen parts\nAn egg Peter has only four but I Can't figure out how that works either okay he said with a smile then watch me first you arrest the button against your shoulder the way you would a violin\nHold the Barrow with your left hand here don't grip just balance it square your feet site the target take a breath\nExhale\nI'd jumped and maybe shouted I I'm Sorry well they said I I didn't mean to start or do you I thought we were still in discussion mode Wallace left no discussion mowed it is over\nHe handed me the rifle suddenly the alley looked much longer than before as if the target was receding I felt like Alice after she drank me or eight me or whichever ingestion made her become more diminutive\nI raised a rifle as if it were a salmon and tucked into my shoulder like a watermelon while a step closer and tried to coach and effectively I'm Sorry he said it it's a little like trying to teach someone to\nTie a bow tie it's easier if I may I please\nHe pulled up the sleeves have his sweater and came up behind me he placed his right arm along my right arm is left alone my left I could feel his breath even ... at the back of my year\nIn a quiet voice as if live game was grazing at the end of the alley he gave me a few instructions and a few encourage once\nWe studied the barrel we started the target we took a breath and exhaled and when we pull the trigger I could feel his shoulder helping mine absorb the recall\nHe let me shoot Fifteen rounds the undercoat than the Lugar then we took a few turns where the browning automatic and I gave those bastards who killed Clyde Barrow something to think about around four o'clock\nBehind the club as we came into a clearing at the edge of a pond a woman my age came marching toward us she was wearing job per se and riding boots and had Sandy haired drawn back in ... she had a shotgun open at the breach hanging on the crook of her arm\nWell hello ... she said with a muckraking smile I haven't caught you on a date have I\nWallace blush to\nBetsy hoping she said to me with their hand extended more stating the fact of her existence them clearing up the matter of her name Katie content I set straightening my posture\nIs jak here Wallace asked after giving her an awkward kiss no he's in town I was just riding over at this tables and figured it was a good chance to swing by and hammer out a few keep myself and for them not all of us are born into it like you are\nWell as flushed again the bits he didn't seem to notice she turned back to me\nYou've looked like a beginner is it that ... of course but you'll have a good go of it with this old Indian and as a cracker Jack date issued anyway I'm off nice to meet you Kate see around wallet she gave while as a teasing wink and then Barrows um\nWow I said yes said while this watching her go is she an old friend\nHer brother and I have been friends since we were boys she was a bit of a hang around not anymore I suspect no said Wallace with something of a laugh [noise] not for a long time\nThe pond was about half the size of a city block and surrounded by trees patches of algae drifted here and they're like continents on the surface of the globe passing a little dog where a rowboat was tethered we follow the path to a small wouldn't pope it hidden by the trees\nTony created is exchanged few words with Wallace and then disappeared into the woods on the bench a new gun lay on his canvas case\nWhen I had looked at well as just watch it was almost to LA had agreed to cover me until our daily three o'clock with Mr Tate if I skipped dessert I still had time to taxi back and switch into a longer skirt [noise]\nWell this looks very on some new slipping as well as his chair was the horse riding gun toting bitsy hope\nWe don't have more than a minute Kate she said conspiratorial a we'd better get to it how do you know well\nI met him through tinker gray that good looking banker isn't he the one who got in the car wreck with this girl yes she's an old friend of mine actually we were all in it together Betsy looked impressed I've never been in a car wreck\nBut from the way she said it you've got this and she had been in other kinds of wrecks like an airplane or motorcycle or submarine so she continued is\nYour friend is ambitious as a girl's claim\nNo more so than most I said but she has got spunk well they'll hit her for that anyway I disliked Midler is more than cats but can I give you a tip\nShore Wally is grander than around Rushmore but he's twice the shy don't wait for him to Smoot you first and before I could speak she was halfway across the room\n\nThe next night as I was doubling myself on a for heart ... there was a knock at my door it was Wallace with a bottle of wine in one hand and a briefcase and the other he said he just had dinner with his attorney in the neighborhood an explanation that must have required rather generous definition of neighborhood\nI close the door and we shared one of Wallace is an awkward silences\nYou've got a lot of books he said it best yes it's a sickness are you seeing anyone for it I'm afraid it's untreatable\nHe put his brief case and the wind on my father's easy chair and began circling the room with a tilted head ... is this the Dewey decimal system no but it's based on similar principles and those are the British novelists the French are in the kitchen Homer Virgil and the other ethics are there by the tub\nWhile this wandered toward one of the window sills in plucked leaves of grass off of teetering stack I'd take it the transcendental lists do better in sunlight exactly do they need much water not as much as you'd think but lots of pruning\nHe pointed the volume toward a pile of books under my bed and the mushrooms the Russians are\nWallace carefully returned Whitman to his perch he wandered over to the card table encircled at the way one circles an architectural moslem who's winning not me\nWhile this took the chair opposite the dummy I picked up the bottle will you stay for a drink I asked I Love to\nThe wind was older than I was when I came back to the table he had taken up the south hand and was rearranging the cards where's the bidding I just bid for hearts did they double I pick the car\nWe sat for a minute saying nothing and he drank to the bottom of his class I sense that he was about to go I tried to think of something captivating to say [noise] by any chance he asked do you know how to play honeymoon bridge\nIt was an ingenious little game Wallace had pleaded with his grandfather on rainy days and the Adirondacks\nHere's how it works you place the shuffle deck on the table your opponent draws the top card and then has two options he can keep the card look at the second one and discard it face down or he can discard the first card and keep the second one then it's your turn\nThe too if you go back and forth on this matter until the deck is exhausted at which point you each fold Thirteen cards having discarded Thirteen\nGiving the game and unusually elegant balance between intention\nAnd chance as we played\nWe talked about ... Gable and plug that cold there about the Dodgers and the Yankees we had a lot of laughs\nAfter I Want a small slam in spades I took ... advice and lean forward to kiss him on them out but he was just about to say something and we ended up clocking our teeth when I lean back he was trying to put her hand around my shoulder and he almost fell out of his chair\nWe both set back in the left we laughed because somehow we suddenly knew exactly where we used to it ever since the visit to the hunt club a small\nUncertainty at ... between us it was a sense of chemistry that had been literally loose if a little imprecise until now\nMaybe it was because we found being in each other's company so effortless maybe it had something to do with the fact that he had clearly been in love with bits he hoped since he was a kid star crossed ... romance being the sport there than it is\nEither way we knew that our feelings for each other we're inch urgent or impassioned more prone to deception they were friendly and fund\nAnd sincere it was like the honeymoon bridge\nThe romantic interplay that we were having wasn't the real game it was a modified version of the game it was a version invented for two friends\nSo that they can get some practice and pass the time diverting way while they wait in the station for they're trained to arrive\n[noise] the what the plan that black jacket that said that\nThe book is a novel called rules of civility tolls published a paper in front of you for joining Israel tune in next time today\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]

joined us Wednesdays for the latest news out of Washington and why it matters for\nWisconsin central time weekday afternoon from three until seven\nBut Wallace\nDeserved it at least as far as I was concerned\nSo if the color of a new sweater clashed with the color of his eyes I sent it back\nIf the first four shaving soaks smelled too flowery I told the girl that bird doors to bring for and more and if the Porter how steak wasn't sick enough I stood right there at the counter and watched Mr Ottoman LA swing his cleaver until he got it right\nTaking care of someone else's life that may have been what Wallace Wilcox was running away from but I found it suited me just fine\nAnd then when our errands were done having earned it we'd cocktail at an empty hotel bar dined at a nice restaurant without a reservation and stroll backup Fifth Avenue to his apartment where we would trade novels and divvy up her she buys\nOne night and early August while having a late supper at the grove where the potted FICA swear hung with little white lights wild us observed with really that he wouldn't be home for Christmas apparently Christmas was a big holiday for the wall cuts on Christmas Eve three

recipient their relation to while this their age their character and the potential gift\nIn addition to wall is his sister's brother in law nieces and nephews\nThe list included Wallace as secretary

it\n[noise] we spend a weekend shopping then two nights before Wallace was to set sail we planned a dinner for two at his apartment so we could wrap\nAs I looked through my closet that morning my first thought was to where my ... dress [noise]\nBut somehow it didn't seem to strike the right note so I dug in the back of the closet and found a black velvet dress that I haven't worn in the century [noise] then I rummaged my sewing kit for a link the ribbon as red as a poinsettia\nWhen Wallace open the door to his apartment I Kurt said whoa whoa whoa you said\nIn the living room carols were playing on the phonograph and a bottle of champagne was read the evergreens we'd toasted saint Nick and Jack Frost and rapid returns from Boulder adventures then we sat on the carpet with scissors and the T's have tape and with about our work\nAs a well cuts were in the paper business they had access to every kind of wrapping paper on earth forest greens pattern with candy canes velvety reds with pipe smoking Santa's and slaves but the family tradition was to wrap everything in a heavy white stock that was delivered to the house by the role\nThan they dress the gifts with the

couldn't identify it\nThe mystery was solved twin with the last of the presents wrapped Wallace cut a small rectangle of paper and then took his father's black dialed watch from his wrist\n[noise] where the job completely passed into the kitchen where the air smells of slow roasted potatoes after checking the oven Wallace wrapped an apron around his waist and feared the lamb chops that I had carefully selected the day before then he removed the chops and de glaze the pan with mint jelly and cognac\nWallace I asked as he handed me might\nErica what'd you stay and fight with me\nWhen dinner was over I helped world us carry the gifts to the back country lining the hallway we're photographs of family members smiling an enviable locales there were grandparents on a dock an uncle on skis

looking for tanker yes I admitted he's here\nWhile is pointed to the left side of the photograph where our mutual friends stood alone at the outskirts of the assembly\nGive it another minute I Would

year a few freshman tried to stop but tanker was the only one Wallace remembered succeeding and from the wide smile on a second tankers face you sensed that he knew it\nWell listen I had been reasonably true to a promise of leaving ... out of our conversations but there was something nice for both of us in seeing tankers ... self at play we lingered giving the stunt it's do\nCan I ask you
