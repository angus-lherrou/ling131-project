magazine and into Manhattan high society as well\nBut everything comes at a price and hers was falling in love with tinker gray before discovering more about him\nChapter Seventeen of rules of civility\nWhen I left the plaza the doormen nodded to me without signaling a cab\nConceding that point I began walking down sixth avenue in no mood to go home I slipped into a Marlene Dietrich picture at the ambassador of the picture was an hour under way so I watched the second half and then stayed for the first\nLike most movies things looked die or at the midpoint and were heavily resolved at the end [noise] watching it my way made it seem a little turtle life\nOutside the theater I hailed a cab in order to teach the doormen a lesson retroactively as we drove down town I debated what I should get drunk on one side was home red wine white wine whiskey Jen [noise]\nLike most people in the world of Mason tape they each had their virtues and vices\nMaybe I'd leave at the chance maybe I'd blindfold myself spin around and spend the tail and the bottle just the thought of such a game lifted my spirits but when I got out of the capital Evans street who should appear but Theodore Gray\nEmerged from a doorway like a fugitive except that he was wearing a clean my shirt and the ... code that had never set eyes on the sea\nAs a quick aside let me observe that in moments of high emotion weather triggered by anger or envy humiliation or resentment if the next thing you're going to say makes you feel better than it's probably the wrong thing to say\nThis is one of the finer maxims that I've discovered in life and you can have it since it's been of no use to me hello teddy\nKatie I Need to talk to you I'm like for a date he wins catch you give me five minutes or right

with the counter was building the Empire State building sugar cubes and to Italian boys sat at the back eating steak and eggs we took the booth near the front\nWhen the waitress asked if we were ready to order tanker looked up as if he didn't understand the question\nWhy don't you bring us coffee I set\nThe waitress rolls her eyes tinker watched her walk away and then he dragged his gaze back to me as if it took an active will he had a satisfying grain as to the skin and rings under the eyes as if he hadn't been sleeping or eating well it made his clothes look borrowed\nWhich in a way I suppose there were\nI Want to explain he said was to explain you got every reason to be angry well I'm not angry but I didn't seek out my situation within\nThe first man wants to explain her situation with tanker now tinker wants to explain the situation within\nAnd as usual they were both excuses I've got a great little anecdote for you I said interrupting him you don't think it's a hoot but before I get to that let me ask you a few things he looked up with grim resignation was actually an old friend of your mother's\n[noise] no I was at Providence trust when we met the head of the bank invited me

such a celebration that she passed out in an alley\nThe cops found my name in her pocket and they picked me up to identify her [noise] but before they let us go a nice detective sat me down to the cup of coffee and tried to get us to change our ways\nBecause he thought we were prostitutes given ... scars he assumed she'd been rough up on the job\nI raised my eyebrows and toasted tinker with my coffee cup now how ironic is that\nThat's unfair is it I took a sip of coffee [noise] it didn't bother to defend himself so I barreled ahead did he know about you and and I mean\nHe shook his head one way the very definition of one like the upper ... of one way\nI think she suspected there might be another woman by the time she realized it was a ham\nI looked out the window a fire truck road to a stop at a traffic light with all the firemen standing on the runners hanging from the hawks and letters dress for a fire a boy on the corner holding his mother's hand waved at all the firemen waved back God Bless\nPlease ... it's it's over between that and me I came back from Wallace has to tell her that's why we were having lunch\nI turn back to tinker thinking out loud\nI Wonder if wall his new\nTinker wins again he just couldn't shake that wounded look it was suddenly inconceivable that he had seen so attractive\nIn retrospect he was so obviously a fiction with his mom and grounded this in his Monica ground that like that silver flask and it's leather seats which he must have topped off in his spotless kitchen with a tiny little funneled despite the fact that on every other street corner in Manhattan you can buy whiskey in a bottle that size for your pocket\nWhen you thought of Wallace and his simple gray suit giving a quiet counsel to the silver haired friends of his father tinker seemed of vaudeville performer by comparison\nI suppose we don't rely on comparison enough to tell us whom it is that we're talking to we give people the liberty fashioning themselves in the moment a span of time that it's so much more manageable stage herbal controllable than is a lifetime\nFunny I'd looked upon this encountered with such dread but now that he was here I was finding kind of interesting helpful even encourage ... he set or rather implored I I'm trying\nOver [noise] same here please don't say that hey I said cheer for the cutting them off again here's one for you ever

there what's it like he looked down his hands boy I said if your mother could only see you now\nTinker rose abruptly bang just dying to the corner of the table disturbing the tranquility of the cream and its pitcher he laid a five dollar bill by the sugar showing appropriate consideration for our waitress\nCoffee is on and I asked a staggered\nThe door like a drunk is this too far I called after him doesn't seem so bad\nI bought another five dollars on the table and got up as I walked toward the door I staggered a little too\nI looked up and down Second Avenue like a wolf that's a scape from its cage I check my watch my hands were played between the nine and the three like to do ... back to back who've counted off pieces that are about to\nTurn and fire than I was young\nOn Monday morning I was in the back of a limousine with Mason Tate on our way to interview a ground dumb and the Upper West side [noise]\nHe was in a foul mood he's still didn't have a cover story for the premier issue and every week that passed without one seemed to lower his threshold for dissatisfaction proceeding up Madison Avenue his coffee been too cold the air to warn the driver too slow\nTo make matters worse as far as tape was concerned this interview set up by the publisher was a colossal waste of time the ... upbringing was too good he said their intelligence to do her eyesight too damn to promise any skinny of interest\nSo with being asked to accompany Mr Tate on an interview is normally a compliment today it was a form of punishment I wasn't out of the dog house\nYet we turned on the fifty ninth street and silence on the steps of the plaza to the hotels of fishes captains dressed in long red coats with big brass buttons\nThis low rent introduction to small group jazz was a revelation for Dickey the improvisational nature of it was grass by him instinctively\nUnplanned disorderly I'm self conscious it was practically an extension of his personality with everything he liked about the world you could smoke to drink to it chatter to it and it didn't make you feel guilty for not giving up your full attention\nAnd the nights that followed Dickey had a gay old time and the company of a small group jazz performance and he gave me credit for it not\nAlways in public but when it mattered and off\nWe are we ever go to the moon he asked as the vibe or phone us technology applause
