story from health not far\n\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of guy negative connotation and I had\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on keep your head down learn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband\nHave kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe\nThem because I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which is bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his\nBack while I'm\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America\n[noise] and so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked my dad who are re rooting for [noise]\nJoan ... of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that\nQuestion though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just\nGoing to cause the rockets right but I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was excited to watch a PBS documentary about the economy American the Chinese experience [noise]\nPeople that I've seen three people who ever looked\nLike me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise]\nSo I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding ... signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men who would be into death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese\nWhere a Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat them to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death and so\nAll of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people\nAre now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching this documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points this green she looks ... photo and says\nThat's your family what\nI have all these questions who is he how\nIs he relayed isn't easy like a cousin of a cousin another cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this but I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask about\nA murder man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking of articles on line I find out there is a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother little each in ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nAt some moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is in the my family and she's related to me than high I have an example and my family of someone who spoke up\nTo be a ... again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know so now I'm like I have to find out who will each in it\nSo I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit\nAnd I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to ... grave we she drives us\nAnd we find ... name on a tombstone lowly tens name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone they're no longer goals\nThere right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why does means so much to me\nI go the next day to my relatives house we're eating twelve dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad was matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAsked my relatives can you help me make a family tree\nI Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on this list is slowly chiton\nSo now I Know the legion is my grandmother's sister lowly
