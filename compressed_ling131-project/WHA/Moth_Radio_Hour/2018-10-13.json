it really taught the entire family to just appreciate what we have and don't look too far into the future um and be incredibly grateful\nYou know you were telling a story about appreciating every moment of ... ... ... all the stories told him the graveyard but we're really about the [noise]\nThe graveyard as a venue to tell this story about the appreciation of large ... does it make a richer\nI I think so well number one I'm southern so you know graveyards have a huge place with our culture it's like you tell stories and graveyards you make out in graveyards and so it seemed
