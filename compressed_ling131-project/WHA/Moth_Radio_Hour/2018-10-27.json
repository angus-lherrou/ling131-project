concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate

I tried to get ready I was hollow I was ...\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel instructed up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought there's attorney thing inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look at them for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes our brave but then other times you or not\nAnd it's\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost\nIn Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um [noise] but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about bullets that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you\nSo much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters the first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later\nYes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the bullet\nThe bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt what's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what's the\nMath on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well\nI was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking into everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was rife right over there just a few feet away a cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap any graph Sufi throws my camera to\nMe it was my bullet proof vest the grass itself is throwing amateur soldiers does the soldiers are\nDown to and it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore\nTim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve is Lee without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I and I asked for my killings on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of ...
