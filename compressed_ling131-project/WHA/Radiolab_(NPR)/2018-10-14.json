Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in and uh things start produce rhythm levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little about the kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage vertical or you know three syllables per line to super skinny and twenty eight lines long and long and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize that are still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy clemen Morrow who was opposed nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote a pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she had gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in ... let's just here at first\nYeah okay it's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak it can be upset young lady\n... done ... through ... ... ... to ... ...\n... the onto the tub boost used to ... to ... to ... ... ... ... to dwell on the bone I mean young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks and you know it was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads the bone files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have a translate into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden\nDay that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to say well here's the thing he says he got this problem mommy none of them doesn't look\nThe just the guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president who says you see a piece of I ... wish you to open your doors and get out into the world in order to get out of bed eat some jam fee to say you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped hog Oh yes sir like get better here's your good health\n... to ... I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English\nMisses the whole spirit of the ... the\nTone the light hearted in us and and this is key for dug it also ... form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape on the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA B. B. C. C. D. D. and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems in ... oh and I forgot did I say three syllables per allowing you to know how yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this pump along the way even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast sea onto the tub boost you sort of like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their instead of squirming in your own bed of slurping flop in instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my for translating please\nMy sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you're a for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best tuna rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health being near my sweet dear\nSo clay laws now Douglas yeah Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the ones on jam became bread though ordered the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words\nBut the words represent concepts and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly\nTalking about bread and things that you spread it on ... just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent them home to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly\nEnough Bob French [laughter] I said hey Bob and you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health dress and fleet off with Clement who calls for\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous\nHe got the pale face in there you got the gym Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient Rome but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nStroke long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number for that's just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole road at three syllable Paul I'm uh twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming until the question for him was who could get the feel but nailed it for him he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet treat\nOne regard Otis hard recluse colleagues friends chicken D. I. decree a fine day even got his wife to do one thought away from your cage an gauge and brave flight\nSo you might flee the group that was all burnt themed hope you will to ham apple jam and French

book filled with translations of this pump\nGo ahead and read out of the best one now this is that right right no that's not the best one it is just one topic okay can we say OK okay this is also one of his but like a Twenty one he did\n... doubts those food from up some dum bum drag you down the fact that friends feel the urge bugs for\nFrom the scourge you'll emerging attract sound advice from

most of the focus of all complicated [laughter] before this one\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much is are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transactions and so what does journalists is saying is you are you just talking about this or are you doing something\nMaybe threatening you to be a who is withdrawing eight or withdrawing support in Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about this\nWe have previously calls for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and this was serious policy\nThank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry or this or this film and oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards hey man [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy and twenty she's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and I felt like some kind of cultural a guide\nMe is that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African facing serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could not just speak are you\nGoing to do yeah this is us exactly my point is going to take sanctions maybe going to be the obvious ones yeah do you feel that that question put you at risk [noise]\nMaybe who knows is that there is a job description doing good journalism in Egypt you\n[noise] like so much I think I Would give you a food from my numbers on that [noise]\nSo that conversation was about five months ago ... you know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether did he suffered for this question in any way nobody had his phone number so I can give them a call in and find out\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] and I and then it is Gregory Gregory Warner legally and good I\nLike I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nYeah I got to lighten up we are going on together with them in the Arctic shipping and that\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah\nThese messages were from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism task force will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf get\nIn on the shelf for out of the ones that are in these kinds of things\nAnd where they threatening yeah\nSome of it where you know something in their ... the orange duck quoting the going to come\nAnd get my ...\nNewspaper he founded get

group that describes the shooter referral now you'd try\nThis one a Robert Krulwich and our producer someone wheeler talked to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin was George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedians of\nI think it's about the English language\nAll saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time is one of his great subject really seem to examine these expressions and all the more interesting\nBecause he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling her I really like this one too is about how Carlin hated\nEuphemism I don't like words that hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms an American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality and Carlin was\nWonderful about things like that was about\nBoth as she calls and we know more people in this country norm are all people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these senior citizen\nAnd he was the\nReason we use the if it's just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in\nIntensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught we just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so on and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to decide something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it it does our\nReactions to it that actually have like a kind of a negative effect and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST he goes so goes it's in four different things\nIn the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battle fatigue battle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhaust [noise]\nHey we're up to eight syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as the post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blend it out the words so if you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some\nFor some interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying is that like now that his pie TST we are not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nTold me they usually you know and now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially uptown where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe said people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her so I uh [noise]\nI hardly ever notice and if people walking around me it feels like\nI can I hear the ... and and it's time to ... not ...\nBut she says when you put the device on and put those sensor on her tongue [noise] the sidewalk [noise]\nCame alive guy it was amazing like I didn't know this many people around the street at the same time as they have now they're um [noise] they're all there again but you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really soft watches it everything they stop snake soft process\nThat can move\nThere why can't I can see their last living and I can see them that gate [noise] but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see ... or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt\nGas has just say see their shadow this and every now and and I see the light pass it on them really yeah [noise]\nI've mentioned
