I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nThis case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin and this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ...\nHe's been reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up\nAnd about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up and what\nThey saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle hit a button I binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other two campers you got all four of them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle and then the men cocked\nThe gun and said listen or killed before I'll kill again [noise]\nUm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get cause someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took them into the woods near Brooke compare the two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared\nOut of their words he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had to each of them by themselves you know as he pointed out um and then the last one he tied so after you have the four people tied\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski on because the other three kids were spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nStabbed in five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened\nThree of them and their pants were able to break loose and start running Nick Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nButton demand caught one of them David Freeman she took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter about an hour the men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted then the killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and thus began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see\nThe manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the state police standing by there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a ... patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID\nA thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape served seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday do you feel at night when the people got panic when you're all well one of the doors are shorter large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left\nThe area so fast that I'm clear that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says a man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police follow her lead that he'd stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Taylor blonde spotted gal\nSaid freeze or dropping got something to that effect\nScare started running\nLow black fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but they took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put 'em in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there grilling him the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise]\nBut you wouldn't talk it's at this point that this story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things to so fascinating about this case this law professor at least ... is the conflict between what good lawyers should do and what\nIn the situation okay and we are recording so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm\nAnd Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or Renee that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is our money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York that's our money's now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well was it just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go forwards I'd like standing up for the the gun\nAnd that's partly why he became an attorney\nWhen you're fighting a cage for defending your fighting the state and terrorists\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or to head the feelings this guy is dangerous you know love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty\nSmall things wind won a schoolteacher headed self to his child he was sued the school\nAnd I talked to him out of it and then he had an automobile accident I represent 'em that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then we kept picture for\nOh molesting some younger kids two very young girls age ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped this court date and just disappeared\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes they'll do you talk to her ... her car\nAnd then we went off the back door [noise]\nTook of\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose the tails\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this may be\nAs far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February\nWith reporter Lauren McCain street and the town's supervisor of Mariah ... father says it's on a road that goes to the mind it or what is your up to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Claire skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in here so right up there so\nHere we are in our Sunday suits and Henry go trudging choose for is looking for a victory\n[noise]\nSpent hours look [noise]\nUm [noise]\nWe found this was ... well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the ... the my coffee carefully at this as good as any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe a blue sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of here who made backup that\n\nEventually ... found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where girl had said he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle where the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about\nThe bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these er\nKnow you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if if if people are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates\n... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you have yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for their client the lawyer\nIs the agent of his client only only the agent a plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a\nThere's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a wage you're building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course yes and I knew Mr ... from ... to his his du da da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from church\nJune when or if you have to be a man I'm On a few bank where she was the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now with this [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nOkay hey I'm ... I'm rubber crow which is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing\nAnd it was a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what uh what what's their next move wild so they decided to breed bird plea bargain to take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my client\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give a moon you're going to take a ...\nWell that's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client\nSo report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police the duct tape and the district attorney arm in his office and when they met army ... search the briefcase was up to be a an investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies I Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president\nCharges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar the\nBelgian our money did was write\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room\nMost of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dream food\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer to do this job\nOr ... I was a good lawyer ...\nArt everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a dead bodies case taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do [noise]\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nTo from from the moment I started thinking about this story\nI always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's been with the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes in only a my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call it the unease my daughter's boyfriend\nWas his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nIt was a total late ally the lawyer maybe he considered it to the ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months\nOf horror\nAnd [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools [laughter]\n\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professor of law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot\nOf sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain that I think the instinct is to side with the family than to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't come through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that\nIt came from words I made forty years later I'm Still I still struggle to discuss it cuts you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't know I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell what can I say she was she did receive hurt they're great pets too much sleep I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University too difficult for us and\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had that just that summer and he had a full scholarship Herbert any uh graduated just figure before and so to\nAnd I'm sure the other two children had great future ahead of them too\nAnd it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nIt's a horrible you know to be in a position\nTo let's see [noise] I mean how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what accuses the for you to protecting the person that killed her\nNo justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nBut that's the way it is [noise]\n\n\nI'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's OK\nOkay\nCan you hear the echoes of dogs down the mountain things tend to travel up the up the hill kind of bounce around", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)",
