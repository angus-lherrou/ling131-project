P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nWhere you\nListening to radio lab\nRadio prominently there'll be you and why he [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout the show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must what we've done is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with a you may want to measure went on it yeah anyway\nThe story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie newer\nWhat are you calling tasteless or the\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point so Stephanie\nIn this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook and one of the opening shot Facebook triggered a hornet's nest in what would become a loud nice but do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled these CEOs but today playing defense and now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a deeper than both of them [noise] free speech\n\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't save by like ... ... what we can see and what we can't let\nOn the Internet\nAnd Mr sack of arc I got to\nYou some jak laid prioritize or censor ...\nCongresswoman we don't [noise] think about what we're doing a censoring speech\nBut there are types of what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and die\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] [noise]\n'cause you know building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote that extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again\nKeep in mind this was in nearly two thousands seismic changes this leak and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path and ice space not if now the most visited website in the U.S they spoke head somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screen flag to to Facebook\nAnd on like meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate clinics she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then that\nContent along with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't know and you'd Google some things\nReally was just kind of an ad hoc approach was there any sort of written ...\nKind of they had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all of this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it out until [laughter]\nRise up fight for the rights that replicating\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough\nThrough Facebook so to coincide with alive protest it just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a phase of breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on the social networking website is under fire for any policy on photos of women brand new meeting their children in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the face of a bad thing\nIs not I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington\nPost so the Internet is an interesting Dr phil [noise] it was a media storm and\nEventually perhaps as a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nThere to try to talk to some of these people who for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like\n[noise] well I'm\nOn how we\nFound out pretty quickly like none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUm there's a lot of renting leaving me happening\nA lot about the good work [laughter]\nSo now I don't I Know you're working with\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named her do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just go and ... a year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct ... about ...\nWine several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to my editor ethic has\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact at that's going to have I I tell you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ... Danny\nKaye I'd just like just a case forty five thousand ... every day it was just ... oh let's just such a\nFight five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like ... um it's two ... two X. rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attack to keep okay just ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I was at the fact that the way that just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you did this\nSo that so they set 'em up at night I\nCatch myself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nThat were there a specific like ... ...\nYou know what I see it was like OK as we're exploiting those I have to walk away\nAnd I just have to I chose to real [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's classic adjusted\nUh different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleaned up you know what a job well yeah and it and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr that they are getting better automate that but yet the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of uh terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter really there will be comedians there will be jokes and readers hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back I think we should\n[noise] Hi this is Jenny calling from Lima through radio lab is supported by transfer wise and online service that less people send and receive money internationally and their border unless the countless customers Holden convert multiple currencies that anytime more transfer wise dot com and the\nShame that from Dina made a lot you can put it by target presenting theater at heart pod casting change makers and the project there Ken getting in communities nationwide future at high\nLevel on apple bought ads or whatever but Gosar found\nComing up from five to eight it's simply folk this week autumn is in full swing will bring you a musical celebration of pumpkins fall colors sizable squirrels and more\nWhen you listen to Wisconsin Public radio you're enjoying the results of membership support fifty four thousand members helped make this unique radio service possible you can learn more about WPRI and all of our programs by visiting WPRI dot org\nSupport also comes from F PC live presenting the all female folk Americana bluegrass group I'm with her friday November second at the Wisconsin union theater tickets in info are at union dot whisk dot edu\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nThree two and hey I'm ... and Robert Krulwich radiolab we're back\nWith our story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are they're just you're just tuning in this episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing because we were kids in the room might want to sit it out you know get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once they're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by\nIn ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty three strikes\nAnd Carlos Rhonda Marilyn sorry but if my aunt had him up thank you I mean how can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carlos\nMinded fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nPressure cooker bomb [noise]\nNear the finish line Boston Marathon\nAs sort of the dust begins to settle\nPeople are spring into action or just one man in a cowboy hat\nSees the spectator who who's been injured picks them up throws them in a wheelchair\nIn as they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud says there's a photographer there any snaps is [noise]\nAnd the photo shows that the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh is faces Ashton from all the debris\nAnd one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ...\nMeanwhile says CBS studio on the other side of the country the next five new I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ...\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just released the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after without\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly when\nVoters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this images reading like wildfire across their platform it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules\nAre in this photo you could see\nYou could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however have to ... says\nNo the other people are saying this as newsworthy\nEssentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receives push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on with not making those calls and there are no exceptions\nThere is either or their mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense you were like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy how\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nIn other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before\nIts way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher were but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now a news organization friends' parents\nWho are going to get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs and this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which made exactly on of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically soccer burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits on this\nLittle idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization that could change but setting that aside what\nWhat what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy ... you know give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or\nThat happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times they just reading my Twitter feed had been like you know like", "year":
