N. Y. [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise] they're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before ...\nHi [laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started again health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when I became a national\nThere was a lot of belly aching and press how many people do we think killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire miracle hasten Harris than Dumbo John learn become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way up by a broader agency it and I can tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police\nShot somebody now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness\nThat is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBurned so\nFirst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places in ... the government has been sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now this involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive thing that involve probably no less than a hundred and\nBut eventually [noise]\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of the show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times always with them right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see a\nShow a or B ... county ... Boynton Beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila photos with tons of papers in spite of costs an entire desk is a combination\nOf a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise] so he did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could get that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise]\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those ... than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database\nAnd um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations in other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level a are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence of the report that the person that's been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds any time of the shooting and in that\nCategory been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a\nWeapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to shoot that's right and this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ...\nFor their same demographics and this was out there going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it was weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very ... percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's\nBack to where we were in why we want to start this methane gas bill just moved by the single case individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know they're all written in this uh\nSupplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife a department to five five but every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed\nSri have on this table the the investigation of the deaths [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\n[noise]\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories my late\n... guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories\nUs is reaching out wherever if I told him something happened in you know here in Florida\nSay there's one called that nobody really wants to be\nFamily more than just\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or no no just wanted to know the ones and has been telling everyone about them\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this as big as this must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping rewrite right we're all just simply trying to find our way is a critical gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point I was talking to two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a\nLike a like somebody\nThat I open my windows and I just knew when I go through my house she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just had fun\n\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together and\nWent on fire [noise]\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over it and that's how\nWe see each other bad on the couch you know um air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other you know or the show's resources like therapy for us\n\nFifties let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add a touch on them prompts\nThere's when crystal let some of us over\nTo the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people have and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy crash so\nWe usually the video that is really\nMy house probably over like right now and then the\nPolice caught attained behind them was probably right here and then the officer they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are close to the garden and\nAnd all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here is all you can smell was on\nAnd so now like when you cut any like it's it's not it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm playing onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat ...\nBrings you right back here mhm\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n'cause I've tried to get Terry some of the other one that started crying\n\n\nYou don't want me to uh take some my find the best about what about following me\nA couple of women had to be their phone my\n[noise]\nIs probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face\nThree to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nI mean we we haven't been I have\nIt was a set of grace I we've brought a last week and I\nAnd I walk in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nI visit home I have to go there all the time of horror\nYeah that was Lloyd how could you not\nI Know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh and sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like it was and it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every day in a little white man we share\nEverything that I like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch every day\nI don't know if you're in the way I like going on and all of that and it's a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take his chair I Can't ...\nA number of among [noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost\nTo be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise]\nOr you can even be feel with some other Sandra Bland who I met she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael brands mother Eric Garner's mother watched\nWas loaded into the ...\nAnd it was around this time that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers the movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in D. C.\n[laughter]\n\nIt was weird because in the short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down the cop with a gun a man with a knife and a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them and [noise]\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about Sloan W.

New Jersey reading aloud to supported by progressive insurance offering its whole quota core designed to provide information available home insurance options in one place for information that progressive dot com\nHe changed central for cuts and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to show your best shot I say if you want to die I Want you want to die you can die\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can kill\nA fan of our health really want to put it\nSo easy to pick them up walk him over to the squad car put them in and the un huh\nSaid this is the thing that you guys would you use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we hit home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that women you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner who is holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to do with this thing\n\nActually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up to ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nOn biking through the neighborhood that I mentioned on the front steps waves of hatred what I meant that dared does your stupid set up a bit you and how close you tend to be in that ... being backwards medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are in them\nTo know again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nLast say primary election among the winners they told him he just ... years now Melissa ...\nCounty [noise] I Am\nWhich is the county that they told them each belongs to them and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition appreciate a and a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in somebody's principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh\nI don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make just feel like reason for hope right and that sort of thought the same way too\nBut [noise] there was this experience than I had read realized\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to [noise]\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont radiolab is supported

I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio that we had been discussing police violence and raise mostly\nMothers who gather from all over the country and we met the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things so I was thinking maybe\nMaybe yeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah just a feeling we had a but then you realize hope it's a funny difficult thing because well we'll let ... reporters taken from here\nWe are here to see the Tasha Clemens ... mother Rodney Mitchell\nSo it's actually the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center I've met four hundred other mothers who lost their children and that's actually when I first met her bed and had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because band was going to hand a ton of documents overturned Pasha on her son Romney's case shouldn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview with ... but when we got through doors [noise]\n\nShe just started sobbing [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd\nThen I just had no idea what\n[noise]\n\nBut then she had just turned the tape recorder off\nWhat was what was happening in that moment well okay so to back up so meeting somebody like a chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I I Believe but\nThe thing about a chip would um share of the police chief is that\nThey only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that it goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers have done nothing wrong it acted\nIn accordance with the law and it just so happened at forty five minutes before that and I showed up at her door she just got an email from her lawyers seem that the appeal that she'd filed against that decision I had just been rejected huh and so we sat there in ... department for a while we actually\nEven left for like an hour eventually came back\nKind of just hit reset on the whole thing [noise]\nMerging touched me some pictures of Romney's long dreads it's got a big smile next smile right white smile and we sat down at her kitchen table um okay so uh\nIf you can walk me back to the night that kind of everything everything happened shown eleventh two thousand twelve Natasha was at home nine thirty at night Rodney who is twenty three years old was a back from college you know driving a car that's when all the phone call started happening people calling saying", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "07"}
