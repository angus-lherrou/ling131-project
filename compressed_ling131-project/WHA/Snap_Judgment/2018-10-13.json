John Dickey the pro dry climate pro the freest of the brain the brain as brave to keep paying travel the world inclined hardest in most exotic\nIn two thousand north base sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale the famous yellow\nThis location on Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year so how is your name and they got a destination yes\n[noise] the climate for use to massive peaks and dangerous faces but still as their helicopter descended into the ... valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand them form up with a rock and he was terrified and it was rocking on his blog\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle and I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I'm very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled him up and he was just so happy\nAnd smiling from the area and he patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the sub shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I tried to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they pray and they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy you like to themselves president for life\nAnd\nThey're not allowed to release study their religion\nThe men were from Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained that John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was going to get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nThe captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story\nThat they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned a job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drafted to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them\nMurders somebody I very much saw\nThem as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there and there's things you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and going to jump on this guy and to fight his throat just teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker robbed and um yeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters are ... ... split on now is only two countries with guns to for climate when they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining and exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it and then five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and now I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was too\nKind of weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet as [noise]\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe\nAnd and obviously in ... he had bombed the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad in Denali [noise]\nShove pleading with him not to go\nIt's dangerous out there there's soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain\nNow it was four to one [noise]\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there's just this\nBall of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and the anger named the knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of threat especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated with each other that they was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find [noise] uh I'm\nTrying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't ... I stopped on a small ledge ... bath and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this I think I should do it\nShe just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy and just kind of came flying over the top of me and we're raising up the class and it just\nSort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all ...\nBut as I was reaching out to grab his guns drop the sense of what was going to happen and he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he has the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and his whole body let out this really horrible uh cracking sound is really loud and then he tumbled off in the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nI'm I always knew that he had medical issues and then obviously it has to brand surgeries on those British traumatic for me I think I was fourteen at the time this chance some like that\nThis is huge brother Spencer and while stewardess stiff or brittle Spencer is known by everyone in his family to be all hearts and free spirit he loves being outdoors listen to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like look ahead cranks revolving just felt like one two one two something like that you gotta you know you had that sense of joy and you're just like find out it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old spend two started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with an al formation in his brain [noise]\nYou know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now from Asians\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but ... didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when you became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never had surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nOn the scale of one and how strongly did you feel\nWas about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared of uh just\nKnocked threat coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person center would scare his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise]\nSometimes people experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nThe change is enormous\nLike there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take her picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patients who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nHe's worried that if you changed his brain you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all men are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure even if they helped me a\nLot there was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise]\nOoh expressing from my regrets about my own surgeries because I still [noise] have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every time ... time ...\nMinute fair to him the [noise] one of my biggest regrets the surgeries and my surgeries on it's made me a [noise] lot somewhat\nBetter person at times [noise]\nUm\n[noise] so can I get a little faceless optical with you there's like\n...
