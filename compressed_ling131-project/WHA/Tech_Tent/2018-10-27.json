Brussels this week Apple's Tim Cook painted a dystopian picture of his industry and code for the United states to bring in something similar to Europe's GDP oh a tough data privacy law here some of what he said\nOur own information from the every day to the deeply personal is being weaponized against us with military officials\nEveryday billions of dollars change hands and countless decisions are made on the basis of our likes just why we shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences\nThis is surveillance and these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them\nNow that was a broad welcome for what Tim Cook said and Facebook's ... echoed supportive words about your state law which just a few months ago was seen as huge the food is burdensome by American firms\nMind you Mrs ... insisted that uses were aware of the trade off between a free service and the Virgin Islands and what I didn't vote in terms of that data people consistently tell us they want a free service and that if they got to see ads to get it then they want those ads to be rather than he said\nOthers made the point that Apple's business unlike many of its rivals doesn't depend on gathering vast amounts of users' data to target them with advertising so you could say it's pretty easy for Mr cook to take a hard line on critics say\nOut of ... just ... down is Facebook's chief technology officer was quick to point out the apple doesn't get much privacy to Chinese iPhone users\nWere barred from instituting a virtual private network to get round censorship\nHe said on Twitter that the media have given Tim Cook an easy ride\nWhich I Want the media to create an incentive structure of the big news treating Chinese citizens as less deserving of privacy protections\nBecause the c._e._o. is willing to pat melts the business model of that primary competitor so quite a battle going on that uh let's see what our special guest Timothy ... who is a two bedroom festival\nDon't have the incentive unless they have clear line of sight since will launch vehicle base of electric vehicles who they know that kind of service and also there's a catch twenty two because people won't buy electric vehicles and unless they know the charging infrastructure in place\nSo that's why we think the clean Power Plan which is the two hundred million ... investment is a very good way of trying to unlock that catch twenty two\nThat's Jamie How are you with a ... a special guest that you've just been telling me that you used to be a motoring generally say you're

in the second round of the presidential election it's being attempt pasture his campaign and the key weapon has been the messaging service ... fat\nObesity investigation uncovered how political campaign has a few software that scrapes Facebook for citizens from numbers and then ultimately sends them won't send messages and asked them to ... groups\nJudy underground Yani from BBC News Brazil told me about this investigation and explain to just how important ... has become in Brazil\nLots of is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use what's up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million\nIt has become in Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happens because of how ... networks offer watts up for free without discounting the Internet data so it's it's a cheap and readily available to and how is it being abused during the present interactions\nSo we found out that there are campaigns that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then you these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can to send the message is individually about candidates or when they put people in lots of groups one market here who I spoke to was\nTold me he would put a a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate\nAnd then people would start talking but there were would be to uh people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is just a little fringe activity or is that an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd lots of has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil very big part\nUh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use lots up in Brazil and\nUh the far right candidate presidential candidates to vote for NATO or who's come pain is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook\nSupport

hasn't a written laws thinking about watts up this year until specialist in the electoral justice in Brazil a disagree between what is it legal and what is not\nWe can only say that illegal databases being used to get people's phone numbers that is legal\nThat's Judy on the ground you're only from BBC News Brazil or to ... a special guest um it's it's two years ago that we began I suppose to worry about the impact of social media on elections with the U.S presidential elections\nUm and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course it works I just keep on ... ringing the alarm bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it\nWell some of this will be learning about this coming from old and she is actually but it got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I\nThink it is and it was and to do the same problem which is how our politicians today again to get their messages across to people on campaign the way that we will socially interact now he's completely tied up with social media\nSo obviously the politicians are going to go there and then you get these questions of well why did they get the data Halladay targeting people the messages\nAre I think things have ... ... but he's having conversations if he were a political candidate he would also trying to do that\nNow in this particular case face but it does seem to be in a bit Laiki with people's time numbers\nHot but it kind they say they these are all the the question if I was suddenly being added to groups gang well who is this and and what not being added to this I think I'd be annoyed\nBut I think there's always a danger of confusing the specifics of highland messed isn't paying but across with what the message is all me if you if you think that the way that campaign to being conducted in terms of the content is a problem I think that's why you need to fight this\nAnd we've seen more ovens this week that face was not cutting well for instance in fake news being use is sort of a political weapon in the United states more examples of that during a whole saga about a caravan of migrants\nBut it's kind of impossible find any for social media because that whole model is everybody shares with everybody else we don't control the content and so if that\nSets up whose job is it going to be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem it is an easy answer that you can say that should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to police it well then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we count rate so it is a problem I didn't want answers [noise]\nWell we're going to leave you without announcing that it's a story we've covered the many times on checked and then when we come back to thanks to my special guests to measure
