use Twitter to sway public opinion around the world\nMost of the tweets came from Russia's Internet research agency which has been accused of trying to sow discord in the United states and intervene

being that the ... the Russian troll operation peak in twenty sixty even during the election and then in the tiny Seventeen but actually the highest moment was late twenty four twenty Fifteen and that's because the majority of the posts are actually in Russian and they were targeting the Russian opposition and late twenties fourteen was when that was really happening\nBut you then sore eye I presume the tactics developed\nThat's right you you could really see them learning how to use social media\n... at the stunt that complaint was really quite boring it was a lot of chefs from websites and it was a lot of studies stilted comment and then you can see that individual ... started getting more aggressive and more edgy I'm trying to be more funny and the more they did that the more they were getting audience response and they were also watching the real world I I get the feeling that they were obsessively\nWatching the news channels and so when you called big events like um the the

then some of them were pushing the message of this is why Americans need gun control\nSo they were watching for breaking news and then looking at how they could turn up the heat on the debate\nDid you get the idea that there was sort of controlling most of mine behind dates or were they were heading off in different different directions that was definitely\nSome sort of editorial control going on

well they know that small that you take off completely false impression of our clever those rebels would\nYeah I think I think you and I are around ... we'd probably see see through at that well there's a big marketing campaign behind ... and and my general expenses that said no ice shelf is you think that you know you think you just going to have a chat like we are and it's like I said\nYeah you don't get a good conversation with a ... you know\nLet's move on the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one businesses trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones ... is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see you can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and and I asked him what kind of people used it\nI guess their primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and how to improve the farmer or a bottle of disease now so we farm or we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or ... or even off line so using an SMS message\nSo that you'll technology is very simple technology it's SMS just does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty car charge it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get content people in such a simple format\nAs someone a former U.S as a question for example on on as a mess we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what if they're entitled to question where are they or did they farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question\nAnd get this bill content back to the original farmer\nNow you you go to a million members I think he just signed up a million the million member walk what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people\nYes all ... million which is as I was a great milestone for us having one ... um I mean I think that the ... biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it and even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know any contact\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin stout offering online undergraduate and graduate degrees and professional education that certificate options for adult learners you W stout dot edu slashed WNPR\nThings for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so\nI think that's probably the primary indicator would say uh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally out information that's help them save their their livelihoods wind farms through before it was an example of how it's being used uh\nSo I mean the example I I Would give is that there's a a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called called castle he kept something in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school up at dinner and you finally table\nOr on a disease was ... killed so you know roughly half of them in a space with a couple of days or any ask questions about this on we farming or get information back\nA which vaccines to you is how do I just thought the disease spreading I managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of vital you know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers that that we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny urine from we from a Mona El Salvador from ... in a special guest uh\nUh that was one of those red now public or the positive stories about social media or five years is a guy who's going to say the world at once as a positive uses we've changed totally yes to\nSanta and live in ... the year we celebrate and social media we thought it's getting to the world it enables people an authoritarian regimes to move to towards democracy to mobilize mass as\nIt was a voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activists real people are very very few\nPeople doing practical things like that yeah ...\nExactly will use social campaigns reasonable earnest about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit so it's now a battle between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them\nSo this is why we now talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but\nOf course the perfect and that gets to highlight all the time\nI I mean commercially still very important um I\n... it is connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we're getting more good than bad from it\nWe're still getting good but we are getting better now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have told you that we're getting all mean good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe ... takes over if we couldn't control let's get eight and make sure it's it's under control maybe went down no\nOne very brief word from use every climbing or you still positive about social\nMedia [laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think there's a lot of gates that comes out it's not I for one another\nThat's all we got time for
