[noise]\nGood evening high quality ... served democracy by helping voters see clear distinction\nBetween candidates they are to a game show they focus on specific not generalities policies not personalities and they demand the candidates back up their positions and promises with the fact\nThat stand the test of scrutiny that's our goal tonight and to that end we've set specific rules for the candidates to which they have agreed the order of candidates has been determined by coin toss you don't play favorites but we do expect him to keep the time\nFor the majority of the hour that means Ninety second answers to panelists questions now are candidates can see a big countdown clock and so do I\nIf they reach their Ninety second limit and continue I asked him to stop\nIf they go on I Will so note and their microphone will cease to function and we move on\nCandidates have been known to avoid giving specific answers or to change the subject if that happens we have agreed that the moderator will invoke the option to call them out on it and to give them just thirty seconds to answer the question as asked\nOur candidates have agreed not to use props and we won't either toward the ladder quarter of the hour we will ask a few quick questions have each candidates for for which they each have thirty seconds to respond and unless they directly affects their opponent there was no re bottle\nWe close with too many statements from each candidate now let's get started by welcoming them with the titles they've asked us to use senator Tammy Baldwin and is Leah Vukmir and now we'll start the questioning and we start with Ben Meyer of W. J. F. W. TV in Ryan lander\nThank you Joe good evening ms ... on Wednesday you said this week what must read in a new op ed today at real Donald Trump says Baldwin caramel demolish our promises to our seniors on [noise]\nYou listen to an op ed by President Trump that attacking Medicare for all what you're calling Baldwin care because senator balls and his co sponsored the proposal\nMedicare for all would quote this raid Medicare unquote but multiple nonpartisan fact checkers to bump that in other words the president's claims in fact the Washington Post factor which so far as to say quote almost every sentence contained misled a misleading statement or false quote\nFor example seniors will lose their benefits they'll get more ... where do you stand behind the president's office\nI stand behind the fact that the plan that senator Baldwin is supporting and I have called it Baldwin care which is a complete government takeover of health care she wants to turn the entire ship bang over to government will if you read the bill and I have\nWell dismantle Medicare Medicaid to try care program that our veterans who use it will also dismantle the Affordable CARE Act and I agree with that we should dismantle that but it also gets rid of private insurance\nAnd I think that Tammy Baldwin is okay with that I'm not\nThis this is a scary scenario to me as a nurse who has given quality care to patients throughout my entire career\nAnd Tammy Baldwin wants to put everyone on a system where doctors will be reimbursed at much lower rate\nThat means far few doctors are going to participate many will retire fewer will want to enter into the field of medicine so we'll have fewer doctors more patients that means the quality of care is going to go down\nI worked too hard to give quality care to patients in my career and I'm not going to let that happen to our seniors or to anyone in the state of Wisconsin or in our country\nBut he said that her ... response yes well first\nOf all I've read that fat check and I I agree with the premise of your question that almost every uh a line was a it was not true um but I Want to say that um\nLive both near talks a lot about her time as a nurse but I really want to focus on her voting record a as a sixteen year a politician and\nNo wonder she's worried about private insurance at every a vote a on health issues she seems to have sided more with the private insurers then she has with patients whether that's her vote\nTo deny insurance coverage for oral came out or her vote to denied deaf children cochlear implants are hearing aids or her vote to prevent insurance companies from expanding mental health coverage\nOn and on and on it's like she cares more about making sure that costs are low for insurance companies central Wisconsin patience is is really a question and a choice for the voters are we going to go backwards as Lia would have us do are we going to go forwards there's critical issues facing us right now\nIn the United States Congress the costs are too high and we have bipartisan plans to lower them\nI Believe we should have Medicare negotiate for lower prescription drug prices I think we should pass\nFair drug pricing act but we need to move forward to the eventual goal that all of this war to blind self care\nThank you move onto the next question Chris tons of\nWhen your proposal to block low cost loan coverage health insurance fail by just one vote in the Senate why should it otherwise healthy young person not be allowed to buy that type of health insurance and\nWhat should happen if a person finds out that certain things are they not covered like their prescription drugs or mental health care\nYou know many people refer to these insurance plans as junk insurance they're often not worth the paper they're written on\nThese plants do not have to cover pre existing conditions\nThey do not have to cover emergency rooms here they do not have to cover a prescription drug coverage they don't even have to cover maternity care and most of them don't now my opponent Leah Vukmir supports these plants but I fear will go back to the old days when these plans who started this\nAnd people either who as you say were healthy would enroll and find out of their time of need that they're not covered and then end up in bankruptcy court we don't want to go back to those bad old days we want to move forward and make sure that we keep\nThe guarantees in the Affordable CARE Act that said you cannot discriminate\nAgainst someone because they had a pre existing health condition and we have to keep the Affordable CARE Act in order to do that along with its other protections but having\nUm these plans that used to exist\nUm but were shrunk to only three months because what we found is that prices went up in the insurance market because sicker an older people remain there they needed the comprehensive coverage\nAnd a lot of folks who thought they'd be healthy got stuck with bankruptcy her bills when they enrolled and health insurance that didn't cover them\nBoth near your response I first want to respond to something that Senegal and just previously said and and now she wishes to cherry pick very votes that I've taken and and I have a strong track record of supporting mental health just this last session eight bills on mental health issues\nAnd so it's easy for her to grab a quick headlined by saying things like that but there are a lot of unintended consequences that happen from pieces of legislation and I keep that in mind when I look at things well let's talk about a center Baldwin's proposal and the fact that she she you know they are I\nI think that what you're proposing our restrictive and we want people to have more choices imagine senator Baldwin if you had a son or daughter and they wanted to get off your insurance\nAnd in light of the un report does your stance now change your your report as well so God gave us this\nCrater and it is our responsibility to nurture it and to care for it and that means making sure that we're taking care of our natural resources but we also have to be careful that when we go down the road of\nTrying to affect climate change and climate is changing I think everyone agrees that\nBut what we have to be careful of us when we go down this road that we balance whatever procedures and mechanisms that we're doing to try to affect the changing climate that we're not just\nDoing something without certainty that is going to make a difference that's the\nProblem with so many of these green ideas they're not based in science and they're based on a whim and there's no certainty that it's actually going to make a difference we have to balance our need for protecting this beautiful earth that was given to us\nWith the need to make sure that we're not spending money in areas that are going to make a difference and oftentimes\nThese are proposals that put a lot of onus on countries that are the only ones that follow through on it\nLike America and other countries are doing absolutely nothing and how fair is that it is not fair to wear industries I Believe we can truly take care of this if we'd balance those two needs together I'm committed to it I Know we can do it but we have to be careful that we just don't embrace\nCrazy a stream ideas that have no certain benefits to make a difference on the enjoy your time is up and now for a response senator ...\nYou um I reviewed the un climate report um it does a present very dire a concerns including a global temperature warm warming of about two point seven degrees Fahrenheit by a twenty forty\nI also see it all around me\nAh I've been twice up to a northern counties in twenty sixteen and twenty Eighteen just to survey the damage from\nA incredibly extreme rain events that have washed out roads and cost a local communities state and federal resources in order to repair on an emergency basis\nSo I see what's happening my opponent and this is where you have such a clear choice in this election my opponent not only disputes climate science\nAnd I'm learning today that she also uh is disputing some of the science behind cleaner energy sources et cetera but she also would see a\nFitting to eliminate the environmental protection agency the NPA which protects the water we drink and the air we breathe we all share that\nOn this planet and we have got to continue I to press for better stewardship and resilience he these days\nIn in addition um I I just have to say that the effect\nAnd I have to say your time's up okay we're going to respond to that because the mail you think that um I've never had that any ... if you'd like if you'd like to use that I've never met the EPA like to do that had to be closing statement you\nMade us than say a slow move onto the next question from\nA new topic is the topic of the Supreme Court [noise]\nABC Washington Post poll released yesterday shows Americans disapprove of justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court and point\nAlso fifty three percent of respondents support more investigation by Congress if the allegations of sexual misconduct allegations of perjury or justice cow [noise]\n... do you support additional investigation by Congress as a justice Kavanaugh's pass and his truthfulness accomplish [noise] you know I\nI remember the nomination of a Brett Kavanaugh and getting an opportunity to review his record\nAnd my immediate concerns were that uh the people of Wisconsin has had a fair impartial an independent voice on the Supreme Court justice um because I realized how high the stakes are that\nHanging in the um you know dependent on on uh who would be the next justice we had um a potential for the court to\nA side with polluters over a a regulation to cut 'em to keep our airplane and up to keep our water clean that we had the opportunities to potentially see the roll back in women's health and access to contraception and we had a candidate who wrote about\nSaying that a president shouldn't get a scrutiny or investigation or subpoenas\nI'm no wonder this president nominated him but I have to say\nI'm I decided ah that I couldn't cast a vote in favor of Brett Kavanaugh after my early review of his record I have seven times to the White House to meet with Brett Kavanaugh and the White House failed to make that opportunity available to me\nAnd dozens of my colleagues and I might add but as to the\nDoctor a blessing for it I found her credible and compelling and I believe her and I want all young men and women to be able to speak their truth\nI'm going to have to invoke the moderators option to ask you to address the specific question that was asked about reopening an investigation into the allegations against him both of sexual misconduct and the allegation of perjury and you have thirty seconds to respond to that specifically well specifically\nSay that I don't believe that the White House allows a full and fair investigation\nI had a chance to review the FBI report on two occasions after it came out and it was clear that they limited access to witnesses they were just a few and didn't follow a tips\nOr clues I think it's only fair that when somebody against all odds speaks out like Dr Blass they forward that there should be a thorough review\nI'll write me move on to a remote or response at least from ms ...\nNo I don't believe that the investigation should have been opened again there were seven or eight background investigations that were already done and senator Baldwin decided after forty eight hours forty eight hours after\nShe was announced it was announced that judge Kavanaugh was going to be the pick senator ... said she wasn't going to support him\nI mean this to me is unbelievable\nThe me too movement requires that we hear from the woman who's made the allegations and we give due process to the person who was\nDidn't even have the decency senator Baldwin even meet with judge Kavanaugh you had your mind made up where is the due process and that\nAnd then you come up with this excuse that you've called the White House and you tried and seven or eight times are you that ineffective as a senator that you could not get eight opportunity to meet with somebody that is going to be for you to confirm that is your job senator Baldwin it is your job as a senator\nThe Senate has advise and consent\nYou are responsible for getting that done you did not get that done I put that onus on you it's wrong\nThat is your job doing your job but we know that you haven't done your job\nIn in Washington and that's what this is all about you miss hearings you missed votes people want a representative who who is going to be there for them was going to stand up and listen and follow through on concerns you couldn't use ... up you couldn't even eat with judge high on and off I Would like to opportunity here to\nIn your in your closing statement you will have that opportunity we're going to go on with us and other question\nShe will stay on the Capitol confirmation hearings for water longer but ... testimony was ... President Trump has said that it is very scary time for young men in America there are others that its troubles in time for women with legitimate sexual\nHarassment claims who's right what's your position and how do we sure do computing cleaners and this is a question for ms ... said\nYes well thank you for that it is an important issue and that's why I Believe that the actions of senator Baldwin cheap and me too movement the me too movement is when there are serious allegations that have been corroborated and nothing was collaborated I Believe something happened\nTo the doctor for but I don't believe judge Kavanaugh was the person that that perpetrated that on\nAnd it was clear that there was nothing to corroborate that and I think this is why it's so important\nThat we have people who are willing to listen to and actually follow through on the due process but first of all one has shown us that she isn't interested in doing that you know there is a far more serious case of uh me too movement in the neighboring state of Minnesota\nThe attorney general candidate Keith Ellison and her ... not only stands with him she has it been endorsed by him or has endorsed him and here's a case where the accused person\nOr the or the woman who um has put the allegation forward has serious reports medical report showing the extent to which she was\nI strongly believe in enforcing our borders and legal immigration\nAnd I'm Sorry but it is so important it is not fair that people who have gone through a process\nA process that is a process that for years\nPeople have gone through to participate in the privilege of becoming an American now I think that there are a lot of things that we can do are farmers at hand many things that we have done here in Wisconsin to encourage people to go into different heritage reacting but it is important that we follow thirty seconds of the nation while that we're\nThank you well\nWe do have a broken immigration system and we need solutions not just political issues I had the opportunity to work with Republican and democratic colleagues in the United States Senate to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill in twenty ... unfortunately the house did not take it out\nIt dealt with border security twenty thousand new border patrol agents it dealt with agricultural visa issues like the one I'll return to in a second that in fact affect staring\nAnd it dealt with a pathway to citizenship for dreamers\nAs well as others and\nIt passed with sixty eight bipartisan votes\nWe know we can do it but we as we politicize this issue over and over again that's unfortunate [noise]\nWe lost five hundred dairy farms last year in Wisconsin where on the pace to outnumber that significantly this year there's a lot of reasons but are uncertain and unstable workforce is one of them and ... most dairy farms couldn't last a week without their workers\nOne of the things we fixed in that bill I referred to was the fact that most agricultural visa programs are for planting season and harvesting season but we know that dairy cows needs to be milked\nUh every day and every day of the year and so seasonal basis don't work that's one of the things we should fixing that I've fixed before but unfortunately my opponent won't even look at this until they build a wall and your time is up thank you\nWill move onto the next question goes to bed or let's stay on immigration let's talk specifically about the practices family separation will solve\nThe Washington Post reported yesterday the Trump Administration is actively considering a plan that could've done separate parents for children for a good family seeking asylum choice after spending twenty days in to try to stay together\nSupport for WPRI comes from Vernon memorial health care no offering sleep studies to help identify sleep apnea and other sleep disorders which may affect patient health than lifestyle V. H. dot org\nConan I this seems to be more attractive as a political issue that no one wants to get down and solve just like my opponent Trump won't talk about much else until\nHe gets his wall well I truly believe that we need comprehensive immigration reform but on this issue when we were seeing babies ah snatched from their mothers and fathers\nIt was ... for all of us to watch but imagine how harrowing for the families involved\nYou know a few years ago during the Obama administration we had a different situation also involving children we had another company children coming to our border with out their parents\nAnd I asked a lot of questions than about how we handle a crisis such as that\nHow we make sure we have a foster families or relatives that we can place with how we make sure that there's a humane conditions we don't put children in cages like this a president has done and we can't ever look at doing that again\nHas changes on asylum are despicable we are a country that welcomes immigrants and we should always be that country and we can do much better than this is the ... well it's\nInteresting to hear senator ball when talking about it how outraged she is about children being separated and we should be it's wrong but where was that outrage senator Baldwin when the same thing was happening\nUnder the Obama administration [noise] I never heard from you never heard a word never did anything but now because of this President Trump you want to go on the attack there's nothing that President Trump will do that and you will support it's obvious this is what this party is all about\nJust just delay distract do everything you can obstruct and your obstructing a process that will enforce our legal system you know I think it's very important that we have\nA wall that we build that wall that we do create a pathway for those who are here ... what you are doing though is you're just willing to let people jumped\nThe line and until we take care of our border security people will continue to take advantage of all of the things that we have in this country and you want of course with your\nComplete government takeover of health care to then have these people will be a part of the healthcare system as well where are we going to fund this\nThere is so much that you don't understand about this system and the fact that you are just so willing so willing to allow people to come across our border and you're out oftentimes jumped the line of you are on a ... ...\nGoing to move on to one last question for which you each have Ninety seconds said\nI Believe that goes to just sit at the end of the first debate you were asked three ideas to reduce gun violence in the nation misspoke marry you answered sexually that you supported the second amendment as a means of self protection and better mental health care\nSenator Baldwin you said a bump stock ban a crackdown on straw purchases and universal background checks\nMisspoke man would you support any of those ideas bump stock ban crackdown on straw purchases or universal background checks or do you have other specific ideas besides those that you mentioned\nWell thank you I Am a strong supporter of the second amendment I feel very strongly that it is something that our founding fathers foot so high up on their list that they've made it the second amendment\nAnd as such I Believe it's important that people have the ability to protect themselves\nYou know when my life was threatened that's the first time I decided to purchase a gun to protect my family and people have to be given that opportunity to do that senator evolving wants to take away those abilities she will move forward with a variety of proposals that we'll curtail our Second Amendment\nShe talks a good game she talks about being a gun owner and she talks about the fact that she supports the second amendment but then she makes fun of the n._r._a. when she's in Washington she votes for\nAn assault weapon ban the fact of the matter is yes I Believe there are things that we can do I support getting rid of the bump stock ... absolutely\nI think it's important that we also have carefully crafted red flag logs laws that look at\nThe mental health issues and we look at the reporting issues that were lost and many of these cases information vital information was not\nPassed on to law enforcement or between law enforcement as long as we do it carefully crafted where there is judicial oversight this is something that is going to go a long way towards preventing these things from happening in the future let's look at all of these cases and what actually cost the problems\nAnd said if you're trying to take away their Second Amendment rights which is what senator bowl when Israel launched from ...\nWell I'm you're correct I did propose those three I'm\nA commonsense safety measures ah and I do not believe any of them run afoul of the second amendment or I wouldn't have proposed them because indeed I Am a gun owner and I respect the second amendment\nUm but\nI Can't understand how any candidate for any level office\n... witness\nParkland and Newtown and Orlando in Oak Creek Wisconsin and not\nBe\nFeel compelled to get better solutions\nAnd I don't mean things like arming teachers I mean things like uh making sure that there are no purchases and no exchanges to the extent we can uh require that\nUh that don't get a comprehensive background investigation um I Believe that straw purchasing is one of the biggest issues that leads to um some of the\nLeft high profile shootings that we hear about 'em but yet things that are devastating a our communities and I believe it's a no brainer to get rid of bump stocks after we saw what happened in Las Vegas there's bipartisan agreement we ought to get to\nThe gym time as I say see we're going to go now to individual thirty seconds questions for which we don't have a rebuttal unless you attack each other so we're going to start with calling with your thirty second question [noise]", "show_name": "Tent Show Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
