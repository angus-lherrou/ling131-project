I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band Sicilia plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nI work both hiding in a corner or near an all [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys know where to go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school and shirts for it to you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having\nFond fond fond thoughts of my days hiding in the corner [laughter] wow we\nActually ... at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah\nDeserted in story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\nWe'd just like the opportunity when together or we didn't have to get together but I mean we didn't even have the chance at least originally\nSicilia want it to run on the homecoming court as a cane but the school administration told her that only boys can be ... and only girls can be queens\nCivilian story said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually change the rules that same day\nThey decided to have no gender the titles in the homecoming contest no canes know queens everyone on the homecoming court would just be known as quote royals\nBut that didn't make the soda and story happy\nI mean it's a step forward it another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this they think they were over\nAnd that well it shouldn't have been if ... they should have just made it so you are voting ... regardless of their church whether or not they were now that the king\nOr queen or anything between and it was up to that it was in school and we're going to take out come on circuit check out check is one couple I'm sure I'm Heather\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as el GB teach you plus since the change the sodium story happened dealing with the fall out\nOf the students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like when you ... it it was all coming to post about 'em outside Austin order hearing about it that comment on it or not a very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThat image they ... they saying that we're\nThat we're not we're snowflakes rational or special treat ball and that that is exactly what they would have expected to electing a check up or is that they are and how what kind of perfect yeah\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming\n... and it up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well like if they're going to be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next\nHi yes actually one of the teachers that has been talking to us throughout the whole issue venture off ... she was but and I can't wait till we get to Prague\nProm king queen how that turned out my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done please [noise]\nMovies to be done one of the story and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support than others don't like the outcome the votes acts and you're done yet that's going to happen next week but this story\nReally made me think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have the school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday I'm One of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older\nAnd I'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and\nI mean we could have been having this same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like they're trying to be supportive why aren't they okay with just being known as friends why why why do we need to talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and\nUh thanks so much to my guest
