Sanders\n[noise] this week we're talking about national coming out day this past Thursday October eleventh\nWe're looking at some big moment in coming out history ... coming out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas just talking to me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that history without talking about this one big\nUh she took a big big big risk and we'll her a lot\nThat Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on her ABC sitcoms [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThat's right [noise]\nI remember this year I was like\nThirteen ... and I remember I don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch [laughter] wow that make the ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter]\nOh God I remember that that old I remember\nRight right exactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody\nYou know that I I click with and obviously you didn't click with Richard has there ever been anyone you sell you click with\nAnd what was his name is [noise]\nThey both for younger much [laughter]\nI don't know I as I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen\nNo normal I mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house and picket fence you know Don cat Sunday barbecues and when I Love someone who loves me and I can build a life with just I just want to be happy\nAnd you think you can have these things with a woman\nWell society has a pretty big problem with it you know there there are a lot of people out there who think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades and run the backlash that she face was pretty up can last a show all this conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show and we see actually\nPut an adult content warning on episodes of Ellen that showed a woman kissing a woman [noise]\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and I'm so in April Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Ellen a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people of course a lot of gay people are like that\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids or you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue\nOr the only right thing to do was embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible ... wow\nWow [noise] it's so funny she says there's an agenda to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah there is a partner [laughter] the whole he\nHates kids it's okay you can try to uh it was fascinating to hear because of course what they were terrified about it it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly and can I jump and I know we're going decade by decade outdoors go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it\nI'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this\nCan impose last October eleventh is wind up here um and he sets off a brain blow flag waving firestorm really\nOf protest when he says don't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out\nIn the ... gone from Nineteen Ninety seven Ellen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do it academic they don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay\nSo for one and this is debatable\nAmerica is is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nI'm paraphrasing ... you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it they don't whereas ... head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out or no one should\nMaybe heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now\nYou know ... you think of R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and he came out but he never use the word gay might you know do you think about Jodie Foster Amos Lee kind of came out a Globes we actually have paper\nThat you know I'm just going to put out there right loud crowd right so I'm underneath your support on [noise]\nI Am a\nI already did my coming out about a thousand years ago back in the\nStone age and that was [noise]\nOpen up a trusted friends and family co workers and then gradually probably to everyone who knew her everyone's you actually\nBut now apparently I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life without press conference or fragrance at a friends I\nHave a point to like go to have a point should we be forced should anybody would be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out yeah\nAnd see this is where we go back to it being both a personal any political choice\nAnd I think the personal has to come first and I think that you don't you and I know the the list to celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know amount\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with it much like for us to did um and then for whatever reasons whether it's the ...\nUm whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know\nThey decide not to where they don't yet or they wait or whatever and I think I think there's got to be room for that too I Do I care more about whether\nPeople get in a way of social change or aged somebody is down with the struggle if they are helping the movement however they want to do it whether it's overt or covert and\nI think the choice of whether they command is up to them

Gloria and so do uh I could go on and on and all of these\nLike in that lesbians so it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on ... riots there another listener who shared a coming out story with us on a as twenty five from Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago and he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but on the has the second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my classes um my professor had brought in a trench she was a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story guys like raised to be a only strong and like you know soft and\nUm and I always felt like something was wrong but like I said it I mean like in the military and I got a wife and kids like all this stuff and and I never gave myself face to really like abstract fell centrally like think\nAbout who I Am\n[noise]\nI Would like have you back in my chair and I always did in class and [noise] um I was just kind of mine that ever another like giving yourself a space\nOr something [noise] I've never done that before interesting like POWs myself that question I was like okay well I Am I on it and like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because unlike the answer was no [noise]\n\nI recently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy on his parents got really hung up on that\nThey got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an authentic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't like it was not my body and everybody like things about their body but we still all like\nMake our way through life and we just have to learn to love ourselves and I was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body part and like I don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I kind of made it clear that like\nIt doesn't matter if you understand or not but like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and that was something that\n[noise] [noise] yeah the other night\nWe'd like Saturday Night and then as going after that and my dad called out after me and say like well again tonight and thanks for being yourself\nI mean maybe it will never really under stand in that but I'm Still their cat and um yeah I mean we still on each other\n[noise]\nThat was on a riot and limited Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Elon did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to\nLike Janelle Monday a is an example because she didn't come out as gay uh it was something much more fluid and I think we're in a moment of trans ... and gender non conforming aid that is really influenced\nAnnounced their sexuality and so it's much more ... than a I'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like well I'm not heterosexual [laughter]", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
