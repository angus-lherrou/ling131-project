is for that and in New York is there a sour back years and so it's not that you said yeah basically you know there I mean you know this the ... well I don't know if it was a ... or something but there was one that had Idaho have a nasty light as the favorite candles\n[laughter] daddy like\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy or movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up on each other\nMiserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girl private love letters from mysteriously males to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have golden spent my eyes\nTo let us around and there was this other one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her strange father\nLeft that incredibly drunk that night and I must them blacks out because [noise]\nThat's what I mean the funding\nWhat all these movies are that these were all rom com on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved before and like father have you ever watch any of those movies\nTwo out of three okay which to I watched um celebrate that left before of course so good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely I feel retro about him I feel I feel like it stokes that particular part of my heart same\nSame so these movies along with a bunch of other rom com released it on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get the scribe has to watch from any comedies on the streaming service\nThey even had a name for this big push they called it their summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that tens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this Hummer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love\nSo I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is Gwen I met she writes for the onions a bee club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having named super excited\nYet I haven't been ... out for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer and you didn't even now um they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nI on some of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer a dad as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million\nViewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching these rom coms my big question and first question about all of this was like what led Netflix no or think that rom coms\nMovie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will just might work for us\nI think they just spied a completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book clubs shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you were kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them\nYeah why have the big movie studios with movies in theaters why are they left rom coms\nWrit large I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more ... dollars back\nJamming with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like that's what it was on double up next why not\n[laughter] but then you have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and it tanked and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back and\nIt's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms on her and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars in your lovely ... end up together forever on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you've got that going on to\n'em shouldn't we expect movie studios big movie studios are put in movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because of the craziest rotations did so well because we just want a you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and in the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nAnd because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question\nI mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like we're depressed word you know we're stressed out we want escapism we want you know we want like just an easy fun movie maybe we don't even want to see things one up anymore I Know that's hard to even like out of your head around\nSupport for NPR comes from this station

A. T. S. [laughter] yeah you know and run shock from hundred percent\nAnd only ...\nWould I tell\nAnyone who would believe me what proof to have\nWhy would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just\nUm and it wasn't violet in what we think of as traditional violence so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so\nYeah that would be an honest to God that is a day of my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in the ... the the contact become more intense\nBut yeah so so people will say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on\nAny I never had sex\nAnd the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was correct um [noise] and you're touching follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taken advantage of you do see also\nLike getting close to your family at the same time I'm very much so so ah\nHe [noise] he had um a growing issue skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom oh my goodness yeah so have you in your house for a kind of wasn't from your mother\nYou knew what he was doing to you she did not\nSo how did that feel I don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of confusion and\nI\nWas so dedicated to wanting to skate\nI didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have any anything to barter I didn't have money I didn't have 'em\nAnything the only thing that he wanted for me was my ... and ... body um and um but it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me and he took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming\nAmir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something there not straight they're bent to go left and the offset\nAnd so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement Curtis is pretty steep as a kid and so I'm\nAs you're getting better the all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight Olympic trials surgical winner club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training program sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a fulltime job\nAnd a family um he and he took care of my blades and I mean our coach and he and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to skating\nFind a ride to the rank\nAnd Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think that Fifteen but he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else that could be your job because he was kind to me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts\nBrought me out to dinner I mean so things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second\nI I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns and the summer that's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute\nIt's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids you're right but so that's what was so confusing about at all\nAlso took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray\nTwo things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I wanted to go with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away and um he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm\nSo long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go down after party I going to go to anything I had to come directly home\nAnd so I told the group of friends I was going with an my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the death of going to go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured that it fine\nBut it was because he was controlling it yeah\nKnow the station ... station wagon a role in my school parking lot to pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those memories in my brain of being in my bedroom had twin beds in my bedroom and this yellow", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "28"}
