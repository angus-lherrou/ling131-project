I came in thinking you know I'm a rational amount of time goes on to great I Know that there are these ... is is the real bearing on the real physical world but actually I didn't need to bring myself to do that either\nYou know what else to to send me some facts has yesterday did yeah so I think like me and I see printed a couple of them out of\nYour mom and your brother isn't it\nYou both of his ... yeah I just wondered if you know just just to see [noise]\nInto a lot on on a street come to think of similar wishing it on somebody you know you're not you're not going to be able to actually change their lives and bring them something about thinking about it\nWhat you want to it so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to just not do that you don't have to\nI keep thinking about it is it's a very common to enrich romantic because and this is a role in national thing to do and when you do and to\nThen I shouldn't during it thanks to Sophie page ... thanks to my easily inclined to produce ... for that means trick\nNow I'm going to go on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong ... version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true still have an impact on the way we behave and to Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo where did he superstitious or a true to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process fees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being caused really related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so\nIt's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program on on those a bit of amusing about very too and um but producing those very cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was off default words like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with a bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different here is Dick which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of the lake ness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand soup\nThat there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates very quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment\nWant you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep going for the oil you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what you go full\nYou should go for the two [laughter] there is no question you're rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile I'm not going really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice the between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first intuition system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not the rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the costs of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the very do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition that I see this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one\nThat's a big cost so I'd rather avoid does not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying at\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it as a possibility Jane rise in the\nAre listening to crowd sons on the b._b._c. World Service the program the onset of your questions about life on the universe\nWe've heard from Jane about how all natural tendency human beings to seek causal connections can help us to understand the whole world that can sometimes lead to a rational or false belief is that what's happening would listen I'm also hope is also the question is\nOn come into it and says [noise] do you\nBelieve that in good or bad luck [noise]", "show_name": "In the Balance", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "14"}
