strong\nCircular storm that lives over the tropical oceans takes its energy from the warm waters of the sea and hurricanes work work steam engines the ocean as the board or and of course wind blowing around in circles turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and its hustling across the Atlantic to the east coast these storms stops thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert as tiny disturbances in the flow of whole tab that streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture as a method for that for what the scientists it's morally true\nMeteorologists always talk about how our butterfly flaps its wings Omar can make it ran in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances India cool waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car in Senegal but every four days\nAnd every one of those could turn into something\nSo you get Seventy or eighty those

hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nWe started way back when with a project called project storm fury the purpose was that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide too if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the confection from happening\nThat didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast\nTo ... when that started when people said oh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black cloud pretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coast\nAnd since then we've been improving the forecast what kind of close to you used to track heart can we use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft to collect data overland we\nWe launch radio sons bitter weather balloons and we have buoys out in the ocean\nOr we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things to help us improve of how we can monitor the hurricane unloaded they all doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives has sort of a reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep those a thunder storms and hurricanes are\nAnd you've got on the table in front of us well it looks like a sin into that you put the poster inside what is it it is a drop\nOne
