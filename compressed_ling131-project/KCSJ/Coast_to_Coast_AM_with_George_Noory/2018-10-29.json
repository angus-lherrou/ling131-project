as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man this is a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid\nSo I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a ... and and I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they'll be coming out his window areas where it\nSeems every fit and his brother comes through you know at various times and this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pay for the ... post\nAnd somebody as saying this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods or at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of the name and spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like a dog man and a defined some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nI tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them you know they said this is a ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nWhich I don't believe it said by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you call that goal that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... or is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that\nSort of pops up he's not seen again and just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was the fact\nAnd then he'd never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there\nOn the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and how the shining a yellow eyes\nBut the sort of the ... the hair and go combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like ... ... square patch\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mistreating and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witness\nDid you see them yeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm up to five books now on\nOn this phenomena foreigners in black and one of the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they step out of the Pentagon or the CIA or the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the concept in the movies like typically are described as looking ... you know go on and skins why why why\nI'm I'm able to talk about I actually have the ability to control the personal hypnotized them April even talk about when they're in close proximity to them by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when many black women and black of turned up in homes right after paper being used in wage of ... which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe based but many black mistreat each Bobby on you know just guys in a black suit walking\nI guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans in helicopters or that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a ... you know you've got a really weird and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain there is a parallel with the men in black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for the paper I think it's a very small catch a great versus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually unemployed the elections are demanding black as a means to cover their tracks in other words it might be able to think of them and know that many black role to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the legend the most have\nResumes too to threaten and quiet people who who may not want to have them talking about cases so the government might actually not know how many black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nBook or whether or not you believe the alien abductions are real the files on the lead abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the real life or documents that Nick has squeezed out of the U.S in the u._k. government that the

George finds hassle\nTrue in bathroom ...\nAll of them how to FBI falls out putting on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and say Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George fans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick\nUm Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full around his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say they strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed um I don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft with Akeley strange creatures\nAnd they subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning back to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn and they should they should become known as the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's\nIntriguing is that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce cause pulled a a process through security services there were ... they\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they the they Providence security services interviewed Ronald wild man of ... with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction law in today's world that Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO calmed down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about states\nIt's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful ... sort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then you realize that\nThese guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and when the Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts men or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George\n... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that\nSold him huge figures are gigantic numbers of books were sold 'em and I have a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about\nHow the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a dams skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with I aliens\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know um are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know which is a dangerous Roach ago\nUm but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many people showed Shiite than we've kept will be a two hour shows\nI'll tell you what network let's

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this or you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a great school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you\nKnow get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are in the study of religion or yeah we do we do get a study really cool fantastic things right I'm I'm unusual experience unusual states consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences whatever whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be a professor in and get a chance to just kind of all my interest and that's really what this book came along um\nCame out of an earlier book I was working on that look I Am a religious experience and spirituality and as you know the ... direction Hi Anthony\nOf knowledge and how it's the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about near death experiences and and the Syrian says and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remain strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still an America seem to have a lot of I guess what we call spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust\nSense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and and wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late normally George it's too late [laughter]\nYeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out look and look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat was that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions in the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for them for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going\nTo get another demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or\nIn three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there was there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this will be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter]\nAnd the the phone thing else has the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that uh the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations with cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise] uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh and more\n\nDefined were George ... speaking ... scroll down to the

book\nBy Christopher white other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions there's a character who's a explain named Jay be Priestley\nI wanted to share a quote with you because it's sort of flows from what the Robbie with singing about in that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meeting people have a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing in its place\nToo many people have come to believe that life doesn't amount to much there are several people who are profiled in the book who struggled with just the uh apparent contradiction between spirituality and science I'm ready to get into a couple of the examples and how they got through it you're just a moment on coast to coast am [noise]\nThis is Michael ... and here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage the news reports say

Ninety case yesterday dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe're back with Christopher white a Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah and his wife is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like out of it being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual intuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out\nOther ways of of being religious and many of them turned to the you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low level or worlds to reality I Am headed into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nFalls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation is he he embraces map addict and geometry as a kind of a he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nI must say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking\nBut he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these power and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see see I'm into the future he writes this I just up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get one of the things that than happened or that happened in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job where they see out to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one of the audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well off in that chapter sex um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about times let's um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what climate is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that prime flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called up a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times and the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block prior we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defending future's all those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it it's just after my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that's the kind of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nDreaming stuff he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know hinting and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed to happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we could talk about that as an additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it a that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences want to talk about say onto a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for visible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away six listen to the break you\nKnow you can get show up dates with other ... spins when you joined acoustic ...

girl\nTo those to be Ninety Days yes J. dot com or close to\n\nA crisp white so to me this in the example of flat land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab a simple as up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional hum and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and uh and habits Boca flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects than themselves into our world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah that is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have people\nWho have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices\nIn the book I'm Talking\nAbout what the meaning of these events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set up this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through\nHe went to sort of popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book I think a lot of us are sort of been fired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um uh well I mean\nHumans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example we're reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a\nRemote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity on and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and at other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believed it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there are all different all different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that isn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other uh parents came on and\nOn a ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat on what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ... and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square fighting around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle and he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every every one in ... Atlanta\nCan just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets\nPulled off of the two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flatland he can see for the first time not just line that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right let's say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle\nAnd all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he could even see inside the try like in the inside homes so I raise this as an example because\nPeople have uses the say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look down\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade when the bed we sleep in the race that we use when we wake up but we've neglected one of the more impulsive products in\nRenovations presents\nChampionship cybersecurity\nJoined secure innovations for cocktails in Congress Daily\nRoutine that old worn out toothbrush I'm Simon ... and I'm a product designer after I learned how important brushing your teeth as to overall health I worked with a dentist to\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade from the bed we sleep in to the raid that we use when we wake up but we've neglected one of the more impulsive products in the daily routine that old worn out toothbrush I'm Simon ... and I'm a product designer after I learned how important brushing your teeth to overall health I worked with dentist accreditation\nWith Justin Dr Baltimore's championship is limited reserve yours today on secure renovations Facebook page\n... toothbrush and makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable quip sensitive suddenly vibrations that a gentle on your gums and built that sort of a toothbrush that makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable quip has sensitive stomach vibrations that a gentle on your gums and a built in time and that\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan them you write for\nCall today in orange\nOptions as fast approaching zero to open up today don't waste register online it only\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHe is the school board terrifying attractions one\nLocation designed scandal\nWrestling hall of fame in museum in Stillwater, Oklahoma\nTo see the history of the world's oldest sports memorabilia champions from all levels and honor east from state chapters across the country for more information visit and W.

have faces and and people and cultures and hair styles and it's just lovely have you ever\nTried the flashing exercises\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise] and actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or selective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um\nYeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nI'm also I'm prayer will open the dimensions ah he lie show\nIn a two king six is sort of I was frightened by the Syrian Army that surrounded do to him and I shall pray to God to open the eyes of is serving the sermons eyes were opened in other words he was able to look into another dimension the\nMountains were full of horses in chariots of fire and you couldn't call him to serve in much more than that\nUh as far as other worlds if you go into Hebrew one it talks about that God created the world's and that's and the plural formed also occurs in chapter eleven so are there are dimensions out there uh the Bible talks about them as being the unseen\nAnd also there's other worlds populated with intelligent life so I mean now also um if you know you're talking a little bit about we gee boards and um the Bible tells us specifically in um the police ethics minded dead known nothing and we're not to get involved in neck romance the\nAh San says any of that it didn't work out too well with um king saw when he approached the which end or the next day he and his both\nSt John do you have a question for Chris\nOh well I'm just saying that you know you want to practice prayer is a very good form of meditation and uh we're promised an axe to Seventeen that God will open up our eyes and we'll prophesied despair will move upon\nAll ... all religions All right\nThank you I appreciate the call appreciate it we're going east or the Rockies uh dug in New Jersey I doubt\nThat morning how are you this evening [noise] good what's on your mind\nOr is it was very is there a new wave hit a practice or maybe there's something you do before you go to sleep and help you um uh out who are prepared to uh uh be able to remember these dreams or how to ah make them more loose it\nI don't know that so I don't know Christmas is a Christmas tried that has any expertise but we'll ask him\nYeah there I mean gun in his book I'm On dreams\nDoesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know say things like you know\nTalk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from so I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down I'm as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is a first for me from volcano California the caller is Brendan got good morning Brennan\nMorning\nOn your mind calling about is a sleep paralysis so I keep having episodes where I'm\nI'm I'm I'm just a little tidbit I'm suffer from insomnia so when I get on these rules but I don't sleep\nToo secular ... very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but I get on this trip we're on falling asleep and my body's falling asleep in my in my mind's awake and I guess they call it sleep paralysis but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always deems that icy and usually trying to get me and pulled me out of my body and not only that I can hear them they talk to me so I'm curious on what your thoughts are on is\nThis just hallucinate it you know my solution eighty and like ... Internet or wicked PTO will say that doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that\nDuring the state of my body is in I'm able to actually I don't want to say teleport but you know something along that lines into that it is very scary actually\nYeah yeah yeah that was all like yeah thank you and call he\nRented let's let's let's Christopher respond thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah um well he mentioned the word sleep\nParalysis and he also seem to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are with computer there there is a category of sleep relatives and there are there are things that happen when people are falling asleep waking up in the ... thing is Gary ... is a very common you know people wake up and they can't move um [noise]\nYou know I can I think I Believe it can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so\nYou know uh get the question is you know is is merely a a physiological biological hum issue or a problem um or is it somehow opening spiritual world\nI guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is you know these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but\nUm it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of this virtual reality um maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have vision um\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a sort of aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think that rules out the possibility that you know their particular use your brain chemistry\nAs it off or you know and it was white thank you very much appreciate it I enjoyed the book it's called other worlds I Hope people will check it out thanks also to him earlier guest Nick Redfern and we've got his links a\nHost of on the coast to coast website and thanks to my colleagues there at coast a Michael cos yo and Donald Walker ...

and breadth and sheer number of different strange in one Bruce and scary being the kind of things that you cover in this book monsters do you use your germ\nCan't help but wonder uh you know are we humans completely off our rockers to see so many things for so long so many of them that seemingly don't exist can't exist or is there some kind of a common read or seen the ties all these things together\nWell I guess the one thing more than anything else that ties whether it's like monsters big for it's a muffin man you name it the yeah the I guess the one thing more than anything else that puts them in the same categories that federal one hundred percent elusive one hundred percent of the time now of course\nSkeptics would say well that's because they don't exist um but I have to admit you know the thing that that wanna angle that kind of ties or the so called monsters together is the fact that they are elusive and I'm\nIn some cases I think you know if you're dealing with things like like monsters that can be quite understandably feel daily way the\nYou know a forty mile long like can you know seven hundred I faith\nA tape um most of us don't have the money to hire a mini submarine you know to go looking for these things so that that's one of the problems we have is that um\nYou know the just the logistics of trying to find some of these things can be quite difficult particularly so when they the scientific community and the zoological community\nYour turn their heads away from these kind of phenomena so um you know that can be problematic but um I always tell people I mean if you look back in history [noise]\nUm you know it's only been a couple of centuries 'em\nBefore a lot of recognized animals where was found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that it's um you know there are surprised he's still out as much of the the world which still remains under explored\nYeah you have several of the creatures your monsters that are in your book they're based on things that we know existed at one point you don't even beepers for example or you know some of these things that look like dinosaurs that are believed long

sort of pseudo science but a ... like you followed his\nYeah yes exactly but what I Would say is that you know when you're when you're looking at all these different things you know you mentioned creatures that um we're ... we're ... things may not be I mean that relates to big votes on the bottom level snowman for example one of the more intriguing theories\nIs that they say of the Himalayas

lizard man I remember reporting blizzard man as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding in seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details [noise]\nOh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well I think it's a large area for ...\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for paranormal phenomena the kind of ... just the same you know that'd be coming out his window areas where it seemed to everything in each brother comes through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pipe for the ... post\nAnd somebody saying this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or ... would be a better term to use the words are at high speed you know kind of like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of point classrooms\nIn the sixties or with them off or something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the ... one of the name and spoke to the local police or I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut

us\n[noise] well yeah the ... the ... is really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that's where I'm you know something pops up and people are like what was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in ... Washington and I'm actually quite close to ...\nOn the witness a minute I'm young man named Brian Khan failed I'm a solo these strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with a large wings um you know the the the Harry Potter and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he caught it looks up at like ...\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black stories you and I've talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black up trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign demand in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA or the FBI on and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies back typically are described as looking ... you know go on and a skinny white white white\nUm [noise] um people talk about how like St ... mind control the personal hypnotized them paper they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after pay for pain using wage of boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X. files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe ... but many black mistreat it fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know I'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a ... you know you've got a really we won the next play a couple and then some which ah Asia apps to explain there is a parallel with the ... black where\nNo doubt that in some cases I think that government agencies are responsible for the day but I think it's a very small catch gray versus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was what I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually unemployed the elections are demanding black as a means to cover their tracks in other words it might be paid for with the government to know that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most have\nResumes too to threaten and quiet papal who who've I may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files with the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book\nOr whether or not you believe the alien abductions are real the files

from Harvard University where he studied religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality and on church religion new religious movements electronic media and popular culture and there's currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds\nSpirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finish this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] give me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences whatever whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of the privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of problem my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh\nOf course as a as somebody who studies of religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that uh that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still an America seem to have a lot of I\nGuess would be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America I'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real\nSense of relief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so if I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multiverse are thinking about higher dimension I think all of these and half the scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and the Braves with ... with offensive on mystery and and wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and I um and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time relating normally Georgia\n[laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you've sort of reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these\nCrazy things but also to science right\nYeah and I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for\nThem for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to have a\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or she'll dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um since Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and wet and then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and height\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nOr in this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter]\nAnd that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations with cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even that's six Seventeen and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the audience of her string theory but\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild fought but but the square character did have these wild often and I even have the stationary experience right where he thought that that was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise] you know think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration I some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through trials in turmoil so in trying to get their head

and feeling that they can no longer or an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and [noise] he was mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimensions has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted incomes an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nDoes this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make All right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAble to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see see I'm into the future and you write these ideas have been a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know like sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that can happen a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one side of the audio what how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well also in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time it was which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experienced time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our descendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this\nKind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of the questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYou're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on\nSo and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did hum and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more possible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self it somehow lifted itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should their ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nDreaming stuff he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last or is there um that's what he believed happening among others the dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as a as additional facial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that he thought and he got everybody everybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that every one if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believe that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about the science is a sharman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so

S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday\nThat's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if you're talking about tens of millions of packages I'm\nYou know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when the uh you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about this is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts in so [noise] you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this or you know without\nA some sort of specific reason\nI'm obviously you know I'm sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing um but you\nKnow the good news is any package that's put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's awesome and ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming you get a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seem like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that that technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up and these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail to the\nPost postal service and so um you know the public service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through but the problem is ultimately tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with\nUm then you know there's just a value is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mentally I'm you know the last and last line of defense or those you know the people in the mail room

journal reporter Joshua ... and Joshua what do we have\nWell basically what you've got as you got\nA mixture of factors that are playing a lot of races around the country I'm the chief from being at the Republican incumbent in the district there is retiring [noise] um and so you've got a battle between a long time Republican in the state law or almost became a governor a few years ago and a brand new political candidate for time\nA candidate who is a pediatrician from the area\nAnd it's we're seeing a play on districts across the country where the suburban\nWomen voters who are educated at risk of losing and but the thing about this district which occur outside of Seattle is\nIs that ... going to lose those voters at a faster clip than um district was recently redrawn and faster than the rural voters can keep up with a Republican I'm so there is a\nBit of that but also the Republicans in the suburbs I'm voting for Barbara updates like heart before and if they will keep\nThem in the fold then that's where the Democrats have a problem in this district\n... let me come above polling indicated helping\nOut there's internal polling on both sides that show with ... so both sides are convinced that it's going to come down to turn out and you see that playing out across the country where um it's really about who can mobilize the voters that most\nAnd we're seeing in polls that a national polls that cuts are more energized than Republicans um and that's kind of trend off like all\nRight so uh the Democrat who's running your who's the pediatrician that's uh this is Kim Schrier\nController okay so her she's been really hitting hard on healthcare stuff\nThat's right I mean she using that as a direct appeal to people who are nervous about their health care costs that seeing their costs to go up and\nAh who have pre existing conditions I'm and she feels from directly as a pediatrician in their community\nUm she's got a thousand or patients that are in that district um ship you some after type ... diabetic herself as someone who has a preexisting condition [noise] um and he's got his power for pledged to support that provision of Obamacare\nBut it's a very direct appeal um that Democrats in Washington state and in the capital believe make her buried a compelling candidate\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal reporter Joshua ... and his piece is called outside

abhorrent feels that he can actually be\nOn message on this and he has tried to be and that is number one thing I Want canvassing with some of his tears and that is the thing that they\nPush that on his fires that has a stump speeches um and the the\nThe power of this district is will that be enough to keep 'em some of these Republicans in the fold or will they reflect to send a check on Donald Trump to wash\nCars this is a long held Republican district\nHas was drawn in the Nineteen eighties after the sense of um in Nineteen eighty and it has never sent the Democrat to Washington or um but even though it has that can ... congressional races tend to vote Democrat for president Hillary Clinton the Donald Trump there by about three\nAnd a mistrial or you said is getting support actually from Seattle or should not have voters right\nRight it's really interesting I was trying I was out there and I was trying to talk to people I live in a person who lived in a district and they kept telling me they were from Seattle and that's common um you see that in other races where people um even sometimes cross state lines forget it to get into it because they volunteer money\nI'm so this is just another example of that where people in Seattle you know their districts are reliably democratic and if they want to be a part of the blue wave of what they think will be a blue wave I keep hearing about it on TV and the closest way they can get ... to go to the swing\nDistrict which is the only pops up or if I'm right by a cookbook report in Washington state so there's a lot of the
