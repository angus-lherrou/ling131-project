under the at camp [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd\nIf we can when you were in DC we're in the swamp the sewer Kaylee ...\nAnd ... with us but I don't understand there's a well I Know there are consequences ... because I Know Richard ... lawyer at the time of really good guy by the name of Lin wood\nUh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job uh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason we use the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job pointing out the hypocrisy here\nUh I mean if we're if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs in high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent\nMembers of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss uh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term\nBecause every Democrat I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like what Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and where it's just no play gonna vote\nEt cetera and it comes down to three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing for a look at a hearing Grassley knock on the Internet and I began the crap you're exactly right it can make it a week ago we would have had like Howard park how young are showing I think he can hear\nThat we might not next heroin you and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat but because they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at it gate or\nFive thirty percent margin people want to see an confirmed I very good margin people North Dakota\nOnce the cat and knock at first it would be political suicide or high camp or match or don't you're not vote for the nominee don't ever get people to get there in our last dog but they might get out of their own political okay\nWell that's exactly right well I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski inflate\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic\nLeadership gives them a flying hook about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana and Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the euro with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again I mean I was a horrible mission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah I mean [noise] the\nReal goes wrong principle it was a man that stands on the values\nThe man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's are conscious of the conservative and if you know if he is a real moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just I mean the first to tell Jeff like Jeff delusion [laughter] you are to lose you know you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime I got it right the thank you both for being with us he couldn't get any teen votes\nI I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state racing off to the north east New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI I mean so out of touch in and out and nobody's interested in the guy that says oh I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again also every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were involved in a particular vote\nRight quick or break we'll come back coming up we're

a possible hurricane this week I neon Fox News tropical storm Michael currently in the Caribbean is strengthening and is expected to be a hurricane by Monday Night or Tuesday Fox meteorologist Adam clots\nContinues intensifying you notice here as the winds will increase from currently set as a tropical storm our forecasts rounded up to a category one or a category to store\nAnd I fortress that will go big step toward turning the Trump presidency into an imperial presidency a permanent residency far less check and balance like congressman the judicial system the census cases not the only case extending the imperial power as the presidency\nOn the Supreme Court docket of our cases there's also gamble versus the United states\nLike here's what gamble versus the United states is about\nThe president hurdles you you can still be prosecuted by the states the president's part and there's only a partner for federal offensive if the president prepares you for federal that you could still be nailed by a state court\nCampbell versus the United states could count the sort of multiple prosecution of double jeopardy and make it illegal so the gamble case could Rana ... the president currently does not have the power to ran an absolute Oregon a burglar bars federal and state level\nJust extended earning power could be very useful with\nMembers of the Trump team like Paul Manafort or Michael Cohen and if the president\nDecides to work with him itself it could protect you know for prosecutions for the tax Dodgers associated with the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in New York Times reporter about to this day the Trump received under the table from his father\nMany Democrats are that are just cornered pardoning himself this is exactly what Trump will do and if he's challenged she has the court system is favor like two judges ... him a favor Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh\nThe big question is how we're how will they react and how would they vote and uh I don't know I I tend to think that they will follow the path of the law but we shall see now is Dr John Curtis\nMine columnist dot com John is with us no\nI don't think he is and we and we wanted to get John's reaction to the Neal cap on the situation but we did not let the is go on with some other news stories while we can tropical storm Michael for near the Yucatan Peninsula on Sunday and it's on track the wall up the United\nStates it could hit us as a hurricane\nWell once again nature has built the deadly blow to Haiti at least twelve people were killed in a hundred and eighty eight

explosive according to a new study you know the study doesn't assured that one's risk of contracting the flu varies depending on the size of any given community rather it argues that and less populous places\nThe flu needs the right atmospheric conditions to spread more effectively let's chalk and check in with Dr Gary right now we're hearing what about the flu season this year what do you think\nOr the flu season this year you and I am and discussing the flu for six years now and it gets even more confusing or the big flu virus now is called age three and two and the ... it's the big hitter especially on the the elderly but George\nThe numbers fly all over the place so the CDC is scaring us that a hundred and Seventy five children died last year but fifty percent of those had preexisting conditions\n... look on the flip side twelve thousand children died in accidents like cars fires and so forth the confusion gets even worse when um the vaccine last year it was only thirty four percent effective and now they've come out with a loving flu vaccines on the market\nAnd the CDC has picked up the shop gun and fired away when too many hey use\nAny one of these vaccines I don't like that do you oh no not at all because your\nDrugstore may be offering a vaccine would should be the cheapest one they can get a hold of that is true\nThere is no ... no I'm One vaccine for everybody the nasal spray is back again after being denied for two years by the CDC and my confusion and it's you know as a doctor is I have to tell my patrons the risks and let them decide ... because\nI'm I'm not a you know I can push the the like this but you know the Cleveland Browns one today and maybe I'll get on a shot and get lucky\nYou never know thanks Gary Dr John Curtis online columnist dot com is back with us for his reaction on the Brett Kavanaugh's appointments go ahead John\nWell you know you know the most interesting thing about this is how the Democrats pushed and pushed and finally light perpetually that\nYou know for an FBI probe but guess what George have there been no FBI probe Susan Collins probably would have voted now and so it's quite right so the Democrats kind of a you know have this went on their own had even though Cory Booker today calling for the impeachment of cabinet\nAnd they're now they're calling for that you give the guy a chance now that he's in for crying out\nLoud yeah I mean but again he's preaching to the choir in Iowa you know is central uh twenty twenty presidential candidate\nI think one of the things that they tried to turn this into was that we want to really investigate is drinking behavior in high school and in college and this is where they think that they have an an impeachable offense where nobody interested\nIn his drinking behavior they were making an allegation of sexual assault if there was no corroborating evidence even among the witness chi name then this is over and Susan Collins is very uh it was and comprehensive\nExplanation why she voted for him because if the presumptive the presumption of innocence and our constitution gr innocent until proven guilty they have no proof\nWill this pass John\n[noise] no it won't ... this particular issue all house but the bitterness and the rancor between the two party system will not pass you know looking at a government that is at loggerheads there's almost nothing and which they can agree and I think that we we really have to\nBegin to rethink the two party system or certainly watching grind to a halt like this and he at

works in UFOs and you will you stumbled into a time warp for several months ago did you\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast\nAm shooting them before I even did it [laughter]\nAnd I know that that that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology are going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that plays turned out to the area fifty\n... Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um\nI I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly\nLas Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance\nAnd say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to\nBe safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about\nTalk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here and in slave us it might be a better fate\nFor us to commit to global suicide in other words\nAgain I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knew something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and\nUm you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep I\nMean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but\nThere may be some some ah beings that we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps present thing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's

Nineteen years I had an uncle had passed away and they were having a little little showbiz pointed at church\nAnd I wasn't that close to him but I just said yeah anyway I uh I went I was late getting as so I had sit back and services going on and I was I\nFelt some somebody standing behind me behind one of the push you a check and I looked up anyway\n... they just passed away and and he\nTold me he said John that your car and I was shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when I was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone but still you know I knew something\nAnd so I got her at a friend of mine in the next morning I call my cousin which was the so and it has to wait and asked him if he didn't learn when you're not clear to me and I get him right back home he said not at all\nSo he and his belt and get my car and too many keys flown that anyway he\nGot in my car they pull that the ... fault line and they were hit by a truck and they they weren't killed but they were extremely you know you could I mean they had ... votes in mind that too but I never told me like this and\nThat was really a lot to say anything that it was a dead till two of my close friends and I'm\nOut of the leg right now I'm not that I was sure they have the\nI guess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know what I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat the end you get my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a ... that's the only time I ever had to think like a safe steroids ghost capitals anything and so does that mean they're seeing\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientists who are the smartest folks among us right now who are are you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are a spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the\nPresidents and so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an apt to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms\nThat are coming that the aunt can't see that the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover\nMight definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and ... and this is very funny because he still doesn't order\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and ah I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking them out and gets article IV releasing their pent up frustrations on him and\nIt was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this call here and you know he\nWas fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that\nUm he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and almost ten years ago and to do live reports and to really dig into this and I you may or may not recall George I actually called into the show\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise] if you if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain life dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct of bunch of paranormal activity that spins off\nSo you get more ghostly encounter is people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kinda stuff but\nIn its role as form it's almost like Meridian Z on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare to the ... of energy that flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and ... ... in certain angles at certain cliffs it\nCan create what similar to to ball lightening and so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white are just\nMerely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua ...

I couldn't seem directly straight you know just I ... I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start mop and they continue mop like okay this is kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit you really show theirselves\nOr and he wasn't supposed to be there was he\nI I don't think so I talked to the CNA in a couple of the nurses and they told me that\nThey everyone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone's watching them and I'm just wondering like huh Josh or what do you guys think 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full knew I could tell you what it it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf Illinois in ... where do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to what I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have a colder\nDrier environment and I know that certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to material\nFive and interact or in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electromagnetic charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold when what they call it an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro steady charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm\nAnd it reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect\nBut then the third and final point of course is that this time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and\nCertainly it means that again at least here in the United states this is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nJosh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially at Ashville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery of the ah last calling me and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating foul and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited it I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your uh been again one more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no period

and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard shirt pocket\nAnd about some haunted rock and roll that was a classic man welcome back to the program\nThank you very much thanks for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\nWell the simple answer was I was born that\nWay on Halloween or yay yay happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't\nInterested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter and uh every Halloween I Would try to write a\nA a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it kicking off the urine live this quarter October November December it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I've found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple go stories with\nTales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and the vents from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to a regular guy\nThat that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll go stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what\nI found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower um and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and World War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep\nSeriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect into history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nOr you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went to the little big corn oh we're custard less than was\nAnd you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was wanted right sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these Monty does it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um [noise] in there essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this ... in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests that also say that you know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's\nThat's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so hard and\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't ... stories\nAre especially and it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nYeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the\nFather and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and\nThe father who was a World War two buff immediately ... uh recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and uh his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the our dense battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle the ball ...\nThe one couple just said that it flew over head and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over\nTo see you know the the crash or at least I hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah what you want to do a different time warp or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into these uh goes points stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said\nThat as they were starting their walk so an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... you make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be\nThat one with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these ghost points to be seeing\nThe handles hundreds or we're going to come back and talk

I came away with is the thought that music is really just to consciousness raising toll ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also\nA key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded a haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of these stories in these tales of the supernatural usually start out fanned fan musician to

by the way now we will talk with him about time warps in UFOs and you will you stumbled into a time war for several months ago and then you\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast\nAm shooting them but before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that place turned out to be ...\nLas Vegas outside of Las\nVegas Nevada and um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd so it seems to me that there has been a space for us all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make a the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them\nThat are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance\nAnd say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place\nJust in case you needed to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I\nMean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but on you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\nThat if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified\nOur genetics that our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever if their goal is to come back here in ... it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this was going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know collars on us and and work like animals we hit the button and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that okay\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who go snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but\nThere may be some some ah beings that we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah

his experience in journalism and his interest in both go slower and the paranormal to collect and tell stories all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard\nTalking about some hunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much for having me on\nVery background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\n[noise] well the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nThank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and all like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here\nAnd so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it kicking off the euro ... quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to place with my publisher\nAnd initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of ghost stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a haunted World War two uh it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular guy\nThat that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know uh all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right a history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct a you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm\nA ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but you know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just went through the little big corn oh we're customs last stand ones\nAnd you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is that right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting is it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this ... in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some a theorist and also say that you know the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one playing to the next that's\nThat's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most haunting ...\n[noise] I think a consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father in the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately ... ah recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German ghost town or\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these\nPoints to be seeing the handles hundreds

Matthew ... with us his website is linked up at coast to coast am dot com couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghosts of country music more haunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nThere's a story of alone be Seventeen crew that watch to UFO track them for miles I think almost a about an\nHour and then of course a lot of people consider what's known as the battle of Los Angeles was a great story of a ... yeah that's\nAn amazing story and a\nAnd usually I think the was the story was the moving Nineteen forty one with John Belushi they made it seem like it was just based on what the war department called war nerves in other words this was\nA shortly after World War two I think er I'm Sorry after the bombing of Pearl Harbor I Believe it was in February of Nineteen forty two [noise]\nAnd aircraft gunners anti aircraft guns started firing in the air there was all kinds of pandemonium a and the war department just said the the people were nervous but I found it very uh an account from a very uh good witness\nWho are actually it was a ... a professor at occidental college um later he was just a kid at the time and he said that ah what heat witness was a huge object\nThat was pretty much just standing at setting still in the middle of the uh right above the ocean\nThat these guns were trained right on it and it didn't seem to have any effect and then it drifted it almost sounded like it drifted right over his head so it was a to me that was more of a story about something weird happening in the sky let alone a war nerves\nSwollen and they shot against the nephew people could hear ... sounds yeah and we're hitting something\nRight this this person actually said uh some of the shells were landing a few feet away from them and they had a the spotlight trained on it I think there's a a pretty dramatic picture that shows that\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book map you\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two well\nI didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors\nOut no nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two if you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and\nAnd some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call them shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nThere there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on their\nUh and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy mhm for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nA interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of

mean\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment

experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is\nI said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well with it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so [noise]\nUm for the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected does that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it\nExtended another words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to

phenomenon there he is\nDrawing crowds for a political events are larger than anybody's ever seen in a state lost the culture with my national true fifty thousand people a which is probably the biggest political rallies since President Obama to them they campaign for the question for Mr O'Rourke and protect us Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nAre as we know from twenty sixteen the past elections tend not to show up in the numbers proportionate to their share of the population clearly but trouble elections were in turn out a goes way down compared to presidential years uh and so\nAh the ... campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did and to have made or similarly to like what President Trump dude with white working class voters or non college educated voters and twenty six teams but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence already are due to the show that that's going to be the case\nAnd it was the interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nBut tend to be a little more Republican than ... around the country I think in twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of Hispanics for the Republican for twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are fairly gerrymandered comes many Democrats has passed on them and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress for the down about four four races or you know until the general elections have been a cake washer one party or the other\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no at that onto that they're really happy than a competitive\nStatewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a

reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nJust no I mean if you ask a Mr or kill tell you that nobody's come and ask for a vote or and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having a look at it all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state uh and some of these cars are very small uh some of the counties that\nIt is that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C is campaigning in February when I was down there he was then counties and having more people show up is to see him then voted in the twenty sixteen election in those counties are and so\nHe thinks that he's able to draw\nA people out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason for them to court because who has been so Republican uh one of the things he says on the campaign trails that he doesn't believe but Texas is a red state but it's a non goat extinct or you can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is his house district in El Paso\nVoted much either so there's not while he is certainly been a very compelling on the campaign trail is drawn enormous numbers of people\nThe evidence that he can get that the show up at the polls is not grounded in in his own history a you know his his house district is one of the twenty twenty lowest
