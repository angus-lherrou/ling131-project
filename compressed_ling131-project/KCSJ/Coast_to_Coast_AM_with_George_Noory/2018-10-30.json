in a in a very careful manner very ecological manner\nI mean that's not what greeted another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what their mind is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a\nWomen right now and and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty\nI mean think about it really isn't that high\nAnd that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said let's say you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut what you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\n... what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that [noise]\nA generation said was born ... being going right now it's it's actually a two thousand five thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there are but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... they're going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially the parents of Gen Z\nA but it ... what we're watching is is is a at a new crop of kids and and I tell folks I feel if it ... ... people say well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nThing you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are up I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that and\nI don't care listen it is what it is\nWell let's listen here here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want you want to you want it now you don't you want to free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where\nWe're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying so on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean it looks and I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but\nWhen you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know if it\nWere you talking about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to\nDebate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad him you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ... ... I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I you know why don't we run our [noise] our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government I'd diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles\nWe used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no uh you know we we've just taken all do we have removed the rules but what we've taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what\nWill what's going on with China China's enter freaky position China right now a\nNeighbor ... their their child law to write how many people uh many children family can help\nYeah they're going to have a really as many as they want now which is the absolute positive did last thing they should have done\nIt it's like you know I I ... I don't know why I really don't and I and listen I Am not that smart I'm really not in in in a few few asked my wife or my kid they'll they'll tell you but the ... here you have a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second we're already at the top of the hour we'll come back and talk about China plus will open up the phone lines as we talk about demographics and trends we're talking paranormal later on tonight [noise]\nDon't forget to watch a TV show beyond belief with your ... beyond belief dot com [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] five Ninety cheesiest dot com [noise]\nThree years ago making a murderer became less TV show than a force of nature and uncovered rave injustice in the criminal\nJustice it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan down the trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding among\nMounting a murderer is now in the ...

China and I'm Sorry that but that's that's just I Can't think of it in any other way to say what they've done is they've they've committed ... the biggest\nDemographic blunder in the history of the world with that one child only policies they did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but how's it going to catch up you\nKnow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born is babysit their newborn as adults\nDo not buyers that's for sure\nNo so which which you have is is they're missing and this is a real number\nI'm a five hundred a million people that were born five hundred million and a half billion so so here's here's how it works ... any country I don't care if you're if you're a a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes that have been big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAre and the the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well that will cook themselves because they're going to have a sexually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've gotta support that can't support themselves and now that they they have a whole new crop of of the kids that can't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah ... ... whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right and as we go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea\nLet's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war\nUm he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked in the I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to say do things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he run and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to bring down next man but more importantly that man has had actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white\nInclude and his wife\nAnd we had a president did something so by all can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh he has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember Trump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature that second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm the I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business is myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death when ward\nDiplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet on the horse I that I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about just diplomacy she knows school yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would get anyone to jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption in the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect\nI I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on ... and you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat well but let me let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential ... more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh\nDon't know I think what he has done his dignify but\nAt the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I\nMean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but you\nWhile they've got their company like air being beat up the rent to our house how such an I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're\nVery happy ... oh yeah and I I Would subscribe to that\nIt ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to you know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that is actually demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had is a very young right now and

won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough\nTruck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers sitting\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of like either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and that it's there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens\nWhen you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another means you're more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well\nI'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth\nOr is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need your oil\nWe've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water\nIt it just it I don't know I Am one of those always missiles no guinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim\nJong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening are in fact I said I said what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of\nThe north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern although not from a country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me as a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you possible\nIt has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi ah George and higher against um Hi my\nQuestion is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state ranking New York state and also a Phoenix has become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather we're Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts to hit we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida\nOver the ... California Nevada Arizona and New Mexico uh populations are going to increase the population of Florida is going to go from twenty million to\nThirty million wow or buy real estate in Florida now and just sit on it yeah it\nSaid I was in the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a button and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be going to ask what is it one more big into\nYou know shopping and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\n... ... what does it it's going to be huge\n... it's going to be off the charts with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder Karen desk here\nFor a big it is that a good market\nShoot off the charts huge can't believe it it it's like for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of job I go there all the time my brother has a house there\nUh yeah Vegas is is unbelievable\nAnd ...

Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and don't you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to him there seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast himself they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find another traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building tonight and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four\nIssues in cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things\nUh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point at which they do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an end jelly presents it\nIt was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never question did I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic a right to see 'em\nThere's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it I\nI I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she uh was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote

that\nMountains were crumbling in the sky was turning the dark color and it was just like an end of the worst end of the world kind of apocalyptic scenario and I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare\nAnd then we proceeded to the uh the base and uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was a the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there there is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was Bruce but\nUh she she she had the vision she was ah in in a city where ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a\nYeah yeah some people had it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but\nThere's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think\nA dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but you know he does talk about that\nWhat do you think of to let the the [noise]\nI I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was younger uh ...\nUh camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the uh uh Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card she'd look at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was and a\nWet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card\nA very often we get we get it a right to the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's\nThe one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I\nThink I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience [noise]\nI I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric\nWhich is northern California and the redwoods highway there and a driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's\nVery ... and as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing\nAll things that was wearing a hat and a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck as we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big for I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking about this we are in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more sightings there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway in the dark total dark\nYup uh and then you can get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know they're so that that was my my one and only a a big foot experience\nWhat about the uh thirty four episodes that occurred with you which is the favorite for you\n[noise] well I I Know when you actually like\nYeah I I'll have to say it all the connections with my my my parents with my mother ah when my mother came to me an innovation after she had passed away and\nAnd uh and told me she if she doesn't say much when she comes to me but she came to me and said and she was golden you know she was herself but\nVery healthy she you know she died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was gold and had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven that's what she told me and then that

different kinds of paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description [laughter]\nTell me about the open casket story yeah the open casket or the title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a in a I'm In our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral I'd I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was you know he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me [noise]\nAnd uh as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nAlso to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I look I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and\nHe said it then then the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course you know it was just in the casket and in dead but so I I definitely heard his voice and um it ... it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do you like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very curious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it isn't offered at\nAt the college and I am a tenured professor there and and\nI think there are a little bit surprised that I I propose\n\nIt I didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it isn't offered at a\nSize that most of these classes get but ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list I probably could have had a hundred people if we could've accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just the cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they've either they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical\n... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I tell you that after six weeks and the or seven weeks in the course into the corps\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different or you know types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nWe talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories and that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories\nAnd it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fine\nAh

population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why it and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout really isn't that high on that ... that's a clip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you you you want to half of the women there so you don't do it\nBut what you have to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nTom what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation Z was born ... being going right now it's it's actually a two thousand five thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different then Gen Y ... they're going to be this same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially he's the parents of Gen Z\nA but it ... what we're watching is is is a at a new crop of kids and I tell folks that I feel if it you know people say well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the money if they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled that you know there's all kinds of things that are up I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up\nAs soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated as as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality\nI'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that again\nI don't care listen it is what it is\nWhat led listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want what you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions that the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me\nThat makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country that horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean unless it I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president that takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter not that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nThat when when when you think of the mind if people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal\nAnd somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing can we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad

they're doing\nAnd that's right and then go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's going to happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are a economy is not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to the ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you I'm just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war\nI'm not a ... so all of those politicians that have looked in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I think this ethic Christian and a woman I wanted to see you things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the wiring star\nBecause she had nowhere to go in needed cash asked and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he run and possibly win a presidential nomination for the Democrats\nOn this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet\nAnd all they had was temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or tried to bring down next man but more importantly that man has had actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and crew and his wife\nAnd we had a president and did something so by all can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh he has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWhen it's over a decade about so I don't have a problem with can say whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you have found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school or by it and it but I'm the I'm not that old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful businesses myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have an eating to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy when ward diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman\nI voted for accounting ... how can you know ... if anyone that was bankrupt it four times and he had he that he could get back up yet I don't ... I I I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and he doesn't care if you are calling the race that\nGod Knows what kind of tired and other oh no yeah well I ... in that manner about appalling that she knows yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um ...\nAlright let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with Ken you want to jump in\n[noise] [noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI I think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilets or you pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system\nOn earth and the thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with uh uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThen well but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas\nUm don't know a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says but I'd rather be a little more presidential little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be [laughter] what they've said and and I'm\nA I don't know I think what he has done his\nBut at the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nI really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nThere's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere it's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know it's you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but it but I certainly would buy residential you would\nI Would buy residential every day of the week yeah just seller rental\nYes [laughter] yeah no in fact a you know I I have a house in ... but ...

Connecticut and a\nHalf and Adam Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattling around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it we'll get we'll get to come up with an executive rental forward and and that is going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want so ... got to be very big\nWhile you've got the company like air being beat up the rent out house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing they're\nReally they're very happy ... oh\nYeah and I I Would describe that what you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to\nYou know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah K C direct dot com K.

one technical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper your history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from\nA forty years old and under there are about Ninety million or um men are males or without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply\nInfanticide Ninety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a\nTon and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another means you're more Ricky no\nNo I just I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada the United states Mexico central and South American ... uh we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it\nI don't know I\nAm one of those always Mrs guinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for for for that to to to take place even even with wacko is like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn ... in fact I say I say what I see in\nIn Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh yeah it's about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist group than obtains new or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nThat that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child for a couple you cannot maintain a market economy\nLike shrinking population you can't possible\nIt has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't north\nKorea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi George and higher I guess I'm Hi my question is that uh\nIs the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state\nOut raking New York state and also in Phoenix that's become the largest city out raking a Philadelphia here\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather we're Kenny\n... that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shift

Russian interference in the last presidential election or barely a blip\nIn political advertising this year President Trump and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi meanwhile are featured in tens of thousands of ads Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie biker which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThat bottom line is that both President Trump and minority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up and quite a bit of mid term advertising\nOn specific to President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues in midterms advertising and that's health care and taxes [laughter] um so he ranks AS number three in most common themes in terms advertising\nRight and then in terms of those themes she is portrayed sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nThat's right and there's actually there's\nA surprising amount of positive Trump ads out there when we found that even um in some Democratic Senate at he's turning up in a positive supportive way and that set the scene and places like Indiana\nWest Virginia where the Democratic senator it's trying to hold onto his seat and said that Trump won quite a bit\nAnd twenty sixteen types of advertising like Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly thing when heat for Hoosier time with him and I let her out and\nWest Virginia has a candidate you know kind of saying I work with President Trump when he does what's right for West Virginia so there's been supportive cones that type of advertising one thing that really interested me about the state who found that although you think that President Trump you know with is\nLower than typical favorability ratings and how much he nominates the news would be just blowing things out of the water in terms of negative advertising President Obama actually far and away surpass him as a sort of milling in advertising back in twenty fourteen turns during his\nPresidency and that you're fifty percent of all Republican ads were anti Obama into for comparative purposes a Trump opposition type ads make up to ... percent of democratic ad\nAbout that and then uh speaking of Democrats for Nancy Pelosi practically all the ads have a negative reference to her\nReally difficult to find anything positive about Nancy Pelosi and advertising and that carries from not just a\nRepublican advertising but even democratic advertising he saw that a little bit here and there during the Democratic primary races and we found that you know about nine percent eight nine\nPercent of all ads out there have a sort of an anti proceed message so that really shows that Republicans have found her to be very effective sort of that and get his sales person for the Democratic party\nYou know we're speaking with Wall Street journal national political

Russia probe\nI'm Robert Mueller taking a look at the the ways that Russia may have interfered in the presidential race and of course that has wrapped up a President Trump and many of his associates in terms of the question about it but those two sort of hot headlines are barely making anyway\nIt all in advertising this year just a teeny tiny fraction of a percent\nOf all those political ads have anything to do with Russia and then on the Supreme Court despite hearing you know quite a bit from both sides that this was going to be such a galvanizing event for voters in both of the party's less than two percent of all the advertising is mentioning anything at all about the Supreme Court\nWhich Julie Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike away [noise]\nJust for some
