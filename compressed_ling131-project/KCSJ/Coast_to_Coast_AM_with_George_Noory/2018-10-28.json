behind what was this since ... science fiction story\nNow people don't think of Frankenstein as science fiction that you know sometimes it's sort of like a big morality play\nBut it really is in many respects ... one of the first major big selling Science Diction\nWorks and that's because um if you really if you think about the ... like it was like a I robot both the\n... version and then the robot that came before as most they're all kind of play on the same themes that are that are explored in Frankenstein between you know the creator and the creation a and in fact in the very first\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that is created\nIn the very first version of I robot which was in the Nineteen thirties so it sits down and read

you picked Halloween in shape the subject so it should have you use that as it is a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views on Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize\nThat a ... that\nThere are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is

you know there are you know the first for trout America you're the victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being executed for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course all the things on the planet that have had this problem just pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a

sound\nLike it would be Halloween bumper but it is for anybody who's seen the Netflix series the hunting of hill house [laughter] because that's been the theme they play and it's kind of a slowdown ... version of it in the promos let me tell you what a great show that was\nOn Stephen King praised it a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner and deserves it just a great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book\nRight has very little to do with any of the other versions\nOf the hunting appeal how's that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions where these slightly changed the title\nA but it was it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but it just it's not good so if you're looking for something to be a little bit spooky\nMore in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting of he'll house on Netflix um is is just one of the rare\nOr the Netflix series that lives up to all of its building where everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just say that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with with the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie is that\nThey they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see and I I don't know if I go to handle it if I had seen it so they look for that and you're going to join them for Halloween you are going to join the show

Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nIt helps 'cause the thing about the the witches and found that they're not just pressing a religion they're also you know business people their own shop\nThere all along you know they all have some kind of stake in the economy of Salem waiting for them and\nSo on and it's kind of like a little bit offensive but on the other hand for brings people into your shop that's uh net win for them so it it's it's again really complicated to like a fascinating degree the whole economy there\nYeah it's a little bit like come in here get outta here come in here what are you doing ... exactly that\nAfter they get the money anyway so then it did show you mentioned that that you know because of the dean Halloween town it it it has done it and because of the ... the sheet shift you're aspect of\nOf witchcraft as it was perceived back then that it's also a town where people spend a lot of time with you know we're will and goes and and I'm assuming some of the other universal monsters make an appearance in Salem\nYeah so that's another aspect so we talked about it being you know which city we talked about it being Halloween town\nAnd then I also part of that there are kind of kind of horror land right you go down the street of Salem you're going to see not just which is ... which cost and you're going to the Frankenstein monster and you're gonna see Harry Potter and Voldemort you're going to see you know the Addams family all these guys over there either by forming your actual street performers or as visitors\nUm three point that if you're a horror fan like horror movies than sailing you've got to kind of put that on your bucket list along with the no universal studios and some others in Hollywood and other places you want to go to the\nUm horror movie side so it's become a mecca for that as well so it has all these facets that kind of tired of them are dark I guess is the is the um common denominator but they're all different than their own way\nWe're talking with W Oscar each season with the which the magic and mayhem Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts and at the same time that you left the pirates right 'cause there's a there's a connection for ... years in ...\nSales built on the maritime trade there were some of the first people in the ... well not the country at the time before leaving the country who sent who've mapped out the Asian roots of trade like the first ever millionaire was a failing right because there were so good that trade\nThese of course that comes with pirates actually apartments in there and say on the line with the other stuff that you can kind of learn about you know they have similar stories mostly east coast where all the kind of pirates had out here and there so they have a whole entire pirate chapter of their history as well which again is another kind of weird layer the story of film that have\nLike I said earlier like to do the layers above just being the site of a trial and back and fixing to\nThe uh yeah and it it's not just a trial of course to write it was a series but that those trials it was so fascinating to\nTo talk about it earlier this year in in for people who have\nCaused inside or you know back and listen to the show it was ... I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you go what are some of the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nThat right and ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for that believe all the things you're told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great work of a literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of the rope on a hill you know Neal America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\n[noise] oh ... I mean some some ... only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist and not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or too cold tourist and throw happens the biggest one is October\nWhich will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open and I I Would never have guessed shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but the other but what they're realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round a film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what ... are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that it's actually a ... year round you any other time of year there's not that many curb\nBut in October for instance they got the barrel grouchy the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town then Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because they're just getting over Iran and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on\nThem and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts but that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not in front of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start hitting the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween of\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad though\nWhen they got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list\nOf things that are and I have a great night I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back\nOn Halloween or something on Thanksgiving weekend\nI'm ... I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget\nThe men from the train next on coast to coast am dizzy and put it\nOn your phone with our high argue radiolab\n[noise]\nEleven counts of murder I'm Del Walters Fox News just some of the twenty nine charges Rob Bowers faces the forty six year old charred with opening fire inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh this is what it sounded like on police radio rocket\n[noise] correctly it off\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment\nYou know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks rattling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time coal\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\n[noise] uh but this is the same reason that looked true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the\nFocus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the ...\nAnd not run for your life\nOr all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell in the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden or national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this\nToday so I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about are people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still

I had told my daughter that ... if\nYou walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that\nBecause I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder when he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in that\nAnd because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last ... last murders and the series so uh we\nIt's just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successive Lee after that um it\nIs is the use went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five [noise] the ah\nI think pretty while he use an ax to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could product him but um\nIt was not what he was trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\nTo get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general adds to the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of our ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me\nI don't know you but they're they're part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves\nThat we are ashamed of the uh\nUh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader ... by the way the last book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um [noise] ... ah I Believe with Weinstein I could have a last name wrong\nOr the or I've [laughter] I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there should be a hit\nAnd and one of the things I've learned from reading that is the white American ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding well it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the or if you don't get from\nSports I mean uh I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nHang on hang on to that thought on crime stories is this worth picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed at ... am ...\nYears ago making a murderer became less TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this even Avery and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with mark too of rebuilding them\nWanting a murderer is now in the ...

I've I've I don't know a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all book all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book is\nIs trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occurred in\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was really a watery ... ah what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live a ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns the hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got\nMarried they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs they they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened ... who happen to have happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death for that's a terrible picture because they live or die terrible bath and also I was trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or\nA an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age\nOr the way that houses were constructed in their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh\nText to these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... there what is it that always sticks with me that illustrate the party or just banking and that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it was soccer do we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors and an Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that weren't even on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right\nNow or never survive I mean he would never know that that was true Italian or the way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago except that it's important to them a crime story ... that's what crime stories are they're these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there is a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\n[noise] an an item of Jim nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um a dispute between the ... city council and the power company so\nAuthority that I Would say that still true today the people the\nThe chamber of commerce tribes parks in Politico wished that both go was known for something else right right\nThe or ... ... there is a house where the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of a more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal t._v. shows and people have to take tours of the house\nThe um [noise] uh but if you drive around but let's go there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the ... what looks good knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right the um uh I don't know that\nYou raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these\nCases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one in the more family was very well why they are and the community uh thought well off and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime war kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers\nIn ... or there's an effort to try to say just enough to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned economic speech that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his maps of trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder to families and whatnot and joining out the ah ah but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh

and the fire so you become a fireman so that you can spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to be thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity as they got along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what they're saying that that's that's\nWho he was a that's a that's how he knew himself I don't doubt\nThat Mr bell or had been the victim of terrible abuse as young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh he had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look\nAnd he said he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that that is in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the ... that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to be you know just some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative answers up here\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the ah the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the of that ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he ... his the documentation\nOf his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried a they carry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents through in about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which\nYou know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do is to whether it's just one person who was the victim of the movies rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm a nurse a sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a pent up thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first release came long before you came to the new world but\nUh it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight most often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that he was he was a true psychopath or psychopathic have no fear of over ... Eleanor I'd do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this the ... the Batman\nThe training that from his crime that he was not\nYou're not acting in fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with all this probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller metro train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen\nGoing to say well here's what the James's miss they miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about\nThe crime and it when that guy Illinois and\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they are going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the

I I think what was I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence ended the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out a gym now it's kind of you if you can test and said yep was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them in any\nWay you did write that adds a couple of the avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck out for their belief all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh the end the population using under about fifty thousand\nBut of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants in the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October\nWhich will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state fair they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open and I I I Would never guess their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say I'm over the course of a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer than people in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round to stay on the roads and become more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want\n... to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it actually around the time of year there's not that many curb\nBut in October for instance the barrel route to the old seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\n'cause they're just getting over a hundred people were like using the grave as picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar in federal party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over start start heading to the train and start any of your\nCars so there that's really good at ... at ten pm\nYeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you to take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ...\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad\nThen they got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's the real which happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker a and a Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts it is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list\nOf things that are have a great night in fact I'm

finish that\n[noise] you're you're eating out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nAre fading out no Canada that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world did by day and writing crime at night\nOr the other thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about\nThe man trying I didn't make a go wherever it and thought oh entered into this subject I got her like\nA I was a documentary\nAbout the murders and for the call or girl living with a mystery it's an extremely well done documentary him far above normal level I'm Talking about\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing\nWhich is that it's relatively obvious that the ... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is\nYeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime [noise] you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nI'm accepted in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the teachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat we've tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her desk and I became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early ...\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring you even know what your hundred plus years leader in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this just lingering sent some some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On my own exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they pay that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah\nWas a a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of the crime\nThat he had always believed\nThat uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nIt hey always leave that he had gotten away with it\nAnd he said that reading it in my book that\nIn our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to him yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about it\nBut it was it was a shy he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was this other fellow\nI I don't know why it was important to him\nTo go out I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it I'm ... I've I've I don't know a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and\nA lot of what the book is about is is that all all books all good books are search for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these\nThat these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was one of the ... or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nOr people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they\nThey got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible death but also I was trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or\nA an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can\nYou can do that in and it brings up a fresh context to these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism contact I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... and ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that I looked at that point you're just back there\nAnd that has to do with the the soccer in the case of taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a\nHe had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and tallying community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that weren't even on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickle deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story and that is what kinds of stories are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...

Ninety case yesterday dot com [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy genes and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it just said that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so so it goes wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of a an entire family and a lot of that is a is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nUm circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best\nSo somebody who might have grown up with a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know in an accident so they keep recreating that until they break the habit I'm so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and\nYou said you know somebody from being\nDestroyed in a buyer so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your green is ... thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that has ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that's that's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt\nThat Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse as young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh he had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look\nAnd he that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\nYou know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the ... that's what happened um speaks to the age in which he might have been\nSort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done this ... been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to be you know just in barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no answer you can have a speculative answers up to you I wouldn't speculate that\nHe had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and that in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the of that ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been\nDead at inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a a while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy and then he says he ... is his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentioned\nBut he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a sangre pretty openly the light I so I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents drew in about a live\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no I'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in\nYes um and then check\nWhat year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere had been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who was the victim of the movies rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse a sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers\nAnd they they just you know the it it's a pinch up thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse's there's a ... because he was not um [noise] it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight voted off and well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear a rabbi Eleanor had did not have normal fear and one thing with a parent about this the ... the ... and the training that from his crime that he was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller them after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this that affects about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what that James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about a crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research studies\nSo we moved on in front of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay\nSo we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also those Clinton minimum to\nUh and I may throw industry question about the Boston sprinkler that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give you the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nSign up now for coastal zone or free email newsletter get it today at coast to coast am Duncan\n[noise] three\nYears ago making a murderer became less a TV show then a force of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal\nJustice and it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part to overeat budding among\nReminding a murderer is now in the ...

Kevin's\nRight now let me ask you this um how would I go about checking the wire from the um the airbag module\nTo to the part of\nThe driver's side [noise] shoulder harness too I Would it be okay if I unplug the connector at the macho and then go to the end of the connector and do a continuity check\nYou need to disconnect the battery from the car weighed about Fifteen minutes and then disconnect that airbag knowledgeable and disconnect the pre tension or itself and then test between the module and the pretentious or what you got to be very careful\nFull though because you want to make sure there's a lot of lawyers on that and you draw the sensors and all the airbags you want to make sure you're testing the right one because if you an old meter\nMakes its test by sending a small electric current uh one lead and looking forward to come back in the other and looks at the time and things like that resistance to travel\nIf you connect to know meter to an airbag let's say you're pro but it was supposed to be this pin this pin 'cause a lot of words are very similar colors\nAnd they're small if you were to actually that would connect to a different pretension or\nInstead of the one that you have open there's a possibility you could potentially deployed and it could set it off yeah that's the so you want to make absolutely sure you're on the right one\nAnd that can be done a couple of different ways of the wires were different colors and you have a wandering diagram off the Internet that says will sleep in Nineteen and twenty were the ones I don't know what they are and this one but if those were the two and the wires yellow and green and they match up for those pins when you go to the other end of the connector and you see the same ...\nSame caloric advice you with this guy and this might be the worst advice I've given today so good advice view of the day\nBut I Would first just take that thing apart over by the ... to ensure physically look at a inspect do I see

Nineteen Ninety crown Victoria and that was the one where I call my heater slider controls\nWere work yes okay\nWell I got a used one out of control and I figured out what's wrong with this little shaped short\nMetal that were originally encased in plastic and the plastic as hard and and cracked off of there and that's why this wiggle around but that's what I was going to ask you for taking my part but I took apart this it was one you know\nIs there any companies you suppose rebuilding that wouldn't mind have this little ... shaped metal piece that's the way it goes\nIf there was a Seventy

and do it again\nYou know using pliers and break it up and do it again but that might be an idea I've used that to make ... for things that I couldn't\nGet I mean I'm not going to use them for like a like an engine burying Bush or something like that but I'm for dash controls and things were just they worn out you know my novel my stereo wore out at home\nIt was ... you know these the center broke

you\nWhen my son is in a part of this call what I Would like to have access to his website where you could check the F goes out before you purchase a frozen car is there such a size\nWell there's actually quite a few of them are you know one of the more trusted ones over the years was Consumer Reports they have got you know they they I\nGet suspicious anymore and everything but they claim to be fairly independent ... and you always got to look to see who's funding what and and what angle they might lean but they have proven over the years to be quite independent on their tests and they've also archived a lot of their test that they've done over the years\nThat you can go back to uh they test about everything car and driver motor trend wrote and track\nThey are they like to test more the specialty vehicles first but at some point they do get into a test of of common cars I and I say kind of just the more normal stuff\nAnd those you have to be a little aware of because they might score something higher or lower based on something that they think it's important that has no ... ... exactly and they will do long\nTerm tests where they put the cars into their fleet and they drive him a Consumer Reports says a similar thing there are but as far as uh what state are you thinking what you'd look and see okay this cars had this many problems reported um that sort of a thing I guess when they sure what you're looking for\nYeah that is correct\nSo it'd be kind of a forum were oh boy that that I got to think about that for a second I think a lot of it you know\nThere's Consumer Reports that they used to have a\nA I Believe they had a Consumer Reports reported by actual drivers type thing\nThey did that with a fuel economy sites fuel economy not go for a while it said here's what the government sticker or you know manufacture sticker set on the window and here's what drivers actually reported and they get you know twenty people that said well I got sixteen miles per gallon average\nI'm Out of all of them and the manufacturers that I got an Eighteen or got fourteen so sometimes it's better sometimes is when you\nWhen you talk about the well this is always a a slippery slope because if you put in\nA guinea company any type of car anything and you say rancid raves about this or whatever might have to be or I mean there's a website dedicated people crabbing about stuff right and guess what people do they're they come and crab about stuff that to me it's not an indication of what really happens with that\nThing or that car or that company or you got to be able to dissect that data and look for some common themes a because I'll tell you that people\nThat have vehicles can have a bad experience with any vehicle based on their used or their care right and it really can ... so I mean it would be hard to make the results be consistent because none of the problems are happening under the same\nThe same circumstances if you know if you have a certain type of engine it may fail quicker under poor maintenance than if you did good maintenance where it was last much longer\nThan people rarely go out and how how well something works occasionally you'll see something on a on a former website but it's\nIt's rare in this kind of is very dangerous but I got to say it that based on the\nType of car and the demographic of the consumer that it would end up in the type of comic could be different\nI totally agree yeah the experience factor um you know certain demographics might have more experience with automobiles than others and they could give you a completely different reports than a first time ... depends on the you know a but there's just\nThere's gotta be careful absolutely to answer your question re yes there are thousands of them and that's the tough part [laughter] thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five ... let's talk to T. J. T. J. you're on the under the hood show what can we do for ya\nHello I'm I bought a all seven for focus a little over a year ago had a hundred and eight thousand when I bought it up to a hundred and forty two cells and now on um I've\nHad to replace the tires three times a on the vehicle as gifts wearing your tires like crazy I've had the alignment checked three times um one time they\nAre so there was out of whack in and replace some stuff but a few times it's been fine I just can't get a sort of tires to last for\nMore than ten thousand miles before they're gone\nAnd just to be clear go down you don't make drifting videos using the U H M mode for\nThe ultimate her name on the [laughter] yeah no okay a normal daily driving I'm a little bit tired like normal ... and ... how many miles\nFrom this car now total want to wait and he's he's got it to one forty two so he's done a you know thirty thousand miles never take and so he has three sets of tires on already in ... I I have\nHad some ... some of those cars in our shop that had eighty thousand miles on a set of tires and there was like you need tires yeah I Know I'm getting down there because they're so light and they've got eighty thousand miles on a set of\nTires and he had three sets in thirty thousand miles so is it the front burning off first is at the back which ones are burned off quickest as it all of them\nUm the backers wearing quicker than the the\nBut but not by a lot um I I did change just two tires one time but uh the other set caught up I was trying to save some\nMoney that time they said we'll going down the road [laughter]\nDriving great [laughter]\nPart of the tire is wears out first down to the courts is at the entire face of the tire all the way across the outside or inside edge\nNo ... is the entire the entire face of the tire\nBut its entire face so that entire faces wearing off that thing has got to be way out of alignment come to compare that card to another focus\nThey just don't do that I mean our typical customers will go fifty to Seventy thousand miles on a set of tires on American roads right no no we're services you need to fight yeah you're on the gravel every single day like were you know a post office or something you might wear your tires out pretty quick but we have people that drive cars\nOn postal routes that get thirty thousand miles out tire on All right\nSo and that's really abusive on a gravel exam paper\nUnless you're the Wilders bit unless it's cars been in a significant accident and written and repair incorrectly or has a significant alignment issue this is not easy ... it's\nGot to be out of alignment and I would want somebody if you're taking it to the same alignment shop I Would go to a different climate shop and try to find one with ah the old guy with a cup of coffee and maybe a dog\nYou know a lot [laughter]\nI mean the you know so much about a Lyman see can look ahead and find those overhaul block away this\nYear she's out three degrees yeah one one of those guys what if they got a cat and then well the night I don't know if I Would I don't trust them go to that shop you know [laughter] but but there clearly something has to be eating these tires up and someone should be able to catch that right yeah it's got to it it take\nTo eat a tire that quick it's an all four of them and even all the way across are they smoking and you guys as they should at least ... car guys when you say the guy with the dog and the ... you have I'm referring to are right but if you had\nA guy in mind right savvy veteran yeah and you have a guy and I said I'll give you he already had an alignment shy and he had the August ... one of the\nOld car guys around they should know the alignment guy you need to

this is Alan ... junior and you're listening to other [noise]\nWelcome back everybody it's time to get back under the hood without motor medics welcome back to the end of the show where they have you with us eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk declare it's clear it's you're on the on the hook shown what can we do for yeah\nSee I got a two thousand Ford Expedition five four leader I've had it for five years and every year when it gets down to about thirty five forty degrees if uh idols really rough and then like I say when it gets above ...\nHere's an idle rate and does it stay that way all all the time under thirty five\nUh yep and cut up all winter long it'll do that um you know when I when I drive at um I'll get home park and if I just let it idle in the driveway there it'll be fine for a couple of minutes and then that just that falls right back into\nIt was it cools off it'll do it but once you get running down the road of warms up a little bit and it stops\nRight yeah that sounds to me like you might have a vacuum only going on that's causing it to run rough as it cools down things contract you can get it into a gasket doing that causes to run rough when leaks does the check engine light ever come on\nA checking your lights that on since I bought it but if you know it pops on and off once in a while\nWell that would that would be another thing that would lead to that exact thing too as it runs lean it throws a code because the engine is trying to max out those fuel rooms and when they get up to the top they say yeah I Can't give it any more fuel to make this thing runs smoothly\nLet's turn the light on the engine warms up the light turns off\nI've also had those exact problem\nIn the last week with someone who tried\nTo run they said I'm going to try you Fifteen ethanol in my vehicle because you guys have said that it's new on the news it's OK to run it and they said but I'm Upset with you because I put it in and my check engine light came on I put the regular back the ten and it went off\nAnd I told them\nIf that's the case it's not the fuel\nYour car is already running borderline on being you've leader at the edge of the parameter already which is going to affect your fuel mileage no matter what you put in so just like yours words\nIt's close so I said bringing in just want to look at it I'm just going to know charge I'm just going to scan it I Want to see what I see and I look at it and sure enough the fuel terms route Seventeen and they've got regular know ethanol and I'm like\nYou're close I open the hood it's got a vacuum line on the inside of the intake that's correct on the edge not bad but just the tiny little bit\nRight I sniffed off the end with a pair of scissors and slipped back on the field firms went to one says like you know go put what you want it and it said that it's just kind of indications so yours\nIs running bad now but I Would bet at at some point it's probably going to run bad all the time but the temperatures are going to change so now it it does it at fifty or sixty you know and then all the time\nAnd it could be in to a gas gets my first step and diagnose than yours would be to plug it into a scan tool and I read the fuel terms when the engines warm\nAnd then I'd let it sit there and as it cools off watch them and if they keep climbing up as it gets cooler and then finally it starts running rough and their way off that's going to explain to everybody sort of feel tremendously well a field trim just ... the the engine computers says\nWere designed with this much fuel going in and this much air going in to runs move in with gasoline that's fourteen point seven to one they call the stoic you'll metric ratio is the big\nFan I weren't just means ... pretty sure that at that rate I'll get right even\nThe fuel will burn it's cleanest with his most power and most completely you too much fuel its rich gets too much fuel and it's it's all the tailpipe to lean a that's also bad you get excessive heat and that can damage things so you want that perfect ratio while the engine computer at the perfect ratio\nMeasure by the oxygen sensors will say zero you\nKnow we're we might we're ... we're both in between let's ritually originally originally ... were right there were zero well if you start applying\nUm you start doing things like adding ethanol to fuel you go five ten Fifteen twenty thirty percent even going up while the ... the computer can adjust for that it's completely electronic so it says less at more fuel were still perfectly safe no check engine light\nIf you have a vacuum leak that's a very small as it gets bigger it'll keep adding fuel\nUntil it can't any longer when it could end the ... of the thing that can add via the computer or take away the up and if it like a leaky fuel injector well if they can't do that anymore it turns the light on gives you a warning but there are situations like this truck that\nAt times it can control that fuel and keep it in that range and keep the light off but when it gets cooler if it does develop a leak and that's just one of the things that could do it it could be as simple as a dirty masterful censor too but when that changes that's when the light comes on\nAnd if you had a vehicle doing this that it did not have a light on and it seemed like everything was\nFine it can

[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back everybody it's time to get back under the hood with motor medics\nHave thriving are one of our divisions is buying end of life vehicles and we buy 'em from the public and we buy 'em from total yards and different places just stuff that's\nPeople think or are done and we see people that folks that call us\nAnd set us pictures that say this car is done it just it's it's war out and we look at her like really that's wore out they all have different opinions and then you'll have people bring went out and say oh this things at the end of his life then you get there like oh my gosh you've like\nMore down to the now than there is nothing left to discard it it just wore out one into the other\nAnd they use every ounce of energy they can get out of that car so it is a matter of perspective when the end is on a car like that now the things that we tell her who does all the time that I think it's important to keep in perspective is exactly what ... what's that ... what is the condition of the structure of the car\nIs the body clean and not rush to the point where it's structurally not safe\nOr please understand the difference between the surface rust on the paint and structural rust\nUs there's a huge difference a cosmetic rust is going to happen just like you get a wrinkle on your forehead as you get older you are what your hand you know ... what if you have a structure where\nSuspension components both on where the struck towers right underneath the hood where the rear suspension arms both up or the cradle is underneath the car if you've got structural rushed in those areas as the vehicles getting older especially for our listeners in the northern climates and the rust belt that are going to put that car over the edge quickly\nNow if the body down south or in the heated areas of the south west so we got listeners all over the place and that thing is solid as Iraq there are people\nTaking vehicles to four hundred thousand miles five hundred thousand miles interiors where out of them quicker than anything from the sun and so it's really it's really a matter of perspective but the the the in my opinion\nThe hundred and fifty thousand miles car today is Twenty years ago was eighty thousand miles vehicle if just to give some perspective to it does that sound about right more in there\nOr you know and that's I live in in the heart of the country where um where it snows in and we don't really go out in the snow unless you have a four wheel drive and we don't put chemical on the roads so structurally it's pretty sound you know and I I haven't done a whole lot to the vehicles sense I bought\nIt but you know I still got to fight the dashboard where my daughter fit it off when she was mad at me and things like that so I'm just kinda curious as to you know how long can I hold onto the\nNet and I wonder but also by chance\nThe five year old daughter and your child just do the five point three motor you're too old to Silverado will take you\nWhat what what's a in your town do you guys are at two hundred and forty five so yeah and I've seen him regularly at three Seventy three fifty a regularly or with sure with no major work done to him other than just maintenance things when a cooling pipe would break or a water pump goes out or\nA you know if the if you get a buildup in it from just time of not getting the oil changed correctly that it's All right hurry relatives the transmission is if they haven't pulled a ton\nI think they usually they they can make it to two fifty a but if they get well I think I\nDid have an accident where I Do have a new transmission about forty thousand miles ago I er and I'm One of them pulling anything I was just a overlooking an approach you know and it just didn't go into reverse for me so that was pretty exciting going down that ill but\nYou know but I Do have a relatively new transmission so everything else is pretty south\nYeah when we look at those trucks the just to get very specific about that vehicle the temple or in GM's made him for years they last well unless you overworked them then they will wear out when they are overloaded and overworked or the front differential do we'll\nThe front differential ... I wouldn't know typically last\nAs long as you don't have a ... bad and your slowly leaking fluid out and then you run the grease autumn run away a lot of them um\nThe transfer cases it's kinda the same way I mean if you're just not but when you start work in those things that they will break down one fifty to two fifty somewhere in there\nI don't know it's not an easy question to answer but ah if you've got a non rusty truck and it's working good and you consider that when you drive through the lot and I just have to do this the other day they have the new two thousand Nineteen Sierra trucks sitting out in a lot and I thought it would drive by and see what the prices on these things well do you want to six point two liter\nLoaded up half ton Denali fear the you know the just I went for the highest price when they had and that one of the highest price went in that particular line was sixty eight thousand dollars for half the ticket\nAnd the more over the more basic one\nWas sitting at about fifty three so you can\n... you know put that in your ... year old to this costs in yeah not a lot right now right it's got to be a pretty strong decision\n[laughter] Aaron thanks very much for the call good luck so if you if I were just asking you I'm going to go look at trucks what mileage would you like to at what point is really start to get to twenty five to fifty I\nDon't wanna give you a different answer you don't even I'm leery at one fifty but\nI Want to know the history of the ... I got ya that sound fair us\nYeah definitely because there are some really I have some customers that have some vehicles and I've been looking around for some like a a ... a new low newer one than than the old one I have and I know there's some customers I have with a hundred and fifty to a hundred and Seventy five and I love the on those\nBut I find myself looking at some that I don't know anything about so I'm trying to find something in that Ninety two hundred range\nBecause I Know if it runs out here trying to hack up with and it might be good but when you get yeah these you just\nDon't I should say I'm leery at one fifty I'm paying a lot of attendance\nAt one fifty Darren thanks very much for the call good luck let's start to Aaron in Iowa Aaron you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nI was driving through Iowa and I've got a two of you know\nWhen you got stuff out automatic but make it a flex fuel I mean when I was down there and I felt like I thought I had the eighty five and it was too old seven a gallon versus you know but to sixty seven or\nEight Fifteen and versus the two eighty seven or eight ten I'm just wondering what the ... all the computer on she thought it was can you run but he eighty five\nNo you've gotta you've always got to look at a forward is going to have a yellow fuel kept in the factory when they are flex fuel\nBut you you've always got to look and see if you open the gas store on most all cars they will be clearly labeled as to whether it's a a flex fuel vehicle or not um well there'll be labeled if\nThey are right and it if they are exactly might not notice right\nUh and maybe the stickers gone but you can check your vehicle identification number on Google it'll tell you if that engine was produced that where I Do not believe all ego booster flex fuel right you will you will need because I have seen the ones that aren't um\nI I Would be you know you don't want to put you don't want to miss fuel a vehicle while while you're okay with you know eat Fifteen in anything two thousand one up the way they've certify them\nYou're not okay putting a complete mess fuel in one by the eighty five you will you will have problems with computer can't adjust for that much um\nWhen you do that on accident what do you what do you do well if you had half a tank of fuel and they're already and you put eighty five on top well then you only have a ... you don't have a near the higher percentage and eighty five means it can be up to eighty five we've seen some with a lot less in their depending on where it's being dispensed from that's that's at the\nYou know that's what the hands of the person that owns that pump at that station that's controlling that so [noise]\nUm yeah stick with stick with the with the regular Berlin's the Fifteen and under but also go on the Internet and find out for a fact what your vehicle takes and\nAll that this never\nChance it if you're not sure right only do it if you earn less than a leash or learn that'd be ready to refill that because it it's\nA lot I think there are probably people that have it they don't do not know they have it now we

and back out the driveway and they give it a little bit forward and then and then the next time I get it from yesterday we can do that for three or four times until the end of the war and then it doesn't do any more\nInteresting if it does it just until it's warm it's possible that we've got a vacuum leak we go down there that you wrote quite a bit but it's pretty common yeah and they're different in different vehicles different sources when something warms up what an engine warms up\nA lot of people have an noise like do here I have a knock engine knock into it warms up ... do we
