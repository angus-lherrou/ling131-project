documentary film by that title in fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series use broaden his uh his Web is net and his uh focus again\nOn the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies he learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell you may have been focusing on missing for one one for the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so areas with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing

a\nAbsolutely no good times on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people\nAlways reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and I started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year can you recap the hoop a project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with the worst super wealthy\nTo me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if we you have Twenty years of police officer you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent what will finance you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Want about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that Randy and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather and I started to bring us together and then I went up there\nMake contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury and I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that\nWould be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nAs the paper was written up before I get there so they right\nThere in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce smell but to a very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before and we explain to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of people have never read the paper and they read little news brief here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit with a scientist who\nReads

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side\nOf the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different and one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how's Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a cynic long hair I you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone so uh I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous and counter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and\nAnd find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things were an explorer from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explorer notes that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I'd I actually spoke to him large hairy bypass said he'd\nNever seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church latter day saint church and it's in there so to say that these things haven't happened ridiculous\nOn the first interview the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques valet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild like mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge here covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a Jacques book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this summer fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and uh his book which was a Kickstarter project\nRight um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on the speak for topic it\nWas a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archive articles sixteen eat in Eighteen twenty do\nGreat stuff knocked Indy here we're going to take a short break and come back and sometime in the next hour will open up the phone lines you can join the conversation from big what the little feet here thinking as into the break with a song from waiting for Columbus\n[noise] they can soak up sprint advise patients\nProvide guidance on training veterinary care workplace safety and much much [noise]\nAmerican Made its onset of making sure we get\nToday their mission is more important than ever\nBecause when you were in the right kind of making movies\nShows ...

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five\nOr six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just plan to playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he can figure it out for you waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot\nIt must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and when I started writing the missing for one one books\nThere is a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so as\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... of just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in ... where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nGoing back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people that die hards don't like it\nThe UFO die hards like it even less they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can't ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents so they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eight years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely no\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me\nDon't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my TV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how got their so called\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big what milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries\nAnd different kinds of groups um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives\nAre in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across it you're stuck on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ...

documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere in New York\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and sunk\nAnd I had to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to me that the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and great misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over ... story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven added if we get this email from this young filmmaker and Sarah ... well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that\nI'm In being Indianapolis storyteller she wanted to render the story as the screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part little theory than fifty two and major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we can find it rather\nThat we only the many theories on but\nSo you're getting ready to bust the screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so very family and friends he raced out and and they contact with them\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am a movie veterans and know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um\n[noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help rewrite the book [laughter] ...\nThat I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several months we finally met\nAnd then uh you agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest into twenty four ... um and then when we did it I guess the project picking the and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but

commander hush and everything we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out if they're sincere conscious and conviction and so um we were able to make great you know ... um\nWell within them more were published after the war for like two and a Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt and the uh here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men want to do and there was a chapter on it voted in Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger or in the end of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot\nHe was a manager who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic hopped on military\nAsking for radar and more technology for his that Marines because Japanese submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother says commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that there are rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick they could walk on their back\nYou know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs they oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to lure of the sharks and and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realize oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day\nOkay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by\nYou know the second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so there were some\nMen who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the ... and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nOr while the other one poured the water through it into this into his now and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you know take small for it is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ...\nAnd\nBlood vessels bird\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did some that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced finished them off\nYou have a somewhere as pilots who winds up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosions coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there's any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd you know the army side of things said we'll let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still went to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it and\nSo you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son\nWho you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on his story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after\nWhen word was released about it that he would\nTalking with Linda incidents are a lot about

just sort of dropped through the cracks or that made their survival even more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines I who had received the next thing that is\nA ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and I as a matter of fact had received a fitness report saying as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report a rival for that and shit I guess that means I don't have to report non or ride over here\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it said the Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one ensure a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors to find it in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to head back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is if I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left an airplane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to him and leaves men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected than the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive in and that was the burden they carry till the end of their life\nYou know it's wartime as ... said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but or is it an accident that this story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day and well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the time they did not believe it was an accident so the rats to occurred beginning on August second\nI'm Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August\nFourteenth ... between the time zone fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not and now that Indianapolis had been sank the newspapers did not release it Washington not Washington did not release it\nAnd tell the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headline on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines you know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small article you let the Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time I\nBelieve that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that with you know resulted in lots of

him slide given that the war had just ended or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship

four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was a gentleman I mentioned earlier this some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship and\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nA the ... group which has the vessel that were slew responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts than they were the first one to be successful\nOr Japan I'll tell you what Joe that's quite a bit to chew on their lips let them tackle at least the last part of that question\nA nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this was\nThe most closely guarded secret as the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and what it was and his uh his companion captain games now when he was a long to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would have now and and I don't know that extra precaution with taking\nBecause this ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it but element was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of funny stories that were told about what might be in their right though Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this\nLarge crate that's delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by marine guard and of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or send to toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur [laughter] you know [laughter]\nNo one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter] [noise]\nYou know I thought it was a a an odd post script sort of the the ship itself got blamed in the court marshal they were a thrashing around to blame somebody in the shifted self got blamed a which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship so they were saying that that was happening and they thought that was the ship fault\nFor getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out I'm also as a treaty cruiser as Sarah mentioned she had a single through back that when uh all the way through a ... from ... stern and\nEnded in certain cruising conditions in the in the matter is that in that craving conditions the multiplier tight creeping condition that through back then segment off by water type ... heads and hatch is\nThat in order to cruise and hot South Pacific they created in a slightly different condition which with what's called yolk modified and not let some of those folks kids I'm not the old or in other words not water type that when the ... was blown off the ship\nAnd she was continuing to make way through the water the was just flowing in three that that a long three a deck and so um\nThere were a lot of questions and the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she would open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on those questions\nSome of the families who had last man on the shit I blamed captain they even know keeping that three deck open with standard procedure\nWill try to get one more call in first time caller Jay W you're on with Lynn Vincent and Sarah bloody talking about the

on what's become a wildly successful and respected investigative project the missing for one one series of books\nAnd a documentary film by that title in fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series use broaden his uh his Web is net and has a focus again\nOn the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies he learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell you may have been focusing on missing or one one the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so here he is with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\nHey George thanks again for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archive work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year can you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with the worst super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains to the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if we you have Twenty years of police officer ... years of investigating an HR\nYou're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring us together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot in studied them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side\nTotally different they they act different they walk different they look different and one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever\nBut we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nIn ... that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat\nI [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how's Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a cynic long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundred United notation at the bottom\nThat does said maybe this is what Daniel Boone so uh I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and\nAnd find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again in tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where and explore from the latter day church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes\nThat this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I'd I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy bypass said he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with the latter day church latter day saint church and it's in there so to say that these things haven't happened ridiculous\nOn the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques valet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge here cupboard being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter]\nYou know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big for topic\nIt was a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear this\nYeah I I uh I was part

disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah ... and a claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I Am blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually with a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about four and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was the ship that carried the bomb\nAnd I had to know more about it so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know\nThrough looking to what was available at the library I still find anything someone got to tell the story from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought I Would I could that thought someone will tell this story before I'm old enough to do it fast forward graduated from college and no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I thought out the survivor and found Palmer\nYeah who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that's kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd when for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story incorrect\nWide and greet misperceptions and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell over the theory exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck well what's there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm\nIn being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part mini series and she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers\nBut we only base mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need the right stuff while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so very family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but a eventually over the course of several months we finally met\nAnd then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project tickets free and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the people that were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective if it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprint commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk\nBut I'll tell you grab me ... my father was a ... at ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the us as Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle with us now or where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on the Annapolis story has really ... man uh before I get asked and not as it is to you know\nCircle back and the men who marry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army name Robert an army major named Robert from him\nAnd he had spent the last couple of years after the war renting down all of the material that they hear the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb or on the continent of Europe\nNo one that messing with me and then burn and very components of little boy in island\nUm status final breathing yet or I mean Europe and and the conflict and so in writing the whole book we try to pull back that ran in bringing in a lot of other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hash amount overhead and for your you know in the county has got I'm highly commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where you have to recognize it even matter of the men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and Dixon and doing one of them\nWill tell you what are we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of

C. S. T. dot com you weren't supposed to do so yeah\n\nSo ... I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander ... lieutenant commander how should not have as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great ... um\nWell with it and then more sort of published after the war first published in Nineteen fifty two Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from commander had him at a point of view and there was a chapter on it the voted in Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot\nHe was a commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that there are rescue arrived\nThe men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds\nOf them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they oh there's food just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to lure of the sharks and and catch one [laughter] and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are or\nHappened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship and everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they're having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippine see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups that for rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so that there were so any water that was available with only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were ten men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the ... the hydration itself with perversely causing then to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason that some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his now and thinking that that would straighten themselves out well of course they didn't\nAnd then others when you know take small heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin coping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood that food for\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention or we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things said well let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nSo you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son\nWho you know this gentleman richer the Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and to what came next is a equally amazing we'll be right back\nTo more about tonight's just logged on to go to ... am dot com\nAds\nAround them one\n\n\n\n\nFive Ninety three dot com\nOctober twenty second what's new today on the ... hour radio lab I was on fire radio ... in the studio brand new episode was the legendary\nHome and garden me none of them and treat them when you're leaving to talk about his new album and of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles news radio presenter studio check it I'll know\nBe ... was\nSprings Colorado is news ... accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety Jaycee Jaycee when\n\nMurder but it was a mistake on name Anthony Fox news that's what the Saudi Arabia foreign\nMinister tells Fox and the killing of journals ... at this sounded constantly ... turkey\nIndividual instances of science so he obviously was tremendous mistake made components missing them to try to cover that is because\nWe really appreciate what Mexico as on the border we're for the\nFirst time this has ever happened [noise]\nHad oh really is because they respect the leader of the United states\nOn Twitter yesterday Mr Trump said those migrants seeking asylum must first apply in Mexico he said if they fail to do that the U.S will turn them away but Mexican officials have said migrants seeking asylum are under no legal obligation to apply in Mexico\nIt's eleven minutes now after the our ... this morning Americas first news\n\nTwenty four seven three sixty five Europe and had an everyday so you don't want something like Medicare part D to slow you down at Walgreens will take care of your Medicare part D prescription saving you time and money make the switch to Walgreens today and get more ... earning a hundred dollars or more points campaign up to\nFive dollars on each Medicare part D prescription Walgreens is more prefer pharmacy well being trapped in Nineteen oh one\nSo when he's always prefer versus another farmer Sam ...

Jay\n\n\nExclusive stories and unique perspective you are listening to America's worst news this morning when the\nWeather is walk them into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain this\nTo what I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than than people expect that they would\nAnd we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge amount\nSo maybe forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent so districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfied with the president and\nThat's a one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's very interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're at the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler [noise]\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats garnered more votes than congressman\nOr butler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as the the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual race there in that\nUm that hasn't been considered you know one of the swing districts but Carolyn longest campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points [noise] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with uh the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this of the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of\nEnergy and enthusiasm from voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women are\nShowing more of a preference for a democratic\nControlled house and are also more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of mid term that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like a women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female\nChallengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blowout for hidden there\nGot it we're speaking with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races titan is mid term elections near to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes said this is an interesting race um would all is definitely being outraged by Carolyn up or do who is also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta this current events and one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down on the ticket and that\nUm but go could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and a sort of you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seating a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy and then the second to the to Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congressman Jacky Rosen who's a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada\nUm this is a little bit\nPut a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be I'm a little bit more of a stretch their\nChristina it's Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson\nWas on the program as wants to buy you know was not Martin making the\nLottery the centerpiece of your

Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last person to do it\nOn usual for the president you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do it again it has not happened trying to Ninety two\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite a manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been kind of a different in many respects to the president and the other example he's saying things about about a blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gone crazy\nHe said that they were his biggest threat up and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[laughter] that's what he said ... part of this is also laying the groundwork\nTo blame the fed a if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets and you know even though there was some speculation there about why he's doing this if you look at the ... the president has\nInfluence fed policy the president has a lever\nTo get to nominate the people that sit on the fed board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA vote every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's into doing this just to kind of a running public criticism of the central bank\nAnd the you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year\nAnd while the fed says presidents for criticism isn't going to change how they operate it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else as per usual when the president do something like this he started the discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n[noise] ... exactly right people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is two and the President Trump\nIs probably elevating that debate and saying look the unemployment rate slow and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as as a black disappears and the economy because you don't want to have inflation\nWill President Trump is saying here as well world the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates\nThat we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nWe're speaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter his piece is called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who said in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be catering to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\nTo write the question isn't very difficult right now the most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates so the decision to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case that year from now let's say you're from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do and so the question is on a coach or you don't have as much conviction about the policy path to the president's critics\nAnd get into your head at all I Know some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you don't know if I as the other side which says look markets begin the question of credibility\nThen that's even worse so it might actually from their back a little bit but the ... so far as saying we're going to ignore the\nWe're we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and people criticize it you know then we'll deal with that next\nBig wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick to morose is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nF.
