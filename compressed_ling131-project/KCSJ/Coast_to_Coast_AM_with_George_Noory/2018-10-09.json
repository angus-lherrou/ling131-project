{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "That that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it ... it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you\nKnow if you had a um you could out of the airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink I think you've got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems may be much much more brittle much one that they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think\nAt writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\nIt is easy is it the human being\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working or\nEven the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer a big thought that perjury interesting reason which was\nNew you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people got excited about a bunch of money came that everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up to space up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the good it it can it if you out of business it can make public any department in your business\nTo ... to ... percent better ... percent more profitable or it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those\nYeah winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances and they are uh we'd probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\n\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said ah there's a camera and it can make sure if it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also step for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a promise killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I'll let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen\nOr the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's going to happen\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective at their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you going to argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ...\nOr ... whatever country you are and and a third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if he has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars you see the day that\nYou know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with artificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo find out what George Norris

know\nUm I I have a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job this word for that that's called B humanizing mhm because\nIf if you just use a person for stand in\nFor machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that that we invented a is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically\nMost my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years\nRight and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees as it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so what ever\nIf you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it's a one back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future you know there's gonna be the sweat thing ... billion people are going to use it what do you think that's going to do their jobs you\nCould've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents at the stockbrokers on the yellow pages on the newspapers\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper a Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away\nIt's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys a bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your flew back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled\nWe don't have robots that can that can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so well correct\nCorrect but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes other batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that that power these things for very long\nSo right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house silver figures out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm\nNot like you said that oh you know yet\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going\nWe're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer\nJust pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we're we're so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book to for the age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore because\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave his prosperity\nYeah and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented the nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations and merge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that um\nThat\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nYou if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make as a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's gonna what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is already Fishell intelligent you it is to be frightening if if you saw if\nYou were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and uh you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you\n[noise] wow that's that's great stuff I'd like to I'd like to talk to all three of those things I'm to the first one you know you mentioned corporations that he's been ... it's very interesting to me the large companies don't usually make leaps the of the original doll companies are\nAre used to say only ones left and then it was just he listed gee it's none of the companies and world the Dow originally the big powerhouses or they're\nYou know sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt a blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see that you mentioned them and I'm\nA poet the same story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't catch on earth right blockbuster on another one\nExactly what's going to drones agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and you know where where in search early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs was going to be laws it's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't up because uh that's a very real\nWorking remote\nYou know I I kind of hope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like because you can just list um\nCareers that you you can't like the electrician or a ballet dancer or anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything that requires a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are in the information industry then yeah it was just\nThere was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday you will you know should the facts from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials\nKind of thing for the army did really stay with us by when you come back and take some calls in a final trap next on coast to coast am\nThe website is now streamlined for mobile devices Greek news if your coast insider simply want to enjoy our website on your bones visit goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android ...\nOn the radio on the Web site id case yesterday dot com [laughter]\nTo go back to the doctor\nLine would to coast am\nCall a city or\nThis audio is for your review now for ...

on this you know pale blue dot\nIt's gonna Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the show interesting topic I I just wanted to ask your guest there um if you think that the way technologies progressing that we may get to that you are to be an age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay\nHe said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours and so you have to ask like well what happened 'cause GDP did kill off a default just like he thought\nWhy are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education they should grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor because I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home\nBut not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've\nIf if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we will have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a fix\nMy road probably\nGood a machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... would we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\nTo ... face style than than being a wife and now ... and ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\nAnd ... ... women and ... and ... it gets half the fan on with math than\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're in the guests bart is entirely right um we are using a ton of his\nWeapons which may kill decisions of course we've done that since landmines wheat crop we dropped dumb bombs or I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill 'em so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push ups\nAnd we don't know who's going to die the debate is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more than systems that operate completely economists say that you can just released in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions that part I agree with you\nThe fourth day smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just reach dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to how jump to a very\nSimple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventy fifty nothing happened what if you look starting Seventy fifty shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we decided to let them and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of well created\nA eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um you know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to feed the hungry people\nIn the world no question that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost

you know within the organization thing very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you can make this up\nYou know you're that you're that nerd we went and [laughter] and you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with

time that I was kinda thinking about writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like a crazy\nWhich is one reason I Would actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to tell they talk about their experiences because there's so many people what Adam\nAnd I also wanted him to yeah I wanted to write it so people will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all\nInto the ... like you said not a lot of ... minutes well once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nMy gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them to go because I you know when this started happening to me um\nI didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand [noise]\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of the things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans leave and go so we're almost the majority\nWere barely a minority and that's grown up\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nNot all sing\nYes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nHas nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because your personal situation\nYes she did you did\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated\nWhen it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with us\nYou have been doing sham me these what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI used in what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise] um it\nWas an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron out a phone but like a regular camera and it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else\nIt's interesting you know\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through\nThis year I mean how did I start to heal from that you started to get the strange thing\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how big me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and and help them investigate it and um\nI I started you know and then after I saw the first coast and a photograph I um\nKnow I kinda panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before I had a skeptic as in it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know much\nRight right I it it was a navy this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing chaos\nAnd when you're in chaos um you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some color because you different things would come out I became I I think maybe a little bit of an expert in it\nLike that was your spirit guy because I've never heard such specificity because you know Julie we're born with spirit guide to kind of not just through life and if we're willing to be open and less than they are there to help us and I was a really good thing because kind of hurt that woman in the car in front of me and she has no\nBaby it wasn't a woman in front of you\nTheir life that your guide with saving it was yours [laughter] that's right\nI went oh okay [noise] does it change you\nWell it it in in a second it did so I go to work have a weird day [laughter] because I'm thinking\nYou know what a crazy morning that that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives in Cincinnati and Pam is Mona sister who was killed cameras in the car when\nIt happened so is pants husband this\nSustains permanent brand brain damage up as of today from that accident [noise] so called Pam tells the story and she says\nHuh she just want to hear the other half of your story\nAnd I said sure she said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you call this one I had found in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to go reach for the phone\nBut I was paralyzed couldn't move\nShe said I imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today she's like yeah you would and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nSure and the big lesson just\nIs about paying attention\nPeople say what your book about and I said I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you to pay attention\nAnd trust yourself when you take your picture ... mhm are you aiming at something or\nDoes it just\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I sat the phage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it wasn't hadn't all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was\nThat smoke is like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them I could see\nTheir shapes either form it without the smoke they were not there you could not see them\nAnd without the smoke I could still see ghosts but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWas amazing gift you have ... with us Julie we're going to take

Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit ... spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked to you about this for planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory\nProducer it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will\nRead the book I'm a of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want it duplicated duplicated experience yeah yeah I could handle it now you would really yeah I could but you couldn't them\nAnd it was um oh let me just tell them I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat happened I'll do it if you want me to George is with like\nAll right I'll tell him All right we have a couple of minutes yeah oh is it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody incentive is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called me and one night and said I saw\nThat man again and and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what he said\nHow her my name is wrong because I notice that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that it was not\nVery nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him I don't think it was back at that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you write that find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonist and this person's life and mine\nIs my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you\n[laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge\nI completely understand that I Am also I've become fearless\nUses the photography ... facet of that it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes with graffiti and um and

there was going to be an accident and happening in your future\nUm I've thought about that and I've asked questions about that's a really fantastic question and\nUm they you know I think well\nI think what they see because you know when you hear when there's like a a ... in spirit you have the ability to be um ... and more places in one you you have you have different views right you know when you're in a body like us\nA big dumb body you know we don't have that capability and I I I think what happened is\nThe situation started becoming that which an accident was ready to happen right like he didn't tell me this news an hour before he told me sixty seconds before so I don't think that everything is written\nYou know 'cause there's free will there's all those great things that we have the power over but it's like everything all lined up and I ain't vast when he saw it was\nGoing to happen\nAnd they're doing to protect us yes they are that's the important\nThey are there and you know spirit guide is the term I use other people like to use the you know the the word angel you can use\nGuardian angel on thirty nature\nYes you can use whatever turned me one guardian angel angel spirit guide whatever it is that you know makes you comfortable um but I I think there is power of saying that absolutely because the energy was moving in that direction and it was right there sixty

either going ha ha ha I'm a truck driver and I I'm Out here all the time I Love your show but I have a specific question or Julie sure a kind of fascinated about the checking the pitchers as that goes\nWhen you do you have a special technique protecting the pitcher do you have a feeling when you take the pitcher they can do it I take a picture of egos use or do I have to be in a certain situation is certain ah\nNo I'm I Will certainly get a feeling so that's a really great question\nDo you sit at a certain aperture on the camera shutters speed or anything like that\nIt is just my iPhone and and and the newer I harmful smoking yeah it's my iPhone I'm sure and our iPhone\nWould work as well um and\nYou just have to take off that and and and the new one now that takes like the three pictures right in a row because that um whatever that was called somebody must know what that's called um you have to turn that off I'm I'll tell you what to look for\nAnd I and I detail there's a lot in my book because I get into specificity for for people that are interested in it um for want to look for colors look for ... um purple and greens because you'll see some entities that are like that have purple and green\nI'm looking look and glass you know if you take a picture and and like if you're in your truck look you know the river there take a look at that specifically\nUm um\nI also have a lot of tips on 'em 'cause you know get their ghost right it's not like we're at an old and mills now portrait studio if they're still around if they know the oil and milk studios are\nBut they're not saying they're waiting posing to say yes and yes that picture what I find to be the most interesting thing and I can find it goes and virtually any photograph now\nAnd not even that I take that anybody takes\nAnd I'm really dying for people um that that was upon for people to send me there photographs because I flip them into negative\nAnd when you flip the picture and negative you can see things that you don't see when you first take the picture so there's like little apps called pick shop is the one I use and I'll put a photo in there and I'll just hitting negative and it just slips that\nTo the negative mode and you'll see a lot in there\nYou really do want to do probably special email for people\n[noise] um that's not a business related\nYeah you know what were you guys

emails from people saying why don't why why is that what what did we see but let's check in with Dr sky Stephen king's seeming it was unbelievable\nYou know George I envy everybody in that part of the country but it was widely seen here in Arizona and I'll be honest with the audience I missed this darn it but this gigantic what George like a jelly fish like object sky\nSure gets people's attention but what I think it's even more prolific about this and everybody across the Internet as you're saying pictures are everywhere in some really good ones what's amazing George about this to me is they replicated the same thing they did on the east coast by seeing the main booster rocket\nActually do a turnaround computer wise\nAnd then soft land back at the Vandenberg air force base location now that to me is real science and here's some scoop I think for over ... listeners will be reporting on these more so we can hopefully give everybody a launch window they're supposed to be a number of these launches from Vandenberg in November I'll do my homework and make sure we find out more\nBut George we continued with space space telescope is now out of action\nAt least for a temporary period of time it's called the safer motives these critical gyros\nAbove six main gyros use to stabilize the Hubble Space telescope it's now down to two of the three you needed to had minimum help make this

tonight fringe investigations\nSo something you know seven hundred eight hundred pounds and leave a whole\nLot deeper than it is in the mud so you know you don't think there's there's solved walking past losses\nAnd you're ... you're not going to have a tendency sasquatch leaving a quarter inch footprint that you know\nSeven eight or passages doesn't work maybe they take ballet but you never know but anyway I say that it is there's different kinds of fruit and different kinds of evidence and everyone think something that might not be you have to be the again it goes back to using scientific method\nAnd looking at all aspects\nOf the playoffs are on the ground and then it ... when the weather in the ... were you did that every time we take a track we know exactly where it was almost to the court I mean you could you yeah I mean that's how we measure we measure lane measure with that and then we always try to show you how deep it is\nAnd I think when you do something like that it's a little more scientific and just having a cat and something that you think they print but when you start looking at it in the scientific method it just doesn't pan out because it's probably put someone slips and then in Longate it and that's why it's only a quarter of an inch deep insult\nThree talented people put on the fringe investigations broadcast the first is the cryptic guy Christian McLeod Christian how how long have you ah folks been doing this\nWell George we've been doing the pot cats for about three months I'm tired and I've been together working as a team and the cryptic\nThe field for about three years and I've been doing it for about ... to myself\nIt sounds like you you folks are all having a great time doing this\nWe have a blast it it's like working with your best friends\nNow for people who want to listen to what you do how do they find you Christian\nYou can find us on fringe investigations on YouTube or fringe investigation that that I'm\nNow the second podcaster who works with the ... the guy Christian McLeod is tiny Daniel hers Daniel tell me a little bit about the podcast\nAbout this is meant to talk about a little bit of everything um we want to bring truth we want to bring fallen and just everything we can do the airways\nWell and you you're all doing a great job doing that and podcasting is just growing now isn't it\nIt is it's a huge thing there's an amazing amount of gas out there and so many good ones as well\nWhen a when you're doing your pod casting and a lot of times you go out on paranormal probes in investigating what has been for you the scariest thing you've been you've uncovered\n[noise] well uh we were in\nAn area with what we found a a stride between two for the Christian correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't at Twenty one inch is\nWhat we lost we lost one of the pond casters that's okay\nBut our third ... cat but castor is slim marina welcome your other two are still up there on the radio waves marina\nThank you yeah you know what I'm that they've made it wherever can as I tend to bring a little bit of an alternative to things and kind of next thing is that what made friends investigation from now\nOn their own in the wild card there and and like I said we take our research\nVery seriously but we did not take our stuff\nIs there a ... an episode that you had that ah you wouldn't want to repeat because it scared the living daylights out of view\nWe had a couple of times in the field um where we were in short a rental out of the woods and we got a couple of Hector than you know they never turned out and clean and they want\nYou know you always think you're prepared in that moment that you're going to be ready but you have everything you know you have experience you have the equipment and yet when it comes down to that moment that's the real fears that then\nAnd then one more time slim hotter people listen to your podcast\nAnd they can go now that that does that investigation dot com or they can

artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were in the long mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers\nOf artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that\nWill become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand\nAnd two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nA that that may be more that that may do a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could out of the airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think\nAt writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\nYou know he he's at the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working a\nHey I even the term was\nCalling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence\nWe didn't that being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can if if you out of business that can make probably any department in your business ten ten percent faster temper ... better ten percent\nMore profitable or it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nThe technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances and I\nAh we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're gonna have\nYou know more dense is uh they become a light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a a series of\nIntelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with the land mine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make ... ... it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffer gunpowder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a promise killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Korea came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled I think it's inevitable that we're going to\nFor better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a weapon systems\nIt's good to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you can argue that ah\nThe the better the more effective it their mission\nAnd there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you going to argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... or ... whatever country you are and and\nThe third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that were coming up to the top of the commercial finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars do you see the day that\nYou know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with artificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo find out where George ... speaking go to the coast to coast am dot com website scroll down to the bottom and click George ...\nPage five Ninety

there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't gonna you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that um\nBut like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence\nAn open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain that three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we we're so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and\nSometimes we learned something so big and knew that\nIt just changed the victory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it\nIf you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with the mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles\nHumans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is already Fishell intelligent you it is to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled across the person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty color maybe forty in Nineteen Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nOn the radio on the Web site id case yesterday dot com [laughter]\nOff the coast posting by the\nWhy would she goes to Yemen\nMorial coliseum before opening Dodger Stadium on April ...

interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there if you think that the way technologies progressing that we may get to that you are at the age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as working alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight pulled and real dollars and people only worked Fifteen hours and so you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go on a fault just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you can work fifty hours a week and live like you did in Nineteen thirty\nAre the people decided they wanted more and so

devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a\nFix my road probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ...

appropriately comprehensive after the investigation concluded the White House and Republican lawmakers said it didn't corroborate the allegations justice Kevin ... of course has denied them\nJudge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court gets chief justice John Roberts a historic opportunity to lead a firmly\nConservative court but it also presents a considerable challenge for chief justice tasked with steering through national political turbulence that threatens to chip away at the courts legitimacy it's a story by Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall Brent what's up here\nJohn Roberts is the man in the middle of the Supreme Court both are\nLiterally and figuratively so you know he he leads to ... the face of the federal judiciary and now after Justice Kennedy retired it the way the ideological breakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so we are here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative than it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law but as we say and the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee parents and\nThe whole process just isn't that sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for that she will be to to try to steer the court through these meeting are pretty rough partisan times without also just looking like another part if somebody you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean it was rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\nWell I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll\nKind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't it's not so sweeping so that's one way to to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times and on on issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so you know that the calculation he will have to make another another question for the court\nAnd there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have a choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to talk about it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear\nSo you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example meet in the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now ... all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process they have some visibility for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat as Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's\nIs probably easily the most recognizable member of the court for the public off the bench and you know that\nPeople have in our proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get\nBack to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time any any way some of this dies down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strong conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate in the end to forge common ground with you know with a cross section of people in the court and then maybe slowly that that sort of makes things a little better for him\nIt's Brent that's

people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happen and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr juice or law\nPsychiatry and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly empathic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness at into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of an accident and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed\n[laughter] and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize\nThat you're not them that your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's sunny and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system in the mirror\nNeurons are the compassion neurons in the brain for I'm I'm past too that's why it's such an interesting kind of trust and an impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle urine mirror neurons get activated but much more so and highly empathic people\nSo how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or ... something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I'd suggest all light impact patients has to take news fast you know and not become addicted to the news\nBecause if you have that constant onslaught of stress and negative news\nIt's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature um meditate exercise ... a friend and laugh so that's one tool but also just notice it past traumas\nUm triggered for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident\nNo your pain about losing your father's triggers so you have to know that different though that that could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is in addition to the current situation [noise] um and also doing a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're\nYou know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to meditate go outside um learn now is a complete sentence with paper because then you don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no no it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be around energy vampires will I write about they're destroying your energy\nFor we're speaking with Dr juice or off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York in which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all the stress from other people's tragedy calls himself a long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely an impasse here don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book had become a guard they never want to go outside they had panic disorders they can have physical disease is a lot of the decisions because there are sensory overload all the time off\nOr they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it\nAnd so yeah I Believe the empathy is a trait that's going to save the world I really do I feel so strongly about it is something I teach all my patients how to develop\nUm and it has to be laughing to be able to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from the first step to healing is he so we need to have empathy but we don't need to take on the suffering of the world", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "09"}
