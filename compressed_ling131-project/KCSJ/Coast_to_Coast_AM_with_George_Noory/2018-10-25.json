water gruesome\nSalt water mixed with you know it's so amazing it's just that so many things but it really just\nClears that our our energy or aura right everything that we have anything lodged and everything we picked up from others it can also clear our own negative thoughts\nAnd you know everyone has negative thoughts that are created on a daily basis\nSubconsciously so the salt water pretty much just clears gives you a good clean up the ...\nWhy does or Kurdish work\nWhy does a curse work that good question occur works [noise] ah because we allow it to work for a number of curse cannot work if we um [noise] it's our minds you know the power if\nI mean is is that the person putting the ... the the job or is it the recipient who some of what should happen\n[noise] it's the recipient that's a very good question yes the recipients always a recipient that let that happen and you know most nine times out of ten I'm it's because our our ... are not intact and I don't think I've met anyone with an tacked ara but it's both and\nIt can also be comic it can be comic curse it can be comic now doesn't mean that you have to accept it because if you have learned you know you you say God or turn the gods radius ended masters or the angels and if you make it very clear that you no longer want this to be part of your experience\nYou know you can really do something like an crossing and I'm released it from European but it's both but it\nBoils down to the person who is the\nTarget it's usually are mines that are not as strong as they can be\nBut it is possible for each and every one of us to to have a very very very very very powerful mind and when that happens person can affect us we'll just bounce off\nLet's go to the Rockies Charlotte in Pennsylvania ... go ahead\nHi Charlotte I for thanks for taking my call or my question is how does\nOne heal themselves how when he'll want to know that much I just recently heard about that is that something you can do to yourself absolutely merging has always always got\nTo explain ...\nOkay this is just um like he does you get the bundled up stage and you light the stage and I prefer just to stage when I make it so right at it after a hot bath I should've said that before and I didn't um you just said and between your legs\nAnd you'll stage all around your body mostly around your head and especially behind your head because that's where entity like two to hang out\nI'm so every crevice in your body just going to stage um and it works if you do it forty days in a row if you said your house and you said yourself you definitely will fill a difference\nOh I Hope that works for your Charlotte Allen in Fresno, California is with us now why yell and go ahead\nI Would go and buy a lot of the question um how do you do get rid of stairs in your how\nHow do you get rid of the earth great question going to have to email me for that because it's going to be more lengthy um I can give you um information on how to do a house exercises um now what kind of spirits I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know whether you wake up in the morning what how how serious are these\nWhat's happening around it's like it's like I'm I wake up in the middle of the night and like teachers clicking noises people talking and then when I go like into the closet no one's there\nOkay so you probably have ... what is known as a a called an earth bounce spirit so it can be someone\nThat's like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not like a theme and it's probably just as maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nAnd is it possible would curse or that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit that are just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked it and there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nDown and wanted me by black magicians which were written on edition or a group that\nI Know I'm Sorry I didn't clarify a magician and it can actually send you an earth bounce spirit and what they do is they will go and I'm\nLooking for spirit at the cemetery who have an crossed over and they will um make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send a spirit to you and if that happens actually quite frequent\nAre they under the control of Lucia per Satan [noise]\nThe dark lord\nI absolutely they are definitely in the dark lord exists\nBecause when you should somebody sends them that's who I think is sending them\nWell it depends because always the the evil magicians are definitely being manipulated by the dark lord and and you know other demon so in a in a in a sense yes absolutely\nYou've got to watch out you got to watch our ...

packages intercepted Wednesday of the Washington DC area in New York and later in Los Angeles federal\nYou do in a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with it and we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom Dan highs or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight I'm\nA I pick the people that\nThe audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the shows to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to tricky aren't really creative I remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not guess him at all he had you and I think\nIn honey and was going to\nEven even when he was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three gas will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nA in this nine will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes next Wednesday Halloween Night or you're putting together a number of uh email ghost stories from people and will have the actual people on the year with me that night\nUh and of course we'll take calls from our listeners to with ghost stories so we're ready to go there\nReady to go is shaping up to be a fun show we're going to honor\nOkay Thanks Tom okay so let's open up the first secret doors\nActually I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd I mean I you know and\nOh boy this is gonna be tough I'm fine how are you\nWell my and my first ... days not oh I Know I got older things get tough for\nIts Stanton reading and more hits Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed I guess [laughter]\nI I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell or it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to ... to me I hunger\nAnd yes you are an ID we need we need you on this program my friend when I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and these of January November and December I Can't believe it two months of outgoing and they wear\nA against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your standard I going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw little slipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr an uncle in university and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder out I went ... interviewed stamps and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field of view ... these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nThe latest word against it looks like they're about one point six planets per star opera galaxy starred in our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion star\nAll that means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place and you know that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special\nYou know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course we're not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd lead funnier room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know getting here from there is not quite the big deal we used to think was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're fusion for example you can get\n... or we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a visual mushroom part of the world was created in four thousand B. C.\nThat's right can't be too late beings around you know well it was off a little bit four billion base [laughter]\nThey are just the little the little uh our\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her ...\nUm we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place out whether this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere on migration colonization maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that are very throwing some of that they put in incarcerated people\nYou know like yeah like a personal ad boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's really stand to you or one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide\nBut in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about with you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of river expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for star so like like a huge number of planets and [noise]\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand flights you know if there are life out there and we see it\nMhm you know they would make contact and the White House\nLawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people money's coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us will learn that if\nThe more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know we're not the most advanced and much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of land and the stars and things like that\nAnd uh hey we're not number ... ... oh no [laughter] no and so what we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind eye it's about a trillion dollars this year\nOr so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow all the\nPeople don't get the goodies of are on their work uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is and I'm not going to try to explain why or how but we know enough to say that it's a it's\nAn awful lot of energy available to men universe and you know gone to the sequence of I you know uh how long does it take to get someplace how ... person in on almost kind of stuff and\nGood to have to work at it\nOr they're bad things in the world of course I'm sure we can do something and so why shouldn't I be in the um and\nLike I say restraint seems to be the word the uppermost than many leaders mine recognition if I get them don't get good at why\nWhy don't we hear too much about a abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted that there is ... or maybe we haven't talked to any leader\nOr maybe they stopped\nYeah maybe they got all in the raccoon up enough\nAnd it might not be surprising I I have a great deal of enemy of gets pushed and ...\nUsed to restrain the life of a nuclear weapons around and using them and I'm pleased about it because then they also use energy to move more constructive direct [noise] 'cause I think [noise]\nUm my grandson will grow up in an age where there is in Iraq\nRight I sure hope you you're right about that stand we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with you in just a moment we'll take phone calls stepson fried been with us his website is

with a former vice presidents name on it\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait and get the official verdict from our authorities and the intelligence communities\nIn the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked but\nWe have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as\nYour enemy as an opponent yes but\nNot an enemy we're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely 'cause George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears\nAs you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the

going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this\nIt won't ever did this whether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false\nFlag it'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut out wait let the intelligence officials do there\nJob then wants their job is completed and they determine who's done this then we can begin as a nation\nTo try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in

out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nThe latest word began looks like they're about one point six climates per star not bring galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion star\nAll that main one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changed as our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know getting here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that uh you know it's got to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we're ... we're using for example or it can get\n... or we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created in four thousand B. C.\nThat's right it can be hilly beings around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be seen as\nThey are just a little the little uh our\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say that as people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her ...\nUm we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place out whether this is a result them spontaneous\nGeneration of life everywhere on migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that a very thorough so that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a personal ad boy guys and brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's really stand to you or one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so I guess like a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand flights you know if there are life out there and we see it mhm you know they would make contact them on the white\nHouse lawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than ... ...\nDo people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place and we but\nMakes us less important than we'd like to think we are and there are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped\n[laughter] and and so uh what\nMost of us have learned that if it's more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of land and the stars and things like that and\nUh hey we're not number all oh no [laughter] no and\nSo what we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind eye it's about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that it'll have people don't get the goodies of are\nOn their work uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is and\nI'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that ah\nThere's an awful lot of energy available to men universe and you know gone to the sequence of I you know uh how long does it take to get someplace how ... the nearest person on almost kind of stuff and\nShe the universe crowded a you know it takes a while to get here and there you don't get on your bicycle and go to the next door [laughter]\nAnd none of them the venues that's remarkable\nIt is shown restraint I'm saying that makes us great guy but it's the first step toward good sense to restrain from using all the killing tools about helping to ... so I I'm an optimist George you always have been\nWhy not why it was good at math to work at it\nOr they're bad things in the world of course I'm sure we\nCan do something that ... and so why shouldn't I be in the um and like I say restraint seems to be the word the uppermost than many leaders mine recognition if I get them they'll get to go to white [laughter]\nWhy don't we hear too much about abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted that there is ... or maybe we put your turkey\nLeaders or maybe they ... yeah maybe like at all and me raccoon up\nEnough and might not be surprising me\nI I have a great deal of fake ... gets pushed

eight teams have shifted their Trump Arab political allegiance is more than Nevada senator Dean Heller Mr Hitler never endorsed President Trump's twenty sixteen campaign but his Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein says then Trump Arab political facts of life intervened read what do we have\nDean Heller in twenty six team but he was Ninety nine percent against Trump a he has been a sort of moderate senator Republican senator from a swing state uh and it was kept his distance during the campaign and then even during the first several months of the president's administration in our\nState away from Trump he opposed to it at a press conference in Las Vegas a in June of twenty Seventeen and said he could not support a Republican health care overhaul\nAnd shortly after that a guy he got a primary challenger and his his political outlook turned it became a big Trump supporter big supporter of the president's a judicial nominees uh and then\nWe saw this weekend in at a rally in Nevada\nHe compared the president can lightest and said everything he touches turns to gold\nShe's right so the primary challenger was from tortellini incorrect\nWas from Danny Tarkanian the son of the famous basketball code right number cherry Tarkanian coach the uh the run rebels are you at all the uh his son Danny as a\nSomething of a perennial candidate and the Vatican's runs seven times and in that winning for different officers but he has a base of support\nIn the conservative wing of the Republican Party and he lost the Senate campaign a primary against our last summer with the idea that senator Heller walking loyal enough to the president because these are in almost instantly within a few days\nWe saw Dean Heller react to it by revealing for the first time that he voted for the president and twenty sixteen something that he ... to that point refused to say out loud\nAnd he backed the the second attempt to Republican healthcare attempt\nA and then he put himself out front on judges that I'm a I'm a tax bill than your act both the president signed last December and since then he's been a sort of a big supporter of the party and the president has responded in kind\nOf this weekend was the trip a that he's made to Nevada to campaign with senator Heller since June and senator has clearly made the bat that the way to win re election in twenty eight team is uh to be seen as a very tight with the question\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is ... it's called an advantage GOP senator bets on his conversion to Trump is him talking about the incumbent Republican Dean Heller or to use it as sort of began in the primary versus fellow Republican Danny Tarkanian then\nUh it's continued now in the general election against a congresswoman Jacky Rosen the Democrat\nWell Jacky Rosen is a a democratic member of Congress running against the power and she is making the argument that Dean Heller a has no principle of their own she's called him senator spineless and TV ads or\nWherever Dean Heller holds events a Jacky Rosen campaign shows up with one of those sort of inflatable two men like you see a car dealership with a sort of a big way they are a flying around in the wind\nThat they are essentially you're guessing that our\nTrips and the wind and that he uh has changed his mind on a number of policies that much so much critical health care to suit President Trump and his supporters and that senator Heller jak euros now that can't be counted on to make decisions and the best teachers in Nevada but that that's so odd to police questioned Trump's\nGrow All right so how has the conversion paid off what what are the poll say about that race\nWith a it's one of the closest raped within the country are both sides now say that
