the new consciousness movement she's the author of several read books including the field and the intention experiment underway does the power\nOf age limits the editorial director what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when several weeks ago a Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could you know the category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about six piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence and the violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yeah ...\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at it from the University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up at St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what a people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purify water the healing somebody of ... to lowering violence and you\nKnow of the thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case is thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow maybe he'll think the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras in nine different locations\nAnd we had the cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the nine one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arab we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play in in the ship your upbeat and positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide it through self off of forty foot structure after\nIs he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had a you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks\nWhile his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot jar ah Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist and a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from U. of Penn State university water expert\nUm I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's miserable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nWe sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nYou know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the trash why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will tell me really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nI was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really done many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's what I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young\nSo we set up a group of students\nAnd we put a ... D G kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one center in each of the group and what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of static one and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like uh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks any static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a Supreme after my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was a twelve minute video for me\nI was to do when we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work the power of each and\nSome of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable when Mick Jagger ... linked up for you that coast to coast day I'm ... dot com sober other books the blonde the intention experiment and\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com\n\n\n[noise]\n\nRadio on the weather like dining\nOut to fight back the\nTo coast yeah crystal at\nPublic river walk dot org the event starts at four o'clock on October twenty seven and ends at eight o'clock\nWhich will be done before it gets too cold in case we do have cold weather on the twenty twenty six to seven twenty seven\nDay yeah yeah and the other part of that is\nWe have boats renting 'em all through the month of October on Friday Saturday there's going to be um several different categories and it'd be a zero to chew three to six seven to twelve and then there's going to be a family costume contests I'm really excited to see who comes and\nDoes that but I think the cutest part of it is going to be sent me and said she will be there they're also helping put this event on and all of their customers will be down with their furry friends in costume to so be sure to bring the whole family including here for a\nJudge a judge has to dress up or over a drawn down so lately some once again if you need details\nJust email me at crystal ... river walk dot org or you can call her off at\n...

the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this [noise]\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that\nWe um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be that would be an interesting for\nWill you know we're doing one this at this Sunday on doing a ...\nPilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward and we're planning to roll down in a\nBig way next next spring um we're we want people you know I'm a different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nUs talk about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror affect me with the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing effects among the receivers and stuff\nAnd the receivers of the big intention experiment you know the outcome the biggest change all that was amazing to me with what happened to the participants in these intention experiment so when\nWe started giving these these experiments I started getting people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the website and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked him how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who were participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment their lines became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect\nAnd when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to the people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen

me today so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announced near it cost to production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nWith the times silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible dial\nShore in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal the half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels they're just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces at over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced reaches all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate about anything that you can set up to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George or to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high so report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts these over rising to a hundred dollars announced\nThe reporter the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred two Ninety nine Seventy four hundred and one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas in nuclear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in so fascinating report it don't miss out on the ... revolution call now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation goal one\nEight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nThis online banks for closing on how they even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what a nightmare\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on in life where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you have in your home like this police officer\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title walk and discovered some faith had already taken over title thank God I found out of time\nWhen we have a prayer session on Fridays for listeners who need help and it seems to work\n[noise] absolutely I mean we have had the most amazing experiences with our intentions of the week um we just had\nA woman a coat Chrissy who needed a I'm a she needed a stem cell transplant for bone cancer and she'd the doctors didn't think that she was going to produce enough\nStem cells for this we did a big intention four and she got out of the hospital with amazing amounts of stem cells in record time we just had another guy who had just south of cancer\nHe's just been given the all clear\nAnd even the people who participate we had another woman who was developing arthritis in your hands and bite she did the intentions of the week for other people week after week after week and her arthritis completely cleared\nJust like that just like that\nLet's go to ... we just went to Greg each well by the way we did have that caller right before the break wanted to know what to do about his pain remember that\nYeah um I think the best thing George is get a powered group a power beat group together\nAnd as I say if he if he doesn't have seven friends they can come on my Web site\nLimit ... dot com forward slash for them and just come on the forum and set up a group or a virtual group or joined an existing group in their time zone but I think he should do a power the group\nUm and we have a lot of great affects the people who have that kind of pain or of head injuries from playing sport\nOkay next up let's go to Charles in ...

only for the cases that region but also for being a pipeline to the Supreme Court more from Lydia wheeler legal affairs reporter at the hill Lydia what's up here\nThe DC circuit court of appeals is this a really in court on it's known not only for the case of that region but also the career short trajectory of though to get on the bench and it's known as the second most powerful court in the country and it has had a a majestic on let's say justice\nBut Justice John Roberts Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nOr Justice Clarence Thomas in the late Justice Antonin Scalia all offended by the gate to the Supreme Court\nAs well or some of the names are being floated right now with potential replacements for capital\nA bike so my sources are telling me that this administration is going to look for somebody who really skate and administrative law\nOn because this is a court adheres and kind of regulatory challenges choose to regulation that the federal agency issue as well as separation of powers issues to basically at hand or anything and that that are any of the uh\nAdministration's actions that are being challenged it was the case of that here\nAt my church that they're actually saying that\nAt Trump's regulatory thought a male new route could be on the shortlist and she is the administrator at the White House out that the information and regulatory affairs and she'd been instrumental in helping Trump I needed and cutting down regulation\n... speaking with Lydia wheeler legal affairs reporter at the hills you get a piece called Trump spaces new decision on second most powerful court talking about the DC circuit court of appeals were\n... capital left when he joined the Supreme Court how eager by the way with the Trump Administration would be to build this is this something or is it a race against the clock so you head of the November midterms\nI don't know how quickly and they're going to look to that kind of been a little bit slower um I can get them their main focus was on the Supreme Court and now that that's gone and we haven't heard anything yet they haven't seen yet or nominate anybody\nAnd they're not sure how quickly will see that and you know they thought that was the question of if they get put them on the head of the term and whether or not there than it would have time to get them can harm gets liquid unlikely that they would uh because uh all the senators will be leaving and I took it back to their home states on to get ready for the midterm uh so\nYou know and then we have you know what happened and then in terms could could really shake up that seat and because that could be held open for a long time especially if the Democrats take control the Senate\nAnd the euro too that the the DC circuit court differs from other federal appeals court in the types of cases that here's how come explain that\nWeight that this is a court medics recovery and it has a special responsibility upbringing rockets challenging federal government action than decision and that means every dog constitutional question involving separation of power issues and challenges and we're making\n'em so you know it kind of any time like an agency action challenged go directly to that caller\nAre good and it's the the balance right now at least a politically\nWould be what is it like seven Democrats three appointed by Republican something like that\nThat that is right that that is a a a a court that is most of it stretch it had been appointed by Democrats\nAnd Jeffrey cabin on was a a a Republican appointee I mean keep moving on taking on the Supreme Court though his replacement um who would likely be nominated\nBy Trump would be another conservative judge so whoever replaces them either going to change the ideological balance of the court anyway it's a one conservative for another day now and just kind of waiting to see what who the administration decides to attack\nAnd then also kind of throw their hat in Iran I think at the same thing that I think of their struggles are going to be paying attention to 'em and could and could get more attention moving or just because the court influence from instrumental and I don't think people realize I'm the type of our\nHow instrumental really is um all of 'em a special prosecutor on Robert Mueller's investigation on all those charges that make a ... investigation will be handled
