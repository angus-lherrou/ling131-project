back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and in the dreams develop\nA top most for says mentions and in illustrates to being says there and desert box just tweeted\nThe pay for that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast am on the street there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the top\nNow with your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nUm ah the review or a who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we were my paper or he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses\nAnd as you get to the top of the courses get dinner but\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story Greek government how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John Paul will fall and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to opinions he's in the back of the book where he explains the theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the sticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps that every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you could just you know simple mindedly I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed pyramids with uh something called they called they set that which is the purely to angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how the conceptual eyes a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's low regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that are decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension that\nWhich which to me I Want it to correct something I said in the fate to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a sharp tooth and effect we published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't an arcade into big tipper\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part\nOf the of the big tipper and we are we why the pyramids ended up in that in the north south uh orientation do\nI gotta jump in right there this is coast to coast and we got to take a break my new this ... murals to return we'll be right

coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of publish papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers or with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for\nThese must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing and you're right I'm I'm I'm this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these ... or or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were round number fractious of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nI'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these well fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that it seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is a round number facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces\nAnd work but nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at six if not and\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yet you need to have if you are going to a proposed these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example a course on the Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth and Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the you know ... that uh that guard the entry of the great pyramid show right that that\nCosts them at Twenty one is right under the\nSo it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round facts of the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and then twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be\nA you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys I got in ... yes yes of course we don't know exactly\nWhich is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give us off guard\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from ...\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go back a little tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising\nRight all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go ... not an accident\nNo within references of course with the lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nL O ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry that yours\nGo back ... Kathy\nYou like that my news you liked that area [laughter] okay I\nAm a day or I always love hearing is that all that it may have more do you play so great for me they gave the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick joke about their armored Tyler just at\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so uh as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from ... a king scorpions\nAnd that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt or probably from Bhutto and brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with the with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up perhaps\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa maybe you know with the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south in that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds to ... the Greeks adapting the etymology chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned is getting so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were think it was the lioness and her name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here

I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved a opposite force at by a if you put\n'em you know I think they're sort of mixed\nBack here you know there's the public's eye of us who you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientist you archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it at all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that uh you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that is why are they going to have to open right are are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so to the to the listeners question I think I forgot was Daniel I think right yes um yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has\nChanged uh they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know a Fayette they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more by new when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\nThe\nHe\n\nMoved to ease\nThe five Ninety cheesiest dot com were\nThey were being what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nThink for decorating the house or just setting the theory mood\nOwn means might be played as Neal tracks with labor in my life and we've got\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people were bowlers Joe Rogan experience all your music all your favorite\nRandy\nProtecting that investment is a big responsibility if you live in a condominium or homeowners association you need to think about how your community association is managed by maybe ...

while now let's go to the first time caller line Skoda Isaac in Toronto Isaac you're up next time cos Adam I knew\nI knew I Know\nThis is a great show was just trying to go to one show which is the language or\nIt was you can ... or you can get a looming of a tough sell\nA which is a believe a ... a lot of them for a living doing this for quite some time [noise] [noise] oh sorry about it a little\nOkay so I think oh well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is uh the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\n... to ... of the ... to ... trip to but the word of the meaning of the pro which it's originated from the push language\nBut push language reaches a cush replied by going to buy toilet five hundred years ago\nOr ... or ... as the you know we're talking about a quiet of three thousand four thousand years ago\nIt's been ... older than any other language you can put 'em in a little bowl opponent show cushion language was\nOf people who is this big law it's the push people still you know origin bag loan which I'm from the ... which is do you think like\n... there's been a little late it was a new people along the pilot or\nThe ... you know heighten or somewhere in the ... in the world\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute\nThe origins of the word Barrow and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't buy some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are saying that are in the old kingdom or that term was not use\nSo determined pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think\nFirst ah I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears and that's all I Know about it offhand\nI read I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were when we're going back\nTo a man is a um\nAnd in the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings yeah\nRight like ... and meant is uh the first uh teachings of Egypt could be some are saying the same a menace ... may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called Barrows\nBack then right and now there's another ah ah I have\nResearch that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the ... people were the original Egypt ... and the the ... center there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh\nBy the fifth dynasty the king had five different titles um and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse king so it was horse in the armor\nAnd horse or a ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a campaign you know the designation or next to invent which is basically referring to operate or Egypt and then came the two lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later\nUm but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up and I was like four hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies let's go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on

ready to a head straight back to it that Stewart let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that ... referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah with an alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I I watched this documentary uh which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham and cook\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it well\nLet me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top ... there'll be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\n... as well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... vowed has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not up to her media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it um\nNow you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big could that chamber be\nI think a a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by\nEight hide I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph gun to bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not all be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it to me is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies it seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing\nThe the plates and throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any

[noise]\nAlright welcome back to the coast to coast am beautiful Monday morning here in Southern California\nAnd like I said my favorite thing to research my favorite is loss history and Egypt and our guest tonight my new safe side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers over on his website Chiapas pyramids\nA dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now my new before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seem to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened\nIn Egypt after Cleopatra and we had that ah example of it but it was going on before a you know she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this last week on my other show fade to black which is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years I'm On this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original things was built then you double that entire time period one more time and more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because ah ... as grand man cook a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and uh the only thing that survive or how about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one which is a you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has an Asia and the UC the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I\nJust had such a profound impact on me that movie um and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible my here with a with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are I and let's go wild card it's good to Dorothy in Carmichael, California Dorothy you're up next on coast\nHa ha ha I'm okay with me and he can ... ... hope that they can and cannot\nFind suitable for all our credit he had heart in our own like a ...\n... ah\nHe kind of ... in it that way it is hard to defend that in mind and he knew um\nOkay ... ... it ... the I think when they can then maybe you could recreate mom model if there was like a\n... and they hit the kids or you know found and we had something like ... in the ad in the night but he never tell the truth that getting ready to get it there you know while they had kind of thing how\nAre you talking about the Winchester House here in California\nYeah remember her heroin has built on all the facts and they go get confused with his father and you know he kind of life there at the end but she had in mind that went nowhere [laughter]\nYeah and the spirits would get lost\nIn there and get right and now I Know that and it it is they can\nAnd maybe they ... you know they wanted the oil because they do that\nAnd they have a rat and maybe that's a great day when it's ten minutes okay and how well they're not because of the year for a long time than that now that are in the navy\nBut so when you go to other cultures that could be completely different it could actually you know you see a picture of a bird and that is what was meant to be said so um so I so it's a great question and I just wanted to emphasize that point phonetic versus pick their graphics script or that's probably the first question you should ask yourself\nAnd and you can read hieroglyphics can't you\nYeah I I I started learning a and and I have to acknowledge a gym Allen even amazing teacher or he published a books about Egyptian grammar and I used as books and he's so well it's so well written that you can actually teach yourself so I'm self taught\nAnd I maybe early or intermediate at this stage and uh it goes to his credit or I mean probably among the most well written text books I've ever read and that includes all the textbooks I had to read it medical school or the one by Jim Alan it's really well written\nAnd let's go to one of the Rockies Arnie in Roseville, California out here on the west coast harm to Europe next\nUh yeah Hi out first to comment on the um [noise] a health and\nThe medicine of the early ... and then in a society from all amateurs ... of the remains and ah of the workers as well as the ... and everything [noise]\nMost of them than live more than thirty to forty years old so I have a hard time believing the medicine was really kind of pick are really a\nMan I don't know if you have any comments on that but I uh even the pharaohs\nI think there was one that lived to be eighty almost eighty but most of them die didn't or forties at ... ...\nWell I we have actually so that's a great question so I'm the worker village a you know ... a southern south ... uh where mark leaner has been a excavating a they find actually workers that have a they broke a bone and it was split that\nI'm so they were performing ... you know surgeries are on on these workers when they injure themselves which goes to show\nThat there were not being abused or they were probably voluntary workers and uh they were being well fed and there will be taken care of so um yes the lifespan was definitely shorter than ours but\nThere are if you look at if you go to Cairo Museum UC statues of people there were definitely the older than thirty or forty look at him he would've statue you know the person that I think designed the great pyramid\nUm he probably had diabetes from the looks of it and he was kind of heavy set you know he probably had a ... in the legs but to me he looks maybe fifties maybe even sixties\nYou know so it's kind of depends\nOne last call let's go to Mike in St Peters Missouri last call of the night Mike welcome\nOh hi I'm always wondering uh the pyramid itself that we see their goal is that all of it or is there like another mile underground you know that just like the tip of the iceberg\nThere you go my new is the ... well aside from the just sending passage\nWay to the lower chamber is any of that pyramid underground\nA ... I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg ah\nOkay that's a great question so I'm a you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lot civilization starting something ... and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically\nTo draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right\nYes so um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk that's not human stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of\nYou know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and they were aligned to you know the belt stars for Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom are Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks\nMuch older and when you walk into the red pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight here on coast yeah I loved\nIt thank you so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left you know what's next for you\nUm what are your ... one of your listeners asked exactly the right question about the connection between a go Beckley taffy and or in Egypt and that's that's what's next\nAnd there's no doubt that there is a connection I there's a seven thousand year gap in there\nAnd we're going to feel it in and ... with your help thank you so much Manu they\nSay out there seems to what a conversation tonight this is one coast to coast was all about for me is being able to come in here and discussed my favorite thing which is loss history and each of course time travel goes\nUFOs all of that stuff counts too but for me it is Egypt and loss history\nAnd would that I got to get out a year\nSo I'll see everybody here in a couple of weeks but before I Do that I've got to think Nathan running the board of course Donald behind the glass\nChris for being the producer for me here lax Greg him leases deputy George my beautiful wife Rita with that I'm your host Jimmy church spent coast to coast am I'm signing off go back to lead to be\nI mean I've gone [noise]\n[laughter]\nWhat's the news today on the free our radio a radio\nA perfect for decorating the house or just setting the scary mood [laughter] our minds he played has joke tracks with labor in my lifetime we've\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people were bowlers balk at the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nBy radio\nIn that moment in movie credit says no animals were harmed in the making this film director I rely on the eight decades of experience and brings safeguarding animal survives the locations training veterinary care so much more\nAs a director nothing is more important than making sure everyone has said\n\nFor my autos news dependable accurate\nBalanced\nFive Ninety Casey as J. argue radiolab\n[noise]\nTensions continue between the U.S in Saudi Arabia I man Carrick Fox News at questioned the fate of missing journalist Fox's Cornel Scott\nThere was virtually no information anywhere on the temples on piracy on ...

there are coast to coast am it is ... pyramid dot com you can click on it\nAnd I would like to welcome but the first time to coast to coast am my news safe side a ... minute good evening\nHello Jimmy how are you good happy birthday\nOh thank you so much and that was a lot of the audience know that was a few days ago last week but ah ah I Do we have you we had you on my other show on my birthday did way\n... well that was built to put on a and I was the day before\nOh that's right that's right yeah yeah thank you to everybody out there for the birthday wishes and I'll just let everybody know I hit the double nickel I didn't think I'd ever get here but I mean I it's a I hit the double nickel\nWell I'm I'm I'm a year past that if I can tell you only get better\nYeah I Know I Know I really you know it it's so funny my new uh I Would have been in my life\nOr in the fund that I've had a a growing up that uh fifty five seemed like forever right in the future I didn't think I'd ever get here but I don't feel any different than when I was when I Wish I had the brain that I have now when I was Twenty one it would have been [laughter] would\nHave been a whole different story but minute let me ask you let let's let's start off a pretty directly um you're a dermatologist\nYeah and how how did you get into where you are today working with you know guys like Robert shocking Robert ... ball and now you're one of the a leading Egypt colleges type researchers in the world right now you've\nYou've really done well for yourself but but what got you here\nYeah this is a you know this is one of those things you look back and it's just incredible sometimes you just you know you you are you take a moment and if you ask yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then uh years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and ah and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um\nAnd and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I started a you know communicating and I've met\nA Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert ... a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years\nThe way to ... um you know fifth century but you know this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he described it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the particle and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up the box but\nYou would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just too confusing is the great things we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream still up between the part of the things that he used to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small\nReference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it\nOn and so that's the dream still at the image towards the ... all the other hand it's very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... ... what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name Cooper's the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the mentors the likes of very under critically with ... came to the ... things already existed in fact it was broken your heritage and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Newt so\nOkay

S. T. dot com gene wearing those to those am [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I ... church it's the great pyramid all my ... be more we get to the great pyramid\nOur guest is my new said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory ... and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and end the dreams della a top most the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things is there\nThe pay for that minute published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nLike on my news website over a ... salmon to take history there there are elusive papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different sickness in stone and take us through that\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nUm ah the review or a who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we reviewed my paper\nAh he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get\nHidden or bought every once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks how a rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these creepy courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten a originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John ... vow and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or academia a page and it's also in costs me gloom\nAnd uh his brother will too and he sees in the back of the book where you explains the theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peak and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is that every twelve is there some kind of ...\nYou know that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I\nI'm I was just struck me when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you were you just you know simple minded I thought that they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed pyramids with something called they called ... which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nThat's how the conceptual eyes a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's no regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with bases inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that earth decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I Want it to correct something I said in a state to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty

... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know and you would\nI've tried to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monument\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meeting that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological uh within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments\nLining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham and cook\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYeah well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before it's on a\nDrop off of our has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak it was basically a virtual top and a and it would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or in others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it um\nNow you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined at roe one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI acting so\nHow big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet or something like that five feet by eight Hi I'm saying right or maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that um and they would be\nIt would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stacked up um they could\nBe you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph gun to bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and fire investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the northeast corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies it seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing\nThe the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any effort excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know if you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this you're spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and ... that's the kind of money that will need for a project like that\nThis is coast to coast am I going to be church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going into Monday morning more with my news said Sunday after this short break stay with us

economies more sustainable but it can be a long path Wall Street journal reporter John camp made a couple of visits to the region John what you see\nIt can be hard for any town or city with a big employer shuts down but the shock waves are\nParticularly strong when you're talking about places that in some cases what purpose built of towns to serve this one industry while you know and the prime example was no knock it man which is a fairly remote town I'm up in central Maine deep in the woods and\nIt was a place that was really tethered very strongly to a huge meal there for a century\nAnd there was a time when people coming out of high school and say they they pretty much had guaranteed jobs there and it was a way of life and it was really the heartbeat of town for for generations\nAnd it was also really the only game in town that they get paid most towns taxes it provided also the jobs and bad mouth shut down for a decade ago and that the town that was very badly by that population shrank\nAnd the town had to lay off a lot of employees they under was close to bankruptcy and they're trying to pull out of that dive right now I got some other things going but that was certainly a really major shock\nAnd hearts of who's doing what now 'cause I there was at least a one guy and I think captured maybe what others are thinking that's you know I'd rather have a what ten employers hiring fifty people then one employer hiring five hundred\nWell that's a very common ...\nAll around me and all of these towns because they think they realize that there's danger and being a one horse out it's great when you have that one big male employing hundreds or even ... workers and you know paying most town taxes but\nObviously it's dangerous when you have all your eggs in one basket in that basket is taken away so what the towns are trying to do\nIs rebuild but we're really trying to help small economic wins and they realize that that's a long road it's not easy to do but the hope
