{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "That's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this\nI'm much more difficult to social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe ... I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff and and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge them I think there's going to be fact I think states like California is a whole\nU.S Coast or the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument in its argument in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the sole thing you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell ya I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got it or it's ... it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global his\nLaw you know here we have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally taught and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand points reversal from down nine hundred to upper eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not good to win reelection I was just going to say and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or at best Trump holes on and noticed that there were going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing path\nNext to the end of next year but there is there is a fifty fifty chance of happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFor forty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest ... was the only stock market it violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back\nUp even but it's still violated but the U.S markets looked like the ... going to open up two to three hundred points them are now that minor compared to fourteen hundred points over just the last\n... stay with us we're going to

grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within the can you predict or five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation when they were predictable we spent and when they would stop spending ... what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season it started in two thousand will be over probably about two thousand twenty two for stocks\nA two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two twenty three way in two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the difference\nThis is George is that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the orange or does it\nReal estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we just for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be has to be in the next year that\nThat it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and that makes people angry as we're seeing now an even worse this time\nAnd then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now\nThey also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise] so so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand and eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nA head of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and worked in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not in the lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricanes struck him because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here uh in New York former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing truth civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example ah and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives that chance\nAnd and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck\nDumb because of liberal democratic policies uh we're having now I'm going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nYou know just the one advantage we it is there's there is no counter bailing power that can really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be long before we were so I think that's kind of a good thing in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing powers have how you're going to we're going to definitely\nA political huge political jeez this trade war we said it's zero hour before this became obvious this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some more but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political would trade wars and\nThings like right here each there were those were coming back for final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast they\nGet

E. R. dot com\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and got may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTo thousand eerie I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nIn a ... you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people\nInstead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or the you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good\nWell hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank's name I Can't just now but I'm taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite and the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to X procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with the ridden Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nOkay thank you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my questions but before I ask that\nA direct them I Can't even apply in my mind I'm liking how are you moving humble combat yeah ... ...\n... you know what all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my guiding the looming comic um how can I tell you that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nI mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger town and more affluent people\nFirst I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario in bank insurance does agree that they can insured deposits\nAnd they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out a few pounds and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting so those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people going to hit on the positive Iceland went down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money and a\nProtected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't\nWatch those reserves and well that's a good thing

inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nDoctors bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he told by Haitians and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPot stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I\n\n[noise] in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many veterans that that um you know it's been a lot of ... about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back to talk to women moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated at something like one in thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close Russia's staff effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls that I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young\nAnd I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... yeah I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic um but at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the anonymous stem cell donated Holden hello Jeanette ... find mhm\nWith more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide in computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match\nFor me or the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that oh sure well I had leukemia ooh jeeze um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had looking if a sixteen years and I was in the hospital and I had numerous um transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a team of therapy because it's doing too much damage to your body you\nIt was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapse and that fight against that they gave me the parents find\nHuh [noise] now the person who gave me the transplant with an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to be contact\nMhm and I get back to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the heat the ...\nMembers of the U.S navy and when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the don't you send in Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is here\nAltruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab\n... that's it yeah ... ... to get the DNA so that's\nWhen his name entered the donor bang\nAnd then um years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells and they gave him these injection for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live\n... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have no serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see if the ... [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed to the last ... I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one so\nLet's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with\nA loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife um in in fact you know atheist agnostic have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that every one is like you and I I tend to believe you agree with you\nOK but uh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of decisions and voices and so on death\nThat vision is near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP until after the urge strongly common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing um for example someone phones you and you were thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about you right\nNow is that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a sense but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nAnd marry the Neal she loved to have an in back in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in Iraq just to go to the other nations so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that so I mean she she just the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFilled in their home no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show no that's terrible it was just ...\nHow did you get so interested in philosophy\nShe just always wires and there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my ... medical center in New York where they were studying deemed to like the the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to an e G ... um the AG could measure what we call them sleep rapid eye movement and then once the ... gene state\nThe send is that given event and images and they were told to concentrate on the images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to telepathy when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more susceptible to collapse of the when they're under hypnosis\nSo there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay

normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say is coming from something they've read or we could say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear\nYou know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to get into the dream state of other governmental leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the dream telepathy studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of\nGetting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how could we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um it wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I thought I I just saw these words that said\nThis is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the ides of march\nThat's right in fact she dreamt the night before he just tells you that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar the where the march which is the fifteenth of march and he he knows his his hair ignored its way and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong feminist premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole mini\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't leave their intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to that because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they just see guard things\nWhich could be dismissed that superstition is always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your permission\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think in theory I think people are they don't believe in\nThey don't believe in also they're afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up a book to tell the doctors nurses\nWhat they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctor pie and of course the doctor was founded there was another case for the blind patients who left his body during surgery I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and ended up serving everything that was going on and then when he when he be covered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures and he wanted his teeth back\nRight you have you back but then\nThen they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I fire you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some\nPeople call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical their mysterious Israel different words of being used to describe the same\nEvent so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do have quite it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there was something more out there that we don't just have to live heartbreaking nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many ... we're going to take phone calls your coals you your stories about pre cognitive dreams and so many of the things\nYou've heard us talk about here

enter panhandle orders governor Rick Scott heal the devastation caused by hurricane Michael so many families have lost everything\nAs a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Mandy\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone's hearing voices or certain qualities that would distinguish the psychic from a psychotic experience for example of someone hears the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery or insect\nThere may be more than one voice too with the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be infrequent\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and climbing the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at one symptoms such as hearing a voice you have to look at the whole person because psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside from the loose nation for example the thought disorder or paranoid id Asian\nOr you know feelings of reference\nThat people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nAnd you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\nYes in fact it has happened there is a psychologist that did it an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be patient but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... there were admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patients knew that they were faking so\nThey were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how do they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors could\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true [laughter] but the patients that\nThat's right because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls you for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting\nAnd waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I've let my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European\nFront ... well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit that not\nWho's ... and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be there\n[laughter] what'd you do then is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I was out of the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there's really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were fighting on the along with sewage canal\nYeah what was that the fifty seven more Nineteen sixty seven sixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat are you where do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping out the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up\nOkay between sleep in and awake but it's the most interesting experience I think I've ever had is what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed\nBecause I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you were in that particular place of knowing what all the companies seem love is\nAnd when I was during meditation or we think and and I could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles well this was\nAlive light and the whole screen of my vision was filled with this glittering beautiful different colors of orange and yellow and I could hear the voice saying this is love and I was\n... totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but\nI saw I'm listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when we're just\nI'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I the last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou were saying I'm back here yeah All right [laughter]\nBut ... you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of vision is because I had been up\nAll right that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to function or whether there's an illness that's interfering with their life\nSo it you can make a diagnosis or just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia because\nSomeone with a diagnosis gets feeding it has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions and you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations computer to actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell\nThere again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia and\nThey can also be hallucinations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy so you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise]\nBut I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of\nPain and dark\nAnd places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think there must be a reason why she's going\nWell for iPhone and now Android poured out

psychic abilities which they never had before\nNext up let's go to Gary in Monterey, California Hi Jerry go ahead\nI uh I like it is 'cause uh I'm a skeptical hurt them and uh I've got to agree to a couple of degrees and says it and I talked to physics engineering for years so I'm kind of a you know that kinda gosh you're however\nUh I had a dream that seem to come true uh many years ago and I was in my thirties and a ... and ... says a ... and that's disturbing you know our view of space and time\nAh right now it doesn't seem to allow information to flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year to a record my dreams and at first I tried a member of the seven days a portable tape recorders are kind of clunky\nMhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time the bright yeah so\nIt turns out that was a nightmare like uh getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button so I went back to just writing things down on paper and of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a drain I figured out a method for that that took me some that were reliable\nAnd one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual alive and then I decided but what happened later in the ... thing\nAnd I ... is a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him I'm comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her and uh at one point\nThe the nail says uh and we're outside I'm kind of a format outside I couldn't figure out the map\nBut anyway he says I'm a very I have to go to the bathroom you know where it is\nAnd I said no you know I Do too we were had been drinking a cup of the line I said I Do too\nAnd so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream we have to walk up a rock side but some kind of structure outside with all of a couple of steps and then there's another walkway going both ways more cables and then I Would have a couple of them just like many level and finally I said oh look I'm there to the bathroom got married\nAnd so I'm walking had a and and the dream\nAnd I get to the door and I pushed the bathroom door open\nAnd there and I'm trying to not be gross about this but there I see something unusual and what it was is in men's room have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing and you're in Bloomberg and then they have your old right someone\nHad in Iran all gotten number two\nIn other words [laughter] [noise] so\nI stopped in my tracks and and he ran it can be the cello in my dream and he said what are you doing and I said oh\nAh somebody to do something really awful and hair and he said well I mean he ... them\nAnd uh at that point\nI had a lot of foreign students I taught in college we recruited all over the middle east and uh and and the Pacific region into Asia Japan I had a lot of foreign students in my classes\nAnd so I said well you know maybe it's a person from another culture if we didn't understand and you know he thought that was the place to go to the bathroom and you know [noise] okay so I wake up\nAnd I thought that's a weird dream I'm going to write this down in some detail I ... I felt so\nOkay so that's like on a Monday\nI'm almost not a time here so I got to push a\nCouple of days later I get a call from an old friend of mine at college and by the we were roommates were good friends for four years\nAnd if you're going to be in San Francisco I'm In Monterey I'll be in San Francisco later this week do you want to make man or my wife and I should share okay so I made a mind San Francisco we go to ... where somehow which is an outdoor place is it outside and they serve lunch\nAnd exactly what's in the dream that I just describe happened\nOh my gosh no I don't know what's paranormal about that but that's just one weird dream to be sure many I Want to thank you for being on the ... good luck with the book where do you get the book Manny\nLet's available at Amazon and it's available at Barnes and noble handed to the bullet chapters and to go\nTo shows all over the place yeah it's all over the place\nWhere he thinks many appreciated the borders of normal is website is linked up\nThe coast to coast am dot com tomorrow we talk about finding a psychic attacks and then of course open lines right here on coast to coast for didn't belong the Tom\nDan Hi Lisa ... loon who is Sean modest shores Stephanie Smith cruise moral ...

fortune one hundred companies wallet meaning company in lectures widely across the globe his latest book that came out in November of two thousand Seventeen zero hour Harry what is going on with the stock market in my friend\nWell you know George we'd been warning you know for years but especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week and a whole ... just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction here which are pretty close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by sixteen trillion dollars are free money printed\nSince two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than early two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed or\nYou know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the times stocks go up and then they correct hundred twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years\nLike a clock and we're coming right on that clock in stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nYou buy back in when things at the bottom\n... you know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bonds and make money which he did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses it'd be preserved your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and you're short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna have another dog\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down ... percent and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip when what did the indicators marketed the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause is it just panic or ... what's happening\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only decades in advance on demographics the baby boom picking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nThe low interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble China is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that bottle of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my\nView is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop it they just build a tub backup with money that was draining this time more debt everything's\nMore stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty percent\nOff absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing

I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that the social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff and the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge and I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd it's hard to argue mid hatred on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy no that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nFamiliar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her it's ... it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero hour\nAnd and are newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom in global\nHis lawn you know Harry I've had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nYeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we were coming in two or three thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally comment and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to say and I\nDon't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or at best Trump holds on notice after we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing path\nNext to the end of next year but there is there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that from the forty\nPursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest ... was the only stock market it violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still\nViolated but the U.S

to your calls as well Harry ... within the can you predict out five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spending ... so yeah what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back and then we'll start to see\nA global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way in two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nWhere our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty per se there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more money there\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nIron ore and and and copper and things like that there will be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah but next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover\nFor and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the orange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we just for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be willing to be in the next year that\nThat it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now an even worse this time\nAnd then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this and the zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now\nThey also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise] so so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposits and worked in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext summer we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr ...

E. R. dot com\nI I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly started swiping money out of more fluent accounts [noise]\nThey're gonna have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but but this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of pride\nBut that and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to part we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices weight and keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing and the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely and the next couple of years\nTwo thousand eight here and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell well I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think\nThey should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on and uh you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send it you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty ... every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefitted corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to a check so he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or they got you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron download very good to have you\nKnow hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems worse farms\nWere over expanding and borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing and\nAnd also when you do with bank if governments have takes procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union than you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nRight towards our yeah okay thank you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my questions but before I ask that\nA director might have even when you write a part in my parents' flying a hiking up I'm like oh hey did you move away from all combat can line\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my gardening to limit they call it I'm here at talk of that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as um as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger accounts and more affluent people\nFirst I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected in whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit for into positives more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't\nPay they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were at a time here ...

listening this morning Americas first used with corn is deal now back to the program on five Ninety Days yes J. lo and I urge radio station\nMorning workout you are listening to America's first news this morning Gordon\nAnd if we can\nGet along with ... thanks for joining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura could just do the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places in New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes ... percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I covered with all the time and I know that right to to be a paper than ah it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the fix for than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that than\nUm with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense of it but it has been in the past that I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up in prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the higher rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner had the rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a moral has a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce their asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual or if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing\nAbove price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more expensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a\nNew York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price production\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think it means that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump within and rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on it are going to reflect that right away prices are still high um but I Do think for a virus that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war as and cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market\nThat has really cold and so I think for buyers who want a little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices down or the bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nFortunate the program

to nail hubs of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend Janelle how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts [noise]\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to save money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story ... absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or saying wow you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with ... of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum required hours for instruction\nSo you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they are when they were all five days if they were already seat in the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ...\nIt's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to four day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's non profits to have like relatively cheap day care and the and the school district might provide the meals\nA doodles nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some\nVery poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the district's iPad use for day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's all you know let's don't take kind of a mini vacation if they want to get away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um parents", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "12"}
