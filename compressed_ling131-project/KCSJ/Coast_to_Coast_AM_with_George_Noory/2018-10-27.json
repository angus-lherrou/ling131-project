{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "Trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there is an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial\nYou don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that the one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a\nPrice and he can't do that you're you're\nYou're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the\nThe some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nYou know on the surface of sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\nWe continue in the trajectory where now on\nIt it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ... you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just\nDoing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like\nYou they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small but\nYou know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him when they will have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and that I think the interesting these are that you is it that the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo ... or like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I\nTalk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process of creating our own\nConquers now how yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile and people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the

I Know several people who have a ... who have a\nTrouble walking or the lost their ability to walk in the ... mine all injuries and and that this to them as a dream ... do you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where\nAs you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms that them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I know it's amazing fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even and um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons\nI I think that's a I I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being\nFacetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we could come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah from the\n... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe\nSome of our advancements should not be consequence free\nIs that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about an ... sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I called that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know and and now and and the coalition\nA group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete\nAutonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are\nThinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that\nBasically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know yeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same\nYou know all our faults and our ... our weaknesses and are downsides\nJust get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending randomly and there were some terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nUh and his weaknesses but but positive for sitting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter]\nThat's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they they the the veins and the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they they've\nHave achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy and Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nOr everything that's connected all these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than a billion\nOf things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang on to that thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it Michael Guillen next and coast to coast am in

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ...\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk\nAnd it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it's like no they weren't so I mean I think\nSome of it as an education piece and and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this is really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book maybe totally irrelevant right because by that\nTime so that you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now into my\nQuestion before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about is how big the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will yeah but yeah I don't give it a little plug for an up [laughter] I think you you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and\nIt says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but\nGet so complex and soul yawn ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy ... running it's like running\nOn on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying\nOr for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting ... getting some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after the average you ever been in a situation where you\nKnow you're you're like try and everything stop you know the ... a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six\nSo I'm not clear that actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them\nSo keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nYou're going hey my question before I'm In ... and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and then or if they do we just lose him\nAnd we just lost [laughter]\nOh no All right Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but uh I've been on and kicking machine going on forty five\nYears yes er here and I was a banker degeneration\nI'd like you know from your guest or when we feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or a maybe a ... modified pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nHang hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael yeah\nWhat what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe's on dialysis is on ... ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nOr who had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help to actually restore sight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these time era\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells are ... create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm\nIn their brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nThat's

personality\nOf the uh I I'm with you in spirit I remember the incident that\nOh the Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep\nRight uh you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know uh other men if there are other people who have a ... problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul I'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology unsold\nUm but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I'm wild hog iceberg off or not in her five years I don't want to get through my interest right\nI'm after ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say I'm In march ... he bless her I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what it is a fireman\nNow and furthermore it our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and\nThere are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for that is families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple\nAnd um and we don't really we haven't really touch\nIt whether or not we are usable and we don't know even with training we don't know if the supplies what's known somebody in a cave\nOr in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt at all you like to um volunteer myself not him a consuming somebody's supplies but just to\n... myself and my child you then I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis than themselves\nAnd interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive that could be a child it could be a twelve\nYear old kid who hasn't had any training on how to year the supplies that are stored up and use codes are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just would be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's this series called like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I

[noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what's something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible 'cause I looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it's sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years I'm big because there's a lot of different books that address\nSo we'll do they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those were the only one I'm familiar with recovery right you're\nOn a good wanted a wrap it up quickly a lot of could go with you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with that kind of what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier whatever color you know something about ... a lot of life is\nIt your your creative freedom we have a we we all worship something you know whether it's money or her materialism or whether it's God him or herself um that we really appreciate that freedom is that you do you have to work your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that\nSure but I did it because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly\nOh yeah we have a responsibility to ourselves individually but can we got to collectively\nCouldn't agree more have some kind of shared values every\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is a I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about it the border that makes it as a country that's just not true you know it's at the border that makes me in Arizona and write or soon to be a cans and it's in a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to your philosophy should be where every education START I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the bladder but gosh darn it that was great thank you so much for jumping\nIn an open lines and look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer in history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nLet him make that decision I Want to think a George ...

love hearing the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects and some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Dylan was Clint joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras captured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment and coast to coast am\nDot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel on the top of the website and coast to coast am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote

thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me\nThere there's a lot to talk to a an about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nUh ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day as good as my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked it a bit later on or\nIf you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and\nYou are amongst I think in elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific come in you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very good at it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and this is just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it the sciences there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this when I was to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America hunting hunting Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then download it onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the world Wide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the Ford has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their accents and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to up load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nDo you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if

yesterday dot com [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of at all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow where to find the natural order of things\nAnd you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice and I was not nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive trade since depressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we\nDo that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do buy\nSlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as towns words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but he\nRecently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into\nThe thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\n\nWe continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God's because\nThey know everything they see everything they they can control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because\nThe the rate at which artificial intelligence is is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can be a chance to say you know Texas\nHold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you know ... you write\nIn artificial intelligence now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall\nIn I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we want spoke about being very good at that\nWell you know like you they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small but you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know like using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo ... or like the the cushy Murphy up yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose\nA yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process of creating our own\nConquer the yes raising with that the I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendship\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile and people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess I'm ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a call the trans human movement where as you say the the idea is to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable\nOr trends human augmentation there so there is usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial\nArms you know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you\nKnow these are these are arms that he can move with his thought so they're they're wired to his mind\nAnd I like them isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there\nYeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack you know if if if they if we can give them an extra fellow Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons\nI I think that's a I I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm\nHere's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah from the\n... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe\nSome of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I called that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know and and now and and the coalition\nA group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are\nThinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that's basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now and another escalating arms race right\nYou know ... in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know\nYeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we had our just still the same you know all our fault in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to a gorilla her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going [noise]\nUh and his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new head an old hand on the new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments\nRight there were like All right now there's this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\nYeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you

Michael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we get because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I could pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story and the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm\nTest tube babies and that was I remember that yeah yeah they they won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful 'cause it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant\nRight because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is the end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] you know I think you\nYou were talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine\nIt says is that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this theory that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation I I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot\nBut get so complex and so the non\n... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou you know it's like the sky net running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting on well you get some coffee yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Ken more elite dishwasher six so ... that ... those exactly where I'm living and by the way\nTo as somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death\nThat center so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for me I'm In trouble and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\n\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question\nYeah they do we just leave them and we just left a\nA now alright Well James is in a in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but uh I've been kicking machine going on forty five\nYears yes or a bank and argue generation\nAnd like you know from your guest or when we feel that\nThe shoe will\nBe overcome to Christ or or a maybe a churning out if I pay I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machinery\nAnd he's on dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using\nStem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joints spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this is the

got a number of years on it you're the good climate down there that helps but uh I Would check the wiring going to they're also as an opportunity and that's why you're looking at your ideas there\nRight now let me ask you this or how would I go about checking the wire from the um the airbag module to to the part of the driver's side [noise] shoulder harness too I Would it be okay if I unplug the connector at the macho\nAnd then go to the end of the connector and do a continuity check\nRight you need to disconnect the battery from the car weighed about Fifteen minutes and then disconnect that airbag mazel and disconnect the pre tension or itself and then test\nThe module and the pretentious or what you got to be very careful though\nBecause you want to make sure there's a lot of wires on that and you will to all the sensors and all the airbags you want to make sure you're testing the right one because if you and own meter makes its test by sending a small electrical current out one lead and looking forward to come back and the other and looks at the time and things like that resistance to travel\nIf you connect to know meter to an airbag let's say you are proven that it was supposed to be this PIN this pin 'cause a lot of lawyers are very similar colors\nAnd they're small if you were to accidentally connect to a different pretension or\nInstead of the one that you have open there's a possibility you could potentially deploy who could set it off yeah that's that's so you want to make absolutely sure you're on the right one\nAnd that can be done a couple of different ways if the wires are different colors and you have a wiring diagram off the Internet that says let's say ... Nineteen and twenty were the ones\nI don't know what they are in this one but if those were the two and a wire is yellow and green and they match up for those pins then you go to the other end of the connector and you see the same pins are the same caloric advice you with us\nYeah and this might be the worst advice given today so it's good advice from you today\nBut I Would first just take that thing apart over by the pretension her physically look at a inspect do I see anything you might have some little jump right out at you and if you don't see anything in the wiring looks good before you start doing a bunch just you might be it'll go to a social service yard in your area and for less than thirty bucks get another seat belt and pretension or\nOut of another car that has not been in an accident just swept part out I mean I don't often ... promote parts swapping but you sound like a do it yourself or that could be up for a ...\nLike that it'd be pretty in yeah Bruce thanks very good

the hood show what can we do for you\nYeah well I call last week I got the Nineteen Ninety crown Victoria and that was the one where I called my heater slider controls\nWere work yes okay\nWell I got a used one out of a link this control and I figured out what's wrong with this little shaped short\nMetal that were originally encased in plastic and the plastic as hard and and cracked off of there and that's why this wiggle around but that's what I was going to ask you for taking my part but I took apart this used one you know\nAnd is there any companies you suppose rebuilding that wouldn't mind have this little teeny shaped metal piece that's the way it goes\nIf it was a Seventy nine ... maybe on a Ninety nine convict most likely not now what I Would more likely do is look for you got creative mind you've called the show before you know what could I Do to replicate that\nAlready got on that I got a sheet cruelly I'll probably use a router and then you got to plan already I bet\nIt slides into slot and that's what this plastic that broke off that hard and then it can it doesn't slide evenly rock sideways and stuff\nYeah is there is there a plastics company or somebody you could take the part about Santa too I'm sure there is but the Avi well actually that's a good idea that\nI've had some ... kind of yeah I've had some things that were like that so I could I could\nPut the J be wild around it and it doesn't even have to look perfect when you first do it once it completely hardens then you can file it you can stand it you can really you can file it and you can make things out of it and what's the worst is going to happen if you don't do it right clean it off and do it again\nYou know using pliers and break it up and do it again but that might be an idea I've used that to make ... for things that I couldn't\nGet I mean I'm not gonna use them for like a like an ... or something like that but I'm for dashed controls and things were just they've worn out you know my novel my stereo wore out at home\nIt was ... you know these the center broke out word fit over the dial pretty common you know I just busted that off but a big garbage ab weld on it and then once it harden I drilled a hole in it\nAnd use my little filed a five one flats button they crammed it back on the stereo not worried as knew I was going to throw it away of like I don't want to throw that thing away I've had it forever then he'll be out there grant\nWell yeah I got the sheet of acrylic sitting right here and then maybe we'll next to it All right\nWell thanks for calling grant now we've

you've you've been visiting the under the show that is the point of all of it because they also control what you see sometimes in ... they might want to use some something that's been paid for first re also just go to our page check it out and if you go to Russia or dot com use the code ... save ten percent of every eight six six\nFive nine for for one five oh let's talk to Iran and North Dakota ray you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nWhen my son is in a part of the call what I Would like to have access to his website where you can check the F goes out before you purchase the frozen car is there such a size\nWell there's actually quite a few of them are you know one of the more trusted ones over the years was Consumer Reports they have got you know they they I\nGet suspicious anymore and everything but they claim to be fairly independent ... and you always got to look to see who's funding what and and what angle they might lean but they have proven over the years to be quite independent on their tests and they've also archived a lot of their tests that they've done over the years\nThat you can go back to uh they test about everything car and driver motor trend wrote and track\nThey are they like to test for the specialty vehicles first but at some point they do get into tests of of common cars I and I say come just a more normal stuff\nAnd those you have to be a little aware of because they might score something higher or lower based on something that they think it's important that has no but ...\nExactly and they will do long term tests where they put the cars into their fleet and they drive him a Consumer Reports says a similar thing there are but as far as a Web site are you thinking where you'd look and see okay this cars at this many problems reported um that sort of a thing I guess we'll make sure what you're looking for\nYeah that is correct\nSo it'd be kind of a forum were oh boy that that I got to think about that for a second I think a lot of uh you know\nThere's Consumer Reports and they used to have a\nA I Believe they had a Consumer Reports reported by actual drivers type thing\nThey did that with a fuel economy sites ... go for a while it said here's what the government sticker or you know manufacturers Tucker set on the window and here's what drivers actually reported and they get you know twenty people that said well I got sixteen miles per gallon average\nI'm Out of all of them and the manufacturers that have got an Eighteen or got fourteen so sometimes it's better sometimes is when you\nWhen you talk about the well this is always a a slippery slope because if you put in\nUm any company any type of car ending and you say rant and rave about this or whatever might have to be or I mean there's a website dedicated people crabbing about stuff right and guess what people do they're they come and crab about stuff that to me it's not an indication of what really happens with that\nThing or that car or that company or you got to be able to dissect that data and look for some common themes are because I'll tell you that people\nThat have vehicles can have a bad experience with any vehicle based on their use or their care right and it really can so I mean it would be hard to make the results be consistent because none of the problems are happening under the same\nThe same circumstances if you know if you have a certain type of engine it may fail quicker under poor maintenance than if you did good maintenance where it would last much longer\nAnd people rarely go out and how how well something works occasionally you'll see something on a on a former website\nBut it's it's rare and this kind of is very dangerous but I got to say it that based on the\nType of car and the demographic of the consumer that it would end up in the type of comic could be different\nI totally agree yeah the experience factor um you know certain demographics might have more experience with automobiles than others and they could give you a completely different reports than a first time ... depends on the you know a but there's just\nThere's gotta be careful absolutely to answer your question ... there are thousands of them and that's\nThe tough part [laughter] thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five ... let's talk to T. J. T. J. you're on the under the hood show what can we do for ya\nHello I'm I bought a all seven for focus a little over a year ago had a hundred and eight thousand when I bought it up to a hundred and forty two cells and now on um\nI've had to replace the tires three times a on the vehicle as gifts wearing your tires like crazy I've had the alignment checked three times\nUm one time they are so there was out of whack in and replace some stuff but uh\nIt was your time's going fine I just can't get a sort of tires to last for\nMore than ten thousand miles before they're gone\nAnd just to be clear you go down you don't make drifting videos right using the U H M mode for the ultimate\nHer name on the [laughter] yeah no okay a normal daily driving I'm a retired like ... and ...\nHow many miles from this car now total ... and he's he's got it to one forty two so he's done a you know thirty thousand miles camera take and so he has three sets of tires on already in ...

welcome back to the end of the show we're glad to have you with us eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's stop declaring Clarence you're on the under the hood shown what can we do for yeah\nSee I got a two thousand Ford Expedition five four leader and I've had it for five years and every year when it gets down to about thirty five forty degrees at a idols really rough and then like I say when it gets above forty degrees in idled rate\nAnd does it stay that way all all the time under thirty five\nUh yep and cut up all winter long it'll do that um you know when I when I drive at um\nGet home park and if I just let it idle in the driveway there it'll be fine for a couple of minutes and then that just that falls right back into\nIt was it cools off it'll do it but once you get run down the road of warms up a little bit and it stops\nRight yeah that sounds to me like you might have a vacuum only going on that's causing it to run rough as it cools down things contract you get it into a gasket doing that causes to run rough when leaks doesn't check engine light ever come on\nA checking your lights that on since I bought it but it you know it pops on and off once in a while\nWell that would be another thing that would lead to the exact thing too as it runs lean it throws a code because the engines trying to max out those fields rooms and when they get up to the top they say you can't give it any more fuel to make this thing run smoothly\nLet's turn the light on the engine warms up the light turns\nOff I've also had those exact problem in the last week\nWith someone who tried\nTo run they said I'm going to try you Fifteen ethanol in my vehicle because you guys have said that it's new on the news it's OK to run it and they said but I'm Upset with you because I put it in and my check engine light came on I put the regular back the ten and it went off and I told them\nIf that's the case it's not the fuel\nYour car is already running borderline on being you've leader at the edge of the parameter already which is going to affect your fuel mileage no matter what you put in so just like yours words\nIt's close so I said bringing it just want to look at it I'm just going to know charge I'm just going to scan it I Want to see what I see and I look at it and sure enough the fuel terms or at Seventeen and they've got regular know ethanol and I'm like\nYou're close I open the hood it's got a vacuum line on the side of the intake that cracked on the edge not bad but just a tiny little bit\nRight I sniffed off the end with a pair of scissors and slipped back on the field terms went to one says like you know go put what you want it it's that\nJust kind of indications so yours it's running bad now but I Would bet at at some point it's probably going to run bad all the time or the temperatures are going to change so now it it does it at fifty or sixty you know and then all the time\nAnd it could be into the gas is my first step and diagnosing years would be to plug it into a scan tool and I read the fuel terms when the engines warm\nAnd then I'd let it sit there and as it cools off watch them and if they keep climbing up as it gets cooler and then finally it starts running rough and their way off that's going to explain their who's gonna feel tremendously well\nThe field for him just ... the the engine computer says were designed with this much fuel going in and this much air going in to runs move in with gasoline that's fourteen point seven to one they called us which you'll metric ratio is the big\nFan ice and we're just means ... pretty sure that at that rate I'll get right even the fuel will burn\nIt's cleanest with his most power and most completely you too much fuel its rich gets too much fuel and it's it's all the tailpipe to lean and that's also bad you get excessive heat and that can damage things so you want that perfect ratio while the engine computer at the perfect ratio\nMeasured by the oxygen sensors will say zero you\nKnow we're we might we're ... we're both in between ... originally originally originally ... were right there were zero well if you start applying\nUm you start doing things like adding ethanol to fuel you go five ten Fifteen twenty thirty percent even going up while the ... the computer can adjust for that it's completely electronic so it says less at more fuel were still perfectly safe no check ins and like\nIf you have a vacuum leak that's a very small as it gets bigger it'll keep adding fuel until it can't any longer when it\nCould in ... the thing you can add via the computer or take away yeah and it's like a leaf\nYou inject you're well if it can't do that anymore it turns the light on gives you a warning but there are situations like this truck that\nAt times it can control that fuel and keep it in that range and keep the light off but when it gets cooler if it does develop a leak and that's just one of the things that could do it it could be as simple as a dirty masterful censor too but when that changes that's when the light comes up\nAnd if you had a vehicle doing this that it did not have a light on and it seemed like everything was\nFine it can either be that you've got a carbon build up in the veil of area and that carbon when it gets cool can really mess up their fuel spray in the field trim into the vehicle uh so you've got a you've got things that can come with age too that will affect this and I think we're Russ the point you make for our listeners though\nWe want to blame things on something but sometimes the the result is just a ... an erosion overtime now so I said if you if both super cheap\nClarence thanks very much for the call that'll do it for another hour of the end of the show until next time you can find a

mechanical ability his to recognize things that may leave of vehicles stranded I have seen cars that were in way better shape with two hundred and Ninety thousand miles on them I'm running well they look pretty good then cars with the hundred and fifty on them of you know ...\nYou don't know I mean we just had a guy put an engine and in a suburban with\nA well over two hundred thousand miles but it was still is usable and then the body was\nGetting pretty beat up it had a couple of collisions here and they're on it but it wasn't rusted at all a very solid sometimes they don't want to give that up if you have a car that has a little bit of damage that well he's very load and every day and a couple of hundred miles a day\nWhen we have Dr ... are one of our divisions is buying end of life vehicles and we buy 'em from the public and we buy 'em from total yards and different places just stuff that's people think or are done and we see people that folks that call us\nAnd set us pictures that say this car is done it just it's it's more out and we look at it like\nReally that's wore out they all have different opinions and then you'll have people bring went out and say oh this things at the end of his life and you get there like oh my gosh you've like more down to the nothing there's nothing left to discard it it just wore out one into the other\nAnd they've used every ounce of energy they can get out of that car so it is a matter of perspective when the end is on a car like that now the things that we tell her who does all the time that I think it's important to keep in perspective is exactly what ... what's that\nSo what is the condition of the structure of the car is the body clean and not rush to to the point where it's structurally not safe\nUh please understand the difference between the surface rest on the paint and structural rust\nUs there's a huge difference a cosmetic Ross is going to happen just like you get a wrinkle on your forehead as you get older you are with your hand through the door but if you have a structure where\nSuspension components both on where the ... towers red underneath the hood where the rear suspension arms both up or the cradle is underneath the car if you've got structural rushed in those areas of the vehicles getting older especially for our listeners in the northern climates and the rust belt that are going to put that car over the edge quickly\nNow if the body down south or in the heated areas of the southwest so we got listeners over the place and that thing is solid as Iraq there are people\nTaking vehicles to four hundred thousand miles five hundred thousand miles interiors where out of them quicker than anything from the sun and so it's really it's really a matter of perspective but the the the in my opinion\nThe hundred and fifty thousand miles car today is Twenty years ago was eighty thousand miles vehicle if just to give some perspective or what does that sound about right right and we're in there\nWell well you know and that's I live and and the part of the country where um where it snows in and we don't really go out in the snow unless you have a four wheel drive and we don't for chemical and the roads so structurally it's pretty sound you know and I I haven't done a whole lot of the vehicles since I've\nWater but you know I still got to fight the dashboard where my daughter fit it off what she was mad at me and things like that so I'm just kinda curious as to you know how long can I hold on to this\nAnd that and I wonder but also by chance\nThe five year old daughter and your child is not the five point three motor you're too they'll do Silverado will take you\n... well Russ what's in your town do you guys are at two hundred and forty five so yeah and I've seen him regularly at three Seventy three fifty a regularly or with sure with no major work done to them other than just maintenance things when a cooling pipe would break or a water pump goes out to her\nUm you know if the if you get a build up in it from just time of not getting the oil changed correctly that it's All right Larry relatives the transmission is if they haven't pulled a ton\nI think they usually they they can make it to two fifty\nA but if they get where I think I\nDid have an accident where I Do have a new transmission about forty thousand miles ago I er and I was I'm pulling anything I was just a overlooking and approach you know and it just didn't go into reverse for me so that was pretty exciting going down that ills that\nYou know but I Do have a relatively new transmission so everything else is pretty south\nYeah let me look at those trucks the just to get very specific about that vehicle the temple or in GM's made them for years they last well unless you overworked them then they will wear out when they are overloaded and overworked or the front differential do will the front differential ... I wouldn't know typically last\nAs long as you don't have a ... bad and your slowly leaking fluid out and then you run the grease out of them running away a lot of them are\nThe transfer cases it's kinda the same way I mean if you're just not but when you start working those things that they will break down one fifty to two fifty somewhere in there\nI don't know it's not an easy question to answer but um if you've got a non rusty trucking it's working good and you consider that when you drive through the lot and I just have to do this the other day they have to do two thousand Nineteen Sierra trucks sitting out in a lot and I thought I drive by and see what the prices on these things well do you want a six point two leader\nLoaded up half ton Denali fear the you know the just I went for the highest price when they had and that one of the highest price went in that particular name was sixty eight thousand dollars for a half ton pickup and the more\nThe more basic one was sitting at about fifty three so you can can you know put that in your ... year old to this costs in yeah not a lot right and right it's got to be a pretty strong decision\n[laughter] Aaron thanks very much for the call and good luck so if you if I were just asking you I'm going to go look at trucks what mileage would you like to at what point is really start to get married to twenty five to fifty I Am going to give you a different answer you don't even I'm leery at one fifty\nBut I Want to know the history of the ...
