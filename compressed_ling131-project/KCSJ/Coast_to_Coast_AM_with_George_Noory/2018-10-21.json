he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and in September twenty twelve you spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham

afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nPleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini he's um how should we just practice I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker\nAnd I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing\nSo um that kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics we're\nTalking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and there would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time this this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know he had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the\nMagician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to the sky or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer we take a picture and\nAnd the you know the fake media would be totally surprising if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah just writing on beating on Harry right into my\nThat's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so\nI had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would ... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but\nA lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and\nI think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did\nBreak off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] but do you call it the automatic writing kind of reading\nThis is important to ask who this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that forward with a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or a boat Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contracted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\n[noise] well I Hope it or not and just admit it but I just wanted to point out\nI think that this worked because bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how will we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and\nHarry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his mind putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to ...\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit was surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't taught us I gotta jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nKnow\n\nMom\n\n\nMirror networks resumes goes to goes to the you know use your guest to Richard Sayre is\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.

discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my oh James Pike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven forty how let's say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on what he did with all the secret to do the trick is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research brings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers\nAnd found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't\nBelieve that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public San says on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but\nWhen Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one\nTo do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do it on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know and yours is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere\nAnd this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a

[laughter] it's not worth the mantle makes mistakes you were asked to go so far\nRight now in the case of FDR um you know this is this is Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of the century I mean was it or was it difficult at this stage in the game to to reopen this very very cold case\nAt all they're always difficult because I never want to know that there's a germ students read all of us like truth\nJustice and you're not in a way and you don't want to think of anything sinister is going on a you know behind your back and so so they're all\nThey're all they're all I just I just mean finding the documents I'm Sorry say again\nI I just mean finding the documents or uncovering the the the real facts of the case after all this time\nWell what I did as a I went to the laws about mansion and upstate when Hyde Park New York which was a terrific place we ever get a chance to go and spend an hour or two it was\nA beautiful place in the Roosevelt mansions on to the phones over overhead is the national archives show I just want a tremendous amount of time with ... or ... when we can use it with top secret previously\nAnd they're huge files there on the hour and a his wife Eleanor ... there's that's very corrupt filing cabinet right in the middle or the animals crawl over actually\nThat and I want to Roosevelt and actually the communism she was being investigated being investigated for being a common so you know it's it's who you will never had that information years ago\nYou know so that's where the majority are we going promotional came from is from the original documents and I'm turned out to be a better place for the country as far as robbing people the wrong way\nEverybody rubs some of the wrong way for doing something you know I don't really even I mean listen all\nRight well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes stings um but you it's needless to say\nYou don't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalinist Russia and the er the programs in the ... the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nA paint me a a a a portrait of the young FDR\n... you know I was\nA I ... I Would say he was beneficiary of the ... this guy was born in any way\nWho [laughter] you know I mean there's ... they were just sitting in the news was old world well I mean there are groundwork quarter mile down the road is the Vanderbilt man\nYou know they're on the some basic parcel of land I mean to say that this guy was wealthy in and had every single thing you're the desired was an understatement um you know big\nNow that would be anyone people at nothing so\nI'm ... ah you know it was\nAll the while he was out around\nBut not establish student um sees all the way through school or he'd grab the roof off and go play football and so forth and uh it was a well I think it was all worth it I Want to use but he was a new something was really a ...\nIs really something I think anyone was there for the asking and his political where it started out in the Los about maintenance and help them to physicians and they blossom them being governor of new or by the people don't know what I was governor of New York after they forgot but they're just not talking about it anymore\nOr law you know he he was an old man now he just talked to him [laughter]\nOver Roosevelt was born a Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt biter Roosevelt which was a little odd\nOr the woman got ready to change the monitor ... part of life actually [laughter] no um no I mean\nThis is the evolution of the good person\nAt least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was he a second or third cousin\nThinking it was a second ago\nRight and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about that\nBecause that was just not the way that he was raised by that Roosevelt name off that was done anything to find out if he was\nA quote in early a boat all you know the special in that comes out so\nYou can get a lot of things are without unsavory than some self marrying\nHis cousin on funding a\nNumber Teddy Roosevelt you know that in public it was awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York classic now he would you know he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um ... sort of I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy socks and Kmart back in the er the member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nShort [laughter] yeah\nAbsolutely halo suffering as he gets a free pass off of\nThe thing is to guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's all history repeating repeating itself\nWith the Russians and the White House and you know just all\nKinds of things it's incredible uh what's happening it down and long known catches it you know\nThey felt they help but how is it that uh\nThat no one sort of you know to a store or said hey wait a minute our president is gonna is in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is the thinking back then obviously we know better now but\nThe idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago um ... no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their cameras shops well\nAnd actually I Would hope people for five of the day that this was a guy who did\nHe was he can really think on four or five thought processes are what do you really really really tough so what do you do is ... with ... someone ... you will lose their arm and help but look at your pain or something if he ... he would appear to be walking\nPicket a couple of steps so they get I guess you know buying podium use a little bit different than the shops and you know they they really remarkably well so they they are to ward off the fact that a case anything do you\nEat painting insurance shopping to go public and claimed that you know five minutes ... so low ... and for X amount of hours\nSo I mean the propaganda and all those oils Walsh anything jak down you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control that we didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they could get wiser they did it work\nFor him when he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\n[laughter] yeah absolutely that\nI'm like this is complicated I um don't describe the toy the lemon had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January\nSo you didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that Roosevelt had to wait to take off for or expert so\nThis mystery thing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents by ... hundred days\nI'm at the table in hundreds it was because of the changes\nRight he had a four to four months to a head start listening will not take a

already broken the Japanese POWs I had a conversation about this with Oliver Stone twenty Thirteen he came out with a series the other side of history I Believe\nA DVD sir yes yes he came to the exact same thing in this book was was in the middle of writing this back then are researching it always because I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate\nThe same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just\nA matter of one that had happened\nAnd so again or or did he let it happen did eat while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much more knowledge do you think he had\nThe actual attack\nDifficult to fell I Know they had at least a week's notice and you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor so they were not at Pearl Harbor on the attack happened which is a little sister suspicious\nYou know aircraft carriers time to be a pretty\n... pretty necessary commodity in a world like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where a you'd be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting so\nWas pretty good evidence to support the ah\nYou know the same to support that conclusion let's say they definitely had a as a matter of fact the History Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel they even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find in the ... the thing just the that very thing because we're broken and I thought well\nHey look at that you know I mean I I I knew I got it right but I didn't know how

Mussolini at first he was in awe of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that tendency over the last um [noise] so America gets into the war and Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed and night for more\nThan a month every night um people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there how close\nEngland cans are losing their island they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go and lay down air strikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially with France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course that who had met previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who gather\nTogether but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar to the time\nThat style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to be home and saw one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we\nWeren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\n\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a\nPieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communism endorsement\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ... million\nFDR it seemed to a ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face was down and I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned in need us we need it style and style and and the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs and so he was such\nA delusional dictator if at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winner is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want to do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has the other hand here\nThere's the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robots or you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to tackle the minute and talk about the assassination squads hitting that we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nIntrigued me in the country and to this wonderful new ideology you didn't know anything about evil employers you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and sprinkling by stone stone is the puppet master the uh he's\nThis guy would he managed to accomplish with his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the most of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of stone\nHe was nothing more than a used to keep the party journals are used to call them um read 'em when they come on red index\nCard he was the going rate we're used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party one by one knocked off every one of the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was standing stop I'm I'm Sorry\nI'm Lenin wrote that it is a quote from one of those will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous remove

I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point and obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts of the time in a you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff and you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there was this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nThank Richard thank you for taking my call my state\nI Do know that had been ... originally made their money to the site trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller ah\nStarted out lighting houses with kerosene that for that combat stumble engine that guy's a gasoline like a byproduct than that cannot days ran they got down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and and they\nHave a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually in the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know where the top is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the SEC the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's all money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all the money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well yeah I had heard\nThat about the Delano family as well there is so much information out\nThere I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny

Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the side saying for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person and on the radio and in September twenty twelve you spoke for the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team\nIs the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we just practice I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nFor these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books\nYou mentioned and he really um he um was not just on this side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her\nThrough some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in the abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and\nThey would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps\nSome of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task\nOf of uh yeah this\nRumbling on beating on Harry right into my\nThat's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so\nI had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight anyway I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yeah it's\nA ... was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an a vow to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossed\nAnd pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nBut eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between

P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nUm the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the sounds as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's\nIt puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public ... on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be\nA failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know and yours is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut your inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened yes\nYes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was trick she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and they will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to be a little lost um\n[noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nI'm anyway or we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there how close\nEngland came to losing your island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially\nWith France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time\nThat Stalin in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we went in with your friends\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we weren't\nGetting things from Russia we didn't know much about that rate for I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in the New York times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed a ... and reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we needed style and Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and Stalin had to pack well ill or violated the pack and\nWent after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know it was ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leaving under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course\nWe didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so\nStyling is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little\nA little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference of Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a was\nIn Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct they have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's a pretty robust or you know he you know by by the standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty\nYears old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nFind anywhere else all at a fraction of the price\nAnd with free shipping visit gasoline dot com today she buys is all about I'm going back on gasoline

my name is art I have a honey motor all at a cut cut away Schatz twenty or sold it to me with one thousand miles on it it was a\nAnd the Raj a problem with the end and it ended up being a far south as Ninety four and as a lake a two or three to four hundred miles an annual trip to the ... down back\nWow the owner or last donor I Want to know if I can I ask you on that and about ... terrible at it as this area a ... a A N e answer if a particular a\nProblem I strive for\nYour time I enjoy your show\nA chord of oil every hundred and fifty to two hundred miles seems like\nA lot ... on the ground you know that's a that's a lot leak and now that may be a head gasket or something else you're gonna have to find out where the leak is from first and see if you want to go on with any further repairs because if it was a head gasket Lincoln and it was running out are valves covers yeah than those\nOther unusual on a big the like that yeah it that you normally when you get that kind of oil consumption on a V. eight 'cause I'm assuming this to be a Fort Dodge GM chassis which is going to be there are three fifty or a or a three fifty one or or or you know or sixty four and there's just different things like that it could be an ... they're going to be\nEating that it will not leaking it most likely but as far as the valve develops go if if it was if the liquid something separate and you could identify how to fix the leak\nThose older the eight engine it is not always a bad idea to to remove the heads and fix the fix the valves at a machine shop and put that motor back to health again with is low mileage as you have on the bottom in yet\nStuck to Jim Jim you're on the end of the ... what can we do for ya\nRecently read an article about a company in England that has developed a new engine that gets rid of the time and changing timing belt felt springs in the valves are controlled by computer controlled electric motors\nAnd by doing it that way this company has been able to do die in a mom and her\nTesting what this engine and the emissions are reduced by about twenty percent and they explained that the way they get the computer to\nTime the opening and closing of the valves is safe place a sensor up some time on the crane shaft and from reading that article it just really interesting it seems like just when you think\nA gas engine really cannot be improved the very much\nSomebody comes up with this new system to control the opening and closing all the valves and it just looked super cool I just hope that they can continue to develop this engine and get it into a vehicle some day because it just a a huge advancement in terms of using computers to make engines more efficient\nThey've already got some similar to that in America in er in in our cars now they've taken the throttle body off the car completely\nAnd what they've done is they use the\nThey're using oil pressure to power the valve and then electronic solemn wide open and close it and they open the valve they open it more or less to control the Airflow so they open up more than its like opening the throttle bodies open that less to cut it down those those are still using timing change\nThe one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that but these these cars that you're talking about they don't even have a throttle body on them anymore they just have a whole like a diesel does and the intake with an air filter or a turbo chargers\nBut there's no there's no blade in there to control the the Airflow at all anymore which moves out the Airflow changed everything just changes on 'em and it's like a a better mouse trap you never thought they could come up with a better one\nThen they came up with a piece of sticky tape but uh [laughter] you know these engines it is true they are coming up and we think that's as far as they can go advanced I'll bet there'll be something\nThe manufacturers are there are screaming and screaming would be a bit of exaggeration but they really want us to get higher octane fuels across the whole fleet and if they can do that there's there is guys limit type of things they can do\nEight

flat out turn away and say you less this thing does it when you bring it in so we can get it and drive and check it\nWe're just not going to do it right now you're going to have to put up with it until it gets worse\nAnd in some cases they've already been to other shops and said well I spent a hundred to two hundred bucks and another shop and they looked at it and they didn't find anything and and I got charged and it didn't get fixed so I feel a little better when I say I'd rather not touch it then and do it do you uh service than just walk\nAn absence of any lights or any sort of an indication that you could find out that makes it very very difficult though Ross with your best advice I Know mine would be if you know that on a warm day on a heavy drive\nIt will do it and it's not ... that might be the time to call and say hey today I Know I'm going to be driving out around the town is a good chance to happen if I stopped in this afternoon it's doing it can we\nLooked at ... and we were right 'cause that's that's the time we're going to do it and I might tell a customer you know if you can do it and driving while it's doing it we got will have a minimum charge of X dollars we will drive and hook it up while it's occurring if it's not going to be occurring we're just not going to do it\nThe Volkswagen Beetle people's car which they've stopped making or they're stopping making what\nWhat was the last I Believe that was a announced Seventeen or Eighteen and I read this while I was gone no no this is all new here is this is so old that it's not even\nTesla has proven how difficult it can be be to produce a car from scratch without infrastructure in place or decades of assembly line experience GM and Honda have both\nThey do so that's a ... and that's what everybody keeps saying is that\nTesla is is pushing the marketing an amazing way and there there was an article I I I caught the headline on when they got to be careful of headline teases now in days but the fact was that BMW is recognizing the pressure that you know is being put on their midsize sedan by the by the model three I'm ... and it it's it's real\nBut uh the the challenge for an upstart make or just like you said is that they can be innovative they can be pushing the boundaries\nBut they don't have that head start on actually having the facility to get built and if the other manufacturers decide you know it's our turn to jump in all of a sudden the game just changed and they have to be so established to withstand that\nAnd now everybody in the water and what I've learned about I Love swimming in a pool by myself but everybody else gets it gets larger swim ... whatever might be watching and seeing what was going on while I was there to test the store and talking to some people that were a little more knowledgeable than me which was everybody there at the store\nThey're gearing up and they know that they're behind in production and they know they're a start up which when you look at Tesla or any car company that's I mean look there there quite a ways they ought to start now they were right but they were they were a nobody I think it was they said it was\nTwo or three college kids that were coming out that it wasn't even must that came up with ... it was these college guys and then it was taken taken over\nSo as an electric car but they started with nothing and the brutal where they are and there could imagine a sky is if we decided we wanted to start up a bicycle company and compete which when [noise] no it's not going to happen so you start ... they've really made a mark\nBut one thing they did say they said no look\nOur plants are smaller and we're trying to do this right to get it the way we want but once we get there\nThey said their technology they have to build the cars once they get it to capacity is far beyond what the manufacturers have their like\nGuys come on we can send a rocket to space and landed on a platform that's moving and the notion as they told me we can have an entire plant that assembles cars with less than a third of the moving parts so they go together quicker\nHundred percent with robots can work twenty four hours round the clock and quickly they said if we ever hit that mark\nWe can do it and I think the other manufacturers are going to follow suit hopefully that'll bring her car coastal\nIf there are any a start up billionaires out there who want to buy a radio show yeah I mean not just put ... I mean if you would like to advertise on it but if you just want it and want us off [laughter] go shading plate right All right let's take a quick break you're listening to the end of the show\nWe recently sat down with Greg zip Adelie competition director for Stewart Haass racing\nAs of today they've won five of the first eleven races for the twenty teens season Greg talked about the importance of the relationship with with filters\nYeah here it's too hot we're fortunate to have a number of\nTechnical partners I mean obviously to perform at a level that that we need to do and what I mean by that is if we can align ourselves with um companies that can help us have an edge in performance then we're better than our competitors and for many years which has helped us design or\nAll kinds of filters are specially the air filters and do a phenomenal job allowing us to package the maximum\nAir filter size and our air boxes were always you know looking for that little bit extra edge um so we're always looking at you know different police in different coughing and things from that nature and and and they're always there to help us an answer or all of our needs\nLearn more wicks

to be that\nClose luck scratch like a dog and the rest of the show but uh\nThere's conflicting reports I'm On this whether or not they're going to stop the Beatles here in the United states or their\nTheir sales were down about three point two percent last year with but uh in Europe than they are going to be putting more concentration on their electrification efforts okay and they all lived through digital it may not be well they've got to do id bugs that they're coming out with the\nYou ever had a sandwich from that place in the electorate a great oh and they're they're great band to the uh but anyway there ain't guys [laughter] All right go ahead so they're going to be a\nPut more effort into the id bugs in Europe and it may come to a device here in the United states by the ... yeah what is that it's kind of a universal platform car they're trying to make like OK okay I've got you know they used to be able to take your cars what was that thing you get when you're I saw that you could get one chassis and switch a bunch of\nBody or the store or the old oh I had a name and one of our ... is going to tell us just like we said what was the you know the Mississippi's we're talking about the yeah the ... it's like it's all on the verge of Washington Seattle fixture oh what's that like the late eighties right\nYeah and it was like a it was like a component you could dress it up to different things but yes there used to be a ... a store in the mall of America you can do the same thing yeah not the famous you're talking about\nYou know this was the thing that we lost so who do I ... the yes on the I spoke to make sure it's the one from the eighties you could change we got to figure out what that\nWas ... eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's go to Texas and talked to Hernandez Hernandez you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\n[noise]\nFantastic [noise] yes\nI have a question I have a thousandth of a dodge got the bottom line and come in\nAnd out and about a three hour trip about halfway ah I'm On this trip up to get something to drink and a condition that working perfectly there's nothing wrong with it\nGet back in ... and ah [noise] not long cold anymore okay today later I just saw when I got there and I and then I come back I didn't have air conditioner so up to my true when I got a mother or a letter to the today and the batteries are completely dead\nNow I've noticed a lot of pressure will now gone but or that it's all I got a a problem but what that is their stomach connected to one of my battery died or that or\nI think they're connected you know we had a cold similar list on the hotline\nI'm at a previous show\nBut I think this is where we this is the same problem that our friend vendor head was oh with his uh palate trucks why do you have to mention that because of what I was thinking of a bad experience for him and for us so it was a learning experience all expensive learning experience that was bought\nThis had the this was exactly same here same\nAs the fact that you guys had to pay for this and he had to pay for it it's going to help Hernandez 'cause you guys know not a\nFriend of ours for forty years helped solve your problem it would be something for only about two grand no uh it it could be you know it was about to rent it could be the same problem although you might have something different but it is worth checking into because we're aware\nThat this could be things so there is a device here's a path to look at the path to look at under the hood there's a thing called an F. C. M. a front control module you open the hood it's basically that fuse boxes on the driver's side fender\nUm [noise] they fail and when they fail that's what controls racy compressor everything's run them through that and you can lose\nThe compressor buddy can also kick in his you\nWould shut it off the compressor wouldn't work\nBut the really would kick in now and then engage that compressor and run the batteries that overnight and then when you drive down the road the compressor would not break when he tells the turn on it wouldn't turn to rely on and run the ac it and it just occurred like that overnight\nAnd the next day the batteries were dead and like what is going on and then we drove for a week no problem the batteries did not go dead but the compressor didn't work\nAnd then all of a sudden the compressor started working for the batteries went dead every night it was stuck on all the time\nIt turned out to be it was in that frontal control modules so how we diagnose it is we get the circuit diagrams and find out do I have any electricity\nVoltage coming out of that I've seen him to POWER UP that compressor and if we don't but we have a signal coming into it which we can read from our scanner and physically with a meter oh we know we got something going on in the module and then with the vehicle off\nJust check this out when you turn your vehicle off and you know it's probably going to be dead the next day see if your AC compressors engage if it's clicked on an engaged even though it doesn't work it might be turned on when the keys off\nAnd I think when I answered this call on a hotline called it was similar I think I brought up the power train control module instead of the front control module federal that uh I wasn't there not being hands\nOn I just knew that there was a module that was we had a thing on her now and go of although it's a it's a different image is it different module okay so I was wrong her name ... where are you listening to us in Texas\nThey're you know [laughter] 'cause it's a small gr up as like mine are but it's a it's a beautiful die cast there's a lot of collectors out there they've really voice their opinion of how much they liked the car and they've also think you told us that they like with filters so make sure you\nLike our Facebook page or go to under the hood show dot com go to our Facebook page Joyner who fan

they wouldn't instead of restrictive ... they're they're changing the duct tape or on it since they have different horse power they're changing the spoiler\nThey're going to really try to get the car back even further into the hands of the drivers okay I'm a big change is coming so we have to watch next got that here but\nYou know we should we should do to make NASCAR really interesting less at random once\nThe cars are already to go on the track like an official goes through and changes the cars\nThe only thing on the ends and change it's like\nWe've got a random drawing we've got a random

land Minnesota\nCongratulations Roger Portland Minnesota congratulations now let's talk to Justin Justin you're on the end of the show what can we do for ya\nOh thank you gentlemen for taking my call um this is basically a question and a cautionary tale I remember when I think last week about the idea of\nBeing careful when you started cars been sitting for a while so this is an idea of what can happen I have a Nineteen sixty five Mustang help restore with my dad probably starting Nineteen Ninety six I'm drove through high school\nAnd then after the ... you know starting college you know it doesn't have power steering or power breaks look I was a safe\nVehicle to drive most the time I only drove a once a week for maybe a ... or what's now once a year for a car show a this a few weeks ago I was planning on moving it needed to move it I'm Out of our outside shed to another area\nAnd so have the wife out there telling her ears are starting fluid and just try and do I remember my dad doing using starting foot up on the carburetor\nIt wasn't really starting I was kinda surprised about is starch right up\nI don't like on the way this how about going [laughter] yeah that's not even going to go\nThere haven't been crank I I started then it's kind of dying down by the outlet to start or stop all the way and started again and just have like a clerk and then now that I'm trained over even the wife was saying yeah it sounds much more grinding now you can still hear like turning over but the sound is completely\nDifferent got it and so like I'm trying to figure out now what do I do now I have met something up or what do I do how do I figure it out about this was going to be\nOh I Will ask ... first of all I thought no wife was gone I was waiting for a backfire array\nOf lots of starting fluid bathing and the writer yet I I cook got\nHealth insurance for the white man regulate horribly classics\nInsurance to cover the loss of the car a\nWhile so here's what I think happened as it was cranking you got to a backfire\nIn it and that put a huge load on that starter and either took some teeth off the flywheel or damage the starter and now when you crank it it's got that right now they're back on track instead of the nice moves I don't know how to make a smooth starting zone but\nAll the writing stories you can hear me that you ... and somebody there to like\nGrinding and you want to stop and is is this different sound\nLike that to me it sounds like it's still something is turning over like in the engine but it's almost like it's like something metal sitting inside of it could\nBe wrong I ... it seems different that would be\nHard to have happened but again I Would probably if you're concerned like that which it sounds like you are 'cause you called the national radio show or I Would remove the spark plugs\nAnd turn the engine over by hand by hand and see if you can feel anything and if you really concerned more scope looking cylinders see what you're seeing 'em maybe she really juice it up with the starting fluid which would be amazing\nBecause you go ... you could you could have ... that if she was just porn and then they're like crazy but usually that's definitely\nEvaporate evil that it's very common to damage starters on those you might even just pull the starter off and take a look at it because those soldiers are really easy to get off of those cars take it off and look at the teeth and the damage is one of my Model T I had the spark advanced little too far on it when I was first putting it back together and it uh\nIt backfired and broke the rope to start or on the fix that so you it's common we've had them in our shop where we've tried to crank up one cars weren't starting in the back fired when we're trying to get them going in when they backfire of a sudden the starter changes from one sound to a different did you have a backfire\n[noise] no no I I I was very surprised that it wasn't starting actually I mean normally are sorry for you know you put a little bit that in there it's going to start right up\nAnd I was turning it over quite a little bit and I was telling her you know don't just hold that was during floor just splits a little bit of time and I was really surprised that had actually started up because just a week before it had started well enough for me to drive to the to the shed and so\nYou know is it ... if you saw it at our wide\nNothing happened is the engine modified or is it stock\nI Believe the internal their stock um course has a different carburetor you know it's pretty up with some you ever bought shirt off covers things like that but the base engine self as stock it believe\nIs that enjoy a night that engine should be a free wheeling engine even if a valve got hung up it Ross it shouldn't impact a piston I'm that's what just makes me\nI guess I just start from scratch again and and your next step might be to just pull the spark plugs out and turn it over by hand and see if you feel anything and I I wouldn't discount the starter thing yet\nBecause ah it's it's ... it's possible Justin hold on a second I Want to talk about it like you're not really there for a second if this were you Shannon or us and you had to pick your wife to either and you're expecting it just to start right up if you hit the started flowed right would you have your wife in the car trying to start it or would you have are under the hood with started foot\nWouldn't want to do I I have done this before and I usually have her inside cranking while I'm under the hood on an older car working the throttle and the same time so all she has to do is turn the key or I'll just get myself a screwdriver and hit the ... side\nNot a good idea I uh I Would have a crank okay\nYou'd have her in the house while you were under the hood with a screwdriver would\nKnow she'd come on crank would you know yeah\nUm and I didn't I don't have I didn't know it might turn into a why didn't you stop cranking that's Idaho when I hear I hear you I imagine aided ending poorly no matter what but I'd rather have\nHer in their ... ruining it\nWouldn't be mindful of land and catch on fire they felt they were a little bit of an art to the spray you know it's a it's a ... and then he said you got to get a ... so you know I was there a thought but ... but ah as to who would do what they are just\nYou know there was the idea is I'm always afraid that you're getting a going by no it might not idle long enough for me to jump in switched places with her since\nIt's for speech transmit shoveling on that and get this\nGoing the tires are holding air very well we've got to get this thing moving to a small little shed\nSo it's like honey as soon as this thing starts up throw that air cleaner on shoes it's pretty easy threw on put the lid down the down a little bit I'm off to move it really quick that was my whole thought process and she doesn't drive stick shift at\nThe time I guess it makes total sense now that you're saying that way I thought Justin thanks very much for the call 'cause it would have it would have gone in my case and well\nIt was what was already going why did you still get a phone neutral and blonde we'll or something I'm going to open this\nCar sounds like it'd be perfect classics for sure that'll do it for another hour of the end of the show until

I think that's going to be a sneaky electric cars in eighty seven or eighty ... excellent condition\nSo what kind of do you have a boost gauge what are you reading for PSI on\nThe hell it goes up to about seven\nOn us if you've got that and it's actual is an electronic\nNation is seven to ten but I'm Wondering as far as a\nDifferent things that was the same motor they put basic seemed set up in an eighty four eighty five must then yes the ...\nWith the two three turbulent they're supposed to get I mean you should be able to feel I Can't remember the rating was but it seems to me it was like two hundred and fifty horsepower to Seventy two forty somewhere in there it was pretty ... which is by today's standards\nPretty low do you have a mechanical boost gauge on here or is that electronic\nWell it's it's just looks like it's electronic it just is it the fact I've agers look at the\nGauge and it's just a [noise] when you accelerate it registers tenet pops into that seven to ten range from the other side of the gauge so I assume it's\nSo let's so you've kept the gauges out of the forward and put in there\nWell I bought it from a a friend in Montana and I uh [noise] just trying to to get it to where should perform better that's one of the other problem than I Am trying to workout is but it's got a\nFeisty but it has kind of electric connection to the transmission but then it's going to a ... of course but um so that's not working out either so that's\nAn easy fix our our friends have been able to tell me how to our friends the Dakota digital make a box or that you can convert and they\nSell a ton of them yeah so this box is a pretty small if you'd stacked about three Dexter cards together it's about that size and on one side of it it's got a ground ... missions which wire that go through missions which\nAnd then it has to wires coming in from that electric speed censor or one way or depending on your system from your transmission that you've got 'em that Ford\nAnd then on the other side it's got your screw on cable that hooks to any kind of screw ... be you know what the old screw on cable screws on the one into the box and then the electric motor drives\nAnd if the spin amateur wasn't accurate it's adjustable inside you can change the ratio calibration ... so you can get your speed just right on that one I Believe you just drive is like a fifty five push a button on it and it ...\nThat that was what I Would need I think to make that way because I Would I Would go oh I can switch any time and I don't want to drive all the way over there to switch\nYeah they just said that they are in in California where they did their pilots they had little demand\nUm many that signed up canceled after one or two months and they have no plans to discontinue the programs says but they're gonna have to altered a little bit mhm uh they've been surprised how few people are genuinely interested in the ... in this type of ownership Robert Parker Lincoln's director of marketing sales and service pulled automotive news in Lincoln ...\nIf you'd asked me a year ago I would've said this is the next big thing a lot of people are struggling and make the math work\nIt seems like for a while they're in it and maybe it's just in my selective memory of of a whole condensing a whole year into a smaller amount of time or something but\nThere was a while they were we were talking every week about subscriptions or this company is a driverless car this company's electric there doesn't seem to be that is it because those are just started now and we're seeing what happens and it just seems like that stuff is all driverless stuff or did my Facebook algorithm change what knowledge that I had this\nI saw a drastic drop in the autonomous a ... type stuff which a lot of the electric were autonomous stuff that we're kind of one hand in hand we saw big drop when the when the deaths occurred remember\nThe nickel and ... part of it I just I I think a little bit I think a lot of it has to do with the political climate that's there's all kind of partner together all about the science is that when he was a political climate and and that just in general the narrative ... years ago was\nYeah I mean there's ... there's more of a push to say you know what let's get these auto manufactures a chance to develop something with the internal combustion engine let's you know let's look at the raw materials differently and and the news\nThe news changes so fast and we've got so much other garbage to be news stuff right now\nThe man who just who cares about car do I want to do a story on autonomous cars we don't have time we're just doing breaking news this half hour yeah [laughter] where it is right now we're just going alive but if you're an eight six six five nine for for one five oh that's a number you can call twenty four hours a day\nI this is Joe and I've been in Redmond, Oregon\nI've got a few thousand three for three fifty six liter powers go when I'm gone over forty five miles an hour and I'm just open the throttle at a certain position just to hold the\nLaws just kinda falls on its face but as soon as I wrote my vote on it\nDried off rounds real good wondering if you had any ideas on that\nIt could be a or there's tons of things that can do it but it's it sounds like you may I'm One of the first places we'd start looking at her shop would be at the fuel system in that\nBecause if you've got a an issue where it can't provide proper fuel delivery whether it's the actual fuel flow or a problem with the fuel control like an injector or ... or something like that it can give you that lug at a real light\nThrottle but then when you hammer down on it it dumps it in and it goes\nAnd feel flow is an important issue on any diesel and for a lot of folks that go into performance diesel that's one of the things they have to modify\nIs the fuel flowed they'll add a fuel proper raider or different things to fuel system to make sure that they always have\nA solid consistent non ... flow of fuel\nComing into the system and or sometimes even a a crack in a in a fuel filter housing or a can cause problems like this and it's a base issue that can have a result that might turn on some sort of a trouble later things like that but it's it's more in the uh I guess the the the general running of the engine\nAnd when it gets underneath that extra pressure and needs to push that air through and bring into fuel\nYou start reaching the end of that are real quick and you need to make sure that fuel flows is proper and that's that's where I Would start\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh\nI get the on from South Dakota ... or an F. one fifty four or five four and all that long day break that they can do a whole lot tried to get going again will ship that if there's a little even having trouble getting moving and\nWhat about you codes fell out of these is bad change if you get out the old greats another two days and it's a little situation and what does that mean\nThat sounds super fun when when you think you fix it and it happens again two days later no wet or Chris everybody wants to think that right yeah absolutely they\nThey were going yeah yeah said oh what I did was great all I had to do was unplugging plug it back\nIn and then it comes back and it's the fleeting feeling of All right I didn't spend any time diagnosing this I was just part darting it mhm should I not even he should I'm holding a few should I really have expected to get it fixed that not really there's there's something going on yeah I ... it could\nAnything could happen on those we've seen some of them with water\nThat come in that they've had leaky windshields on them they'd get into the electronics we've cut have problems the fuse boxes with that that's one thing we've seen on we've seen issues with transmission wearing harnesses shorting in those causing issues that both uses and if you replace a fuses and then you still have the issue or worked for a little bit\nWhen they'll shorts occur they can cause problems the transmission control modulate Eighteen year old vehicle how it's going to be this could be one that's going to be difficult to diagnose probably when a fused blows how often is it the fuses fault\nI I don't know I've ever seen a few fail and less the fuse had water something to cause to corrode\nOkay it just can't think of that to where the connection was bad for the few had fuses ... you put a meter on and still had a it's\nStill a continuity through it he was still doing its job it was completing a circuit I remember growing up we we had fuses in our house and we just\nBlown constantly because there was like\nAn upstairs views [laughter] we had little
