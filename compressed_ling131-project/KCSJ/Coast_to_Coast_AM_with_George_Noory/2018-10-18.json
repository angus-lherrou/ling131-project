{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "Well the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama\nUm federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em and let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of\nCrony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this was a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said as making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair debt collection practice laws federal um\nA fruit in lending laws are and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when the company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under than the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth than lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year\nWell I can guarantee you ... ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really string the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\n... there was a story just recently we're losing\nA guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a no bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nIs really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right now we're gonna check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give us a call if you've got a question give us a call if you're an instructor at a university and you want us to give us your feedback on that give us a call as well we'll be back in a moment with Ellen call engineer phone calls right here on the coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am happy is now available for I don't know Android ... listen live on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloading today\n\n[noise]\n\n\nFive Ninety dot com [noise]\nSeventeen what's now in the ... hour radio I mean I have a radio broadcast media\nIn a brand new episode with a legendary sir Paul McCartney no arming treat bolted down with Joel leaving the talking about his new album Egypt vision in of course some discussion about a little band called the ... we were when we were playing music I her radios inside the studio by checking out no\nOn the radio on the Web to five Ninety case yesterday dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans game what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three ... and um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance et cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there was to lungs is falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is\nWhat happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall you know a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed\nI might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later [laughter] and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or the other gear mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got the student loan situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look how great reviews you go and do you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and in fact is really what's going on with\nStudent loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so\nIs these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\n... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with\nThe the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more in schools but um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories where people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars she's crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job\nOr maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well you know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you\nGeorge got good news for you to a stroke rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they throw\nSupport the seals\nThere he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it but\nUh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to\nA ... a former company I used to work where I got on big wildly when a company went under the under the ... the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know that it was a sad time for a company that pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I'm looking for the job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let me thanks as well as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too well\nAnd I think also for years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local schools they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up feeling now unless ... ... dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that it's not up for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools well\nYou know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon in Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending\nUm and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize\nThe loans especially the taxpayer on her um it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college did\nOkay I already knew the doping at ... says but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the the ... conservative everyone knows\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Yellen these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship for any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private bank and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that to mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program\n... bunch of government programs out there that sounds like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment but\nWhat all everybody out there needs to know is that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you\nWork for a you know if you work in a\nCollege or a hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it so\nThe rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're going to come back and take final culture with you in just a moment Iran coast to coast am\nGoes insiders maneuvering the

was going to ask if you heard of this company or and\nAgain to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and this sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in default that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow they're George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nHuh that job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans in the fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed\nA breakdown of all of the costs that I've ever heard and I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the video he do try to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for each are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies I'm the owner of your loan is ...\nProbably either a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise] so I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with the question of you know like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information Allen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public jak clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government so so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so I definitely\nRecommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nThat my friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you've never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead [laughter] and\nWhen you release down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having such limitations you can follow you literally to the great\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nProblem [laughter] not at all that one once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it off

I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially a ... minute documentary that I put out to tell the story and\nYour credit gram but to your life that story and and really to try one human tree tell as fast as I can tell that story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with this\nPhenomenon what seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are staggering this town that they have been the biggest thing go wherever they are in the UFO community I think that the only story that I think come\nAnd I would say this is the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that after decades of didn't know the U.S government did have a new effort right Graham often when it was run by the ... super secretive\nDefense intelligence agency and they feel that the day and you're like hey oh yes they said no no since project we close down we haven't been doing this in traffic or no investigation and of course\nThey were and what do I really focused on in in the film aliens and again to try\nTo train angle the humor is a threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf treatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this Robert Bigelow Senator Harry Reid told the long and you could make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nThink the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story\nIn one sense for years people have said the\nProblem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out will to first than a\nThan a third one but now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then this this rock star guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having brought in a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about feel a lot in due course tonight specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on the one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seeds and and you've done this of course as alien times yourself you know you sit in the hot seat a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this and when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so I scripted the entire movie I did the I wrote a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and ... in that way\nI have absolute control of this and then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing\nAnd and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along\nI but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFor mayor dates a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a\n... a great movie but um you know I I was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to\nTalk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't get too many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to the platforms\nThat the young people you watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization M E T\nRight yes I Am well that's a very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well he always says in these sorts of\nSituations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a deeply trying to build a leak driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the Pentagon um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so we'll at least by these people were skeptics are told\nThey would believe those but they would you believe us in some some great Warren happen with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back and jet more right here on the coast to coast or you\nKnow you can do to do with other ...

could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nSong ... coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house\nArmed services committee have been looking for is the ... ... have been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the whiter question oh you ate pays more generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative\nAmy power I think it was a has had some discussions with the\nChair of the uh science technology and space committee and the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of don't fight about that I mean that's another point if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolve into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology in space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly you know it was a military and intelligence program and I I just\nCan't see how you would get it\nOut of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks\nAnd it terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's bad so so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I applied some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be I'm happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think it's it's bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that are actually going into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nNot bothering us one us or no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster who's out there doing what they do to get the word on their\n... absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately only go the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with aliens and again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes right you're right in documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published\nIn the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nIntegrate on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my own feeling the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed services\nCommittee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering that have before articles I've seen about this or for the immigration one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of a twenty five to thirty year olds in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety eight percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course all of the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in

defense secretary crowned the thirty three year old crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman or all denying that this was the Saudi Government operation which means it's going to be very difficult\nIf they continue to deny that\nFor us to implement any type of sanctions against Saudi Arabia and frankly George I think this news story it's going to die and an ceremony as death in ... in another few days when that comes out\nAnd then say joy Howard blooms theory John he thinks turkey might have been involved in order to create some disruption what do you think\nNo I I think that uh you know the ... we we don't have to you know really leap ... any other conclusion of the show he was a disgruntled Saudi citizen that was ... you you know was being exploited by beach house\nAnd the Washington Post which is you know is a is a hit man kind of paper where you just if you're if you're anti anything special anti Trump or anti Saudi ... he certainly got a forum for the kind of invective\nThat he engaged in denouncing the Saudi Government for the last few years and I I think they deal with with a ex pats he wasn't exactly an act path but he was certainly living outside the country\nAre you know in a very harsh way and I think they got him\nWhat's new online columnist dot com\n... showcase now I have five articles posted it on his show gave themselves\nAnd of course we also ah you know dealt with this latest meltdown in the stock market recently which I think for a lot of people out of fourteen hundred point nosedive and I told people and you know this article you don't get a get a little bit of a clue\nAs to how our Wall Street operates every time the markets in flight to a point where share prices are unaffordable for the fun the fun to take profits\nAnd they drive the prices down to a point where they hit a new bottom and then the markets trip back up\nSo and yes yes there are geo political concerns there's interest rates there's all kinds of excuses why the markets cell thought but the bottom line is George these major funds in order to cake profit periodically sell off and people should know that\nAll right John thank you so much for your input working long hours

YouTube owned by Google went down for several minutes around seven twenty pm after what seemed like eons\nYouTube finally released a statement on the issue saying it wasn't clear at the time what it costs the outage but that about thirty to forty minutes later the website was restored our expert on the Internet Lauren Weinstein weather's floor and what do you think happened\nYeah Google isn't going to get into the technical details of this the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty much weird\nWell it it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video streams to people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so the fact that this was a global out it suggests that there was some kind of access related problem centrally that caused this in my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I were to YouTube dot com or you normally get all those little thumbnail\nIt would just get the shadows with typically appeared before the video ... that was the it wouldn't actually get the video [noise]\nSo uh it's an interesting ... interesting kind of situation apparently uh there were people tracking where everyone when when they couldn't access YouTube but I guess one of the porn sites got a big spike\nSpike in activity there\nI guess you'd expect somebody of some of the other other sites to [noise] um but but it's an interesting kind of thing and I'm sure the post mortem the post ...\nYou go because of the internal you're going to be are going to be pretty interesting\nUses a sign of the times Lauren when the Internet goes down\nIt well keep in mind you're you're too is a norm is I mean the scale of YouTube is is that\nOh it's huge we've got our own coast to coast YouTube channel I mean it's a big\nRight so the fact that it's large means that you know clearly this is one of the quote shouldn't be able to have unquote kind of problem\nOr the other hand as big as it is it is it the entire Internet it it is a very specialized kinds of applications [noise]\nSo I don't think that's necessarily says anything about the Internet at large but it does kind of make you remind it does remind you that there are central point that are potentially points of difficulty for the Internet they're designed to avoid large scale breakdown but for example if you have\nProblems with a DNS you can have difficulty numbers of people being affected and you always have to wear your building these systems you always have to think about those well just couldn't happen kinds of possibilities because sometimes they do\nSometimes they do

millions of Americans whose lives have been\nTruly ruined by the practices of student loan lenders he's the author of the student loan scam the most impressive debt and you and history and how we can fight back he's also been selected as one of the seven financial heroes by money magazine back in two thousand nine and here he is back on coast it goes Alan welcome back my friend\nOh yard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans doors they've gotten worse I bet\nOh hell yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and\nI think I was on about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab which is now a sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nUh they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive in the bottle or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so a thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the\nWhat the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that that's right yeah\nUm you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully the government hopes going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about a four ten months typically none of those\nPayments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents I can get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nShe's in the ... these agents are collection companies well yeah these\nAgents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency a and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nUh than alone there remains in good stead and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate\nThey default again three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happened something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allan let's talk

I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair debt collection practice laws federal um a fruit in lending laws [noise] ah and\nThese again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of\nBankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] ah like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private\nYou lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treated lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUh so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you absolutely have to borrow go to a private bank at a private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because we then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan whatever\nHappened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year\nWell I can guarantee you now you're per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for a four year course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the cat burglar seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really string the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\nThere was a story just recently we're losing a guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high that's right\nYou know and and just really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses killing entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give us a

[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to close to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loan scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans and um\nI graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there was too long just falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to fall so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboo and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy is it out when the people who have a rough credit or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed\nBe the ones that get the short end of the stick in by that I mean you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got the student loan situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll financed them\nWith just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor persons in the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans\nIt's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with\nStudent loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so\nIs these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know\nDisadvantaged uh under privileged people ... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and\nThey're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very rural\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the\nNumber I mentioned for Syracuse early as probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so that you get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollar she's crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge\nA and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you George I got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and laugh at it on the other day yeah there was a big signs they throw at least according to seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to\nA ... a former cub there used to work or I got trained on equality and when a company went under the under the conflict in a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I looked at her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing\nWell and I think also for a couple of years and\nYou probably in more and more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go it for oh I think it was a two month course there's no well you know it's like there is no way\nSo I ended up going unless ... ... dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price of\nA let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think of trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call\nI Want to publicly thank gallon he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I

other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy right back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a very close to me like like what you describe\nHow did they get the information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so I\nRecommend I'm getting to the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you've never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very

Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nAnd there there are two issues than us direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care isn't some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah there are some of the states that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and its time because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut are trying to to do it themselves they are ... ... they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expand Medicaid to people the way of Obamacare intended to\nDo these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's some been some pushback\nFrom state officials in some of those states and one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative includes a way to pay for the state's share of expansion of federal government pays her most of the costs of the state does have some ... a portion of the cars\nAnd in Maine which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe government has refused to go along in part because the funding issue so in Utah they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock by including a funding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative from\nHow similar or the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in ... Idaho Nebraska in Utah\n[noise] ... the main threats as a saying that the Affordable CARE Act allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people up to earn enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um\nThis is an issue one reason it still I'm practically and as an issue in states is there's a lot of pressure from hospitals particularly rural hospitals and other medical medical providers in these states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country one argument for why that is happening by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials the Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voters say we want this and there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen graphic Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece in total myth germs healthcare is a key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nIt potentially to their Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho has worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a form with healthcare reporters that he thinks if these initiatives these ballot initiatives in these states passed that it it could start a trend for the rest of the states that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs some states that haven't expanded Medicaid conservative states have been asking the Trump Administration for permission to do so but I Do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates ready for it will care I don't like such as ah imposing work requirements and that's another issue that's at play some states might be willing to extend medicate if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're seeing that for example in um Kentucky okay\nYou've written to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races to have an effect on this right\nRight that that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about and it's just because the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have the say in it there's in the state legislatures do too but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\nWe do to I'm trying to I guess the federal government money would there be guaranteed that would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written but one of the arguments that are opponents of I'm expanding Medicaid I'm One of the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee you can't guarantee the states that that funding will be there forever [noise]\nUm so they their their argument is that if states get dependent on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to its bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion than states you're going to be on their own ...\nMaureen Maureen grumpy Washington correspondent at USA Today twenty minutes in front of the hour now on this morning Americas burst news [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "18"}
