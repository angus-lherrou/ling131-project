B. E. R. R. Y. just kept flashing in my dream\nHe's an artist Disney\nI knew know of no such person I woke up I looked up on the Internet\nAnd he's a very accomplished artist who painted for decades whose purpose is to paint about human intention things that words can't talk about and I struggled for words and writing my book\nAnd I said to myself I'm just going to call him so I picked up the phone I left a voicemail few days later he called back we ended up on the phone for three hours a few months later I went to visit him in his studio and a few months after that\nHe painted for me a portrait of my son\nThat's the picture I see in the book\nYes that is the last great picture age of the book yes\nGreat pictures\nYou know I agree with the gentleman I think that our thoughts are in tension I think it is all part of a fabric that we don't perceive I don't think that location is significant in this realm time space there is no locality there's no other way his name could have found its way to me\nChristine is with us from Graham, Washington now west of the Rockies Hi Christina\n... can you hear me okay yeah\nWe sure can thank you\n[noise] um my my mother passed away about five years to go and her parents have links on February twenty second and oh about a year after she pat I noticed and bowling and he went to ... I was eating them or to twenty two\nUm matter of fact he took care of first card tonight at twelve twenty two\nFrom pat in Seattle yeah at the time um my watch quit working about ... you know and you're trying to um if I glance over at the ... you know a time and it'll be nine times out of ten to twenty\n[laughter] you know my dad's birthday was to twenty two as well\n... yeah ... I broke my hip in July and I was putting them to twenty two um [noise] it's just amazing\nAnd just keeps popping up all over for you\nYeah at least ... dropped my you know minor be on the clock on again on playing my high school or at least one again in at number\n... G Jonathan how do we explain this how do you explain this to people who are non believers in all this who might say oh you just tap ... what do you say to them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that\nBut I often start with I happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists and the infinite realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question\nAnd often that stop someone because one can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there to your to your brain\nJohn do you believe in God\nI Believe in a higher power I Believe in a higher wisdom I Believe in a higher form of energy that I find that there's no other explanation for all of us\nWere you angry with a higher power when this happened\nYou know George I'm I wasn't and\nI really have had a hard time getting angry I have found the most comfort and accepting the flow if you will that has come my way\nAnd my hope is my sense is that this flow has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details for but if I go with it rather than fight it it makes my days a lot easier\nWhat message would you have for somebody drawn who's going through the same thing you went through\nThe message I Would say would be when it gets really really dark that's where you find something that's really really light\nAnd it sounds like you have devoted your lifestyle to this mission of getting the word out about what happened to ... the dangers of some of these medicines and of course what's on the other side don't stop right\nI I I don't intend to I Am I Am definitely devoted to communicating what happened to him but at a higher humanistic level they're George there are a lot of people that have a lot of pain and in that pain my message to people is there's a lot of white you just have to look for it\nOr John thanks for getting the best job

who really doesn't need a major introduction the mold and our Gore's award winning journalist\nAnd she's been with us since the beginning of this program ... dot com and she's got a series of very special programs starting with planted acts story Linda the just the just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and they need becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported her files dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcasts then\nThat a new ninth planet or planet act was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the ... cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shape residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the ... cloud of mostly ice and us goes much further starting where the type rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth\nAnd the spirit of shape that surround our entire solar system including the Khyber belt\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at Meyer files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere and now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving\nIn a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply calls the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades and\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argue that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the ... Subaru observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown\nSays that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying to mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune a good way out there but they have narrowed down the focus so he has deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the solution is up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected also the upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nUsing it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system's perturbations and even just in the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where it looks I suspect the men once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing enough direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like ... and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like ... you know five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say planted in the other part of the solutions to\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where my does have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud and\nYou talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or not they were inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out by Saturn or Jupiter like do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has all of this is just speculation\nYou can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with this now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure 'cause we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what the border of\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a\nFace to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'm saying that for conversations and Linda because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat ... even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a planet but when you read like say about the ... through scholar translation that we're a card game\nAnd you look at the carving one thing that always\nConfusing to me talking about Trump planet but

can have devastating consequences\nRight now where computer models showing to do is have you worked on the PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nations the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming but\nUnfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which was or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger and forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got ... million of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken root now in Washington\nTo pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we it was for years ago\nTo global climate change in increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer\nOf twenty Eighteen million for at home may see the level rise flooding

thirty PM mountain and another time around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight\nIn front of it and it hurt to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on three category first had it with\nThe very distressing subject how cat had a cat\nAround the world like\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was ... and a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspot seller observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually a child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatory computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range and how an air force base\nOr download the solar observatory nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then third update had evolved from my asking my or fires YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth anyone had young childhood memory flooding out of body\nUgly I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I have a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone before and what are we talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth floor a Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan\nSaw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream [noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a come like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked a that second week I asked my er files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office\nAnd uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky fog\nIs it like act applies them I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mention any of the parents to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this\nIs provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream\nThat's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazards are talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now some city center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the coverage of all my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty\nGray ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen the fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with this living\nThat was surrounding me and\nThen at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and\nI don't know why this was happening

so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announcing there at the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred\nAnd thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go down\nYou know I guess not but consumer reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most

out on a balcony to have a smoke and he became aware of the fact that something was directly above his head he looked up and he estimates not more than fifty or a hundred feet above him there was a triangular crowd\nWith orange and red lights on the trail a an edge of it and they flashing he could see later on in the site in a flashing bright red light\nOn the a dorsal surface of the object very interesting sighting after the first object he saw moved to the east towards Winston Salem reports\nHe realized that there was a second one above it headed a different direction added to the north instead of east and the second or two later you realize there was a third similar looking object in the night sky or make them in the morning sky this was six o five am\nOn Tuesday of this week the twenty third of October very interesting report and he's provided for a very nice illustrations that are posted to our website\nThe third report comes from Rockford, Illinois a woman reports that

looking at a clear night sky look into the northeast like the first report a ball of white light came down out of the north the sky it apparently surprised him considerably\nIt's strict towards him it made he estimates a Ninety degree turn to the west\n... street to the west he estimates a thousand miles an hour although it's very difficult death and made the actual speed of an object in the night sky\nAnd it suddenly turned down and disappeared from his I find a building so a lot going on and all that the last report I've shared here are posted to our website\nTalk to you next week Peter have

going to ... a very special programs starting with planted ... story Linda the just just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and they paint becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast then\nThat a new ninth planet or planet act was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the art cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a shape residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system of creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and us goes much further starting where the hype rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth\nAnd fear Ikle shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at ... dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProtests are brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called ... out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our shipping downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to dwarf planet in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever\nIs out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to collector together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the tech and super ... territories in Hawaii defined planet nine and visible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this Louis save planet nine or planted act that he is\nUh is held trying to mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to the big bang theory math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculation place on the body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like ... times further than napkin a good way out there but they have a narrow down okay so yeah there were only going on November first started another surge because the new calculation\nGreat did that planet nine is core to a car elation that can only be seen by American I in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California it struck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the consolation is up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date when you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbation an even keel seeing the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet\nIt'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might does have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but until we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the or clout\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers or\nJust the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point we'll announce the existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away so we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] so January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it'll take a one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat there you have it during an right from the man is covered in terms of those ...\nOf those half a dozen bodies that are all kinds of gathered together at where the guy prevailed in a cloud in that area\nAnd I think one of the most important part of doing the research project with these scientists is that I had no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury aside and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and Iran is our biggest put a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hype about\nThat there's nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity\nThat that's the thing about gravity and now it it would have impact on every single thing and\nThat's when we I would've loved those Zacharias itching to have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would've been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a face to face eye to\nEye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that Brenda because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be math have planted but when you read like say about the ... through scholar I did that translation that we're a car and\nDone and you look at the carving one thing that always is\nConfusing to me is talking about a Trump planet but

I don't know a few years back\nYeah I think it was just before the into doubt the sixty before the election and then in early twenties Seventeen we had a series that rice and being bailed the people\nAnd rice and seem to be the male of choice for more than a couple of years 'cause if you remember right after nine eleven I think there were some that would be bailed out too and then here probably five six years ago there was a bunch and that it never really call down\nSo what do you do I mean how do you protect yourself if you think you might be targeted in some way shape or form with something suspicious in the mail\nWell the first thing you need to do is look at the fact that you're enveloped or whatever it is you're going to get in the mail or by delivery service and she who is sending it to you if you're not expecting a package from that individual\nThen you probably should call them ... ... email whatever the case may be and say hey you sent me an act of something and if they say no and there is a different side is something wrong with the packages that have been mailed to CNN and all the political\nFigures you know the name the return address was wrong her name which

services\nAnd so on are going to have different people from time to time coming in but it it has been my experience\nIn the past that the delivery people coming into office buildings manufacturing plants or whatever are generally the same person day after day after day unless that person is on vacation if they come in and it's a different person you know it may you know where's second such\nYou know if they said he's on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air aside for it I gotta go gotta go gotta go yeah then there could be an issue with that because they're trying to get out of the building as fast as they possibly can\nAre these days um most of us are in this see something say something mode hopefully right but uh if there's something that I don't know just strikes you as odd what do you do I mean you could call nine one one right away you alert building security line and what's what's the

than any other TV market in the country rounding up the top ten advertising hotspots Las Vegas Tucson\nTampa Minneapolis Orlando Denver LA Reno and Miami work collectively more than three hundred million dollars has been spent since Labor Day on broadcast TV\nBy candidates is the story by Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic part of the u._s._a. today network Ron give it some numbers\nSo Phoenix the T the TV market a forty one thousand ads on just broadcast television that doesn't include all the cable channels as well so it's even worse than it sounds a but we are the number one marketed in the country that turned out for these\nPolitical ads and you know as I noted in the story if you think that it may be\nBetter in Tucson for example there are actually number three they have over thirty thousand so Arizona's really kind of getting bombarded with political messaging\nBoy and the majority of the ads feature what races you\nKnow the Senate race here is he is really the big one a this is the race between Democrat cures cinema and Republican Mark and mix Sally which one of the last crudely competitive wages on the map it looks like right now\nSo it was a universally fought well financed and uh had its share of sort of ugly messages from both sides but especially alarmist messages from the mix Sally allied caps\nAre those are my layman's observation near the nasty ones tend to get exhausting after a while or are focused saying to you that I'm okay enough already can we fast forward the calendar November six\nYou know somebody posted a great tweet on this they said you know practically begging for a car commercial [laughter]\nI Know I mean that's what it's come to where we're just like we're we're tired of this people are like skipping TV they're just sitting it out for the next couple of weeks\nOr they're tired of this messaging it is you know no surprise the messages are almost overwhelmingly negative in all the way the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start\nAnd uh you know people here have seen that across the board on for us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we're are increasingly politically competitive states so\nThis is something that we've seen politics get ugly bookstore but it didn't you know\nCar carpet bomb us this way now we are definitely seeing a lot more action on both sides\nWell speaking Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic get A's essential dot com they're part of the USA Today a network\nHe's got a piece about how Phoenix has just been overwhelmed with political ads this election year um you mentioned to kind of more broadly this has been significantly sharper increased over the last midterm election was that the measurement\nYeah it it's a compared to the midterms even compared to twenty sixteen we're seeing a lot more action than what\nWe're accustomed to and I think it's again a reflection of the stage growing political value or on the board\nOr Arizona used to be just a solidly Web stakes it might still be a red state but it's a far lighter huge to use those Democrats feel pretty optimistic about their chapters in a number of house races again the Senate races greenery too close to call\nAnd so we are just a you know inundated with these ads are overwhelmingly negative and a in a lot of different races a lot of different corners of the state\nKendall lower ballot candidates actually get air time or they squeezed out at times by the ... the Senate and governor's race\nYou know I think that they can they can get on the fact is that they just don't have as much financial power to do it so at any price they would have been relatively low walk in a campaign you know we have a Democrats running for example in in each house waves\nAre they are challenging guts move for us and ah these are some times low budget affairs are we even have some Republicans running in places where they don't normally rod and so you know they are at least a contested leans races\nBut again these folks are are pretty far away from having a TV money at any great quantity\nAnybody saying that the saturation or perhaps consistent negativity can actually work against a candidate or is it a TV is king and candidates are going with it\nYou know look at people who actually hate negative advertising but the fact is it does sort of help define your opponent and so people still do it it's still leaves an impression with voters and the question is whether there's enough there to put someone down close enough that\nWhatever you
