called the ... skin test and it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people\nAnd the the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents met experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your\nBrain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects and they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nHe also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for them\nI ... matter the classic study\nUses random number generators these machines that spit out heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once as heroes\nAgain what do we find is that there is a mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic and in people that people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround events that we know a producer heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a hunting trip basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to use a bench ... keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said doll which trickery its magic\nBut they do believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\n\nWell I've heard of of food and bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller back then and\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her\nVery interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is\nA result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo\nYou know there has been a lot of debate about him but the documents suggest that studies were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that town totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website in where people can get your book\nShore my website is my name mark over M.

J. lo\nMy feet are on your phone\nTaps for lunch ... hand Fox News or again Michael very close to a category for hurricane strength\nBack Marc ... with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking\nI'm Glad you brought this up towards this is a really really important one because if if there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond loosen nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't see with our eyes\nBut I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known as ... active cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest their resuscitated and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one the real scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma\nIn many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stops after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid\nOut of body experience where he heard something in the room it\nWas later found to be that the federal later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this new doesn't experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then the ... the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experiencing memories\nOf but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson is one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that their room\nYou can't see those radio signals once they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic\nYou've learned a lot I haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can\nIt let's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut Connecticut bill by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational eighth year than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going I just think regarding and he's\nIn ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be\nSeeing your lab already know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically a I like to sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications\nMedications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nFact chemical have the brain\nAnd therefore they do affect chemical you the consciousness meaning of the mind so\nBy changing biologically biochemical you the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain is through the headaches the going back to cite made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in effect the mind that's my first part my second part\nOf the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the mines does thing that show it\nHere's my question for you it doesn't that show that if the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\n\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's a simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when\nWhen I mentioned in my book imagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire\nSo I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness damage the brain you you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhat ... what do you think mark reincarnation well I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have\nTalked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things\nUnless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the UCA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow and hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and yeah I have a question for

is more than ...\n...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there are ... there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being researched widely enough to understand if there are certain trend or a certain brand configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world for an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part

they're reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYes even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening mhm\n[noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness\nNow I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance\nBecause he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nSo there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do I get ... this is open me out completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again one more time you bought your Web

far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nThe official which obsessed with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control the gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very\nA wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in a city and she still is on she's known as you know the high priest ... salmon and feel often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed and her her guide and very regal looking very um you know she's big presents for ... and ... at\nThe time to people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcome her with open arms but let's just say the town Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at\nThose days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believe in the witchcraft and um so basically\nShe did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right Fidel type of ... and then it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of him\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about we back to your family you said this ability what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you want to scare me she gets\nYou know my father though he thought the girls in the same\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was saying and I mean it was normal I did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her I should say are here some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal um but she didn't really\nDisgusted with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in there and he finally told me that he is you know what Marlene ... from my family for many many years\nLike her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from\nBleeding and you're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio so would\nYou say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um\nBut my great grandmother my grandmother rather I didn't know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people who I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town on so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the others that you could carry through\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy um and my ...\nJoke about it and say that that you know ... that was her true self she was very unique because that's what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story\nAfter on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing you know and go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individuals that you know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get a you go out and you look for the things that go on for the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so\nIt's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house just losing\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise] um so I really believe that\nThere are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nMore than you conclude about what this may be are we a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nYou know door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stress from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\nWhen you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a gravestone did you actually think you know here's a person who lived and died\nAnd you know ... or right here in ... attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually you know you talk about\nThe loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and that's ours and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nOh I see it as much as you probably try to try to stay focused\n... you know you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so it can you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions\nMoney it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest thing you've come across strangers skis\nStranger case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time he would never tell me where we were going on because it's the keep me honest right so I'm not Googling\n...\nUm the one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take an hour\nYou know ha ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm sure Iran\nYou know he's very creative right so I said oh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home it's just you know little ranch style house and we we get there and if that's meant to guys there wanted they just look really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like run I think his name was moose and the big\nBig guy covered in tattoos I mean just tried it you know\nJust overwhelming\nRight to sit there and so why is just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the merits of shattered in glass table busted and it just looked like someone went through the house with a bat um it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've\nMy phone's been ringing with all the roads on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all these things and he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes I'm thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I talked\nTo use and brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm\nElites run up at the top of the driveway with the guy news any rags me down on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in\nSomething that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary and we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast\nDi di

[laughter] tossing him at you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but there was just the ...\n... ... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... or did\nNot by the by the living room\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is more goes ... is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation it was a daytime investigations jumped him and call me up and asked me the check out his house so I gather ... up and we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... uh and the the kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of them moved separated me from the other one and the other one talked to my rain we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he won a marine comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's\nOne that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very ... on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people but more of a piece of equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um you know tried to\nBring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a\n... and being seen you might bring more video equipment or you know like thermal or I or whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies a port and we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization go visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that they weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nWork with a lot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions or one guy do this goes to his 'cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these hard to tourists\nAnd one time we were in the um [noise]\nIt's a like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and sees windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and it was one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she go halfway down to the side of the ... you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself as she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for like a surrogate generally walk all the way to do it and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I it's her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my bill to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat ... is with the ... got it because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reports and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing um\nPerhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes on ah what Iowa lighthouse in that pool meal Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was on\nUm renovation at that time it was sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen look towards the kitchen I search dog all crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their\nClaws on the yeah yeah the the there was no it was founded out\nSo I jumped up and meal you're in the kitchen and when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says right would you see that's that's our dog she says she described sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know run there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die white housekeepers afterward took care of him till the dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nBecause she has a dog that bit of that dog and I did see a picture that looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean these two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me at the upper Russia\nWhen it's still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both of you are old

Maureen would our final segment here funnel calls more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a very wary Amazon and uh all the major bookstores\nUh towards the matrix\nThat oh I think the people who are experiencing with your experience and I don't take that away from him but I Believe that the eggs the zeroes into wars and the Jews to nine or sometime interfere with and we see what we see we feel we feel things move they move but this is my question\nMy questions in all the tragedy that don't happen on this planet and and that's not excluding things have happened right here in this country\nIf the protocol the goals would be because you have had tragedies\nOr or in your life that took away your life\nThen there would be more goes on this planet any will be people and just let's just deal with the United states itself I mean uh I Am part Cherokee and so I'm just saying the tragedy happened in them and all the other people Jews all over the world\nWhat is the protocol to be a goal and if you believe in their\n... if it's not the matrix\nOr could you ever consider this being the matrix and the numbers you just not calculating that these are the way it should be\nThat is my question thank you for your joined or music or their George I love all your new all the way from bluegrass too it's sold to everything from the years you've been plant your number one when it comes to that\nAll right my friend more to come so what what what is the definition Ron oh what a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nYou know it's the sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian\nEnvy honestly we really don't know exactly what goes this I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks and we had a cause a religious aspects of it\nAnd we come up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the the purgatory thing not like it's a punishment but rather\nIt's a place it's a temporal thing versus the and the thing so I mean that's just going on doing their time basically but that's I mean that's the only one theory there are many three shifts the tragedy thing is one I always heard about\nIn Gettysburg was always supposed to be the most part it then that's why it's the most thing but there are there are battles I mean Nagasaki and you I mean thousands of people will tell like that why are we seeing like almost goes from running around so there's got to be certain aspects of that we were unaware of or or have yet to\nDetermine and a ... and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly\nFor sure we have a

I'm UN ambassador in part because she was a governor of his state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the you know the Trump you\nKnow kind of foreign policy in line to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs investments for\nWell I mean not only was she with this administration she was with the Bush administration ... you know she started off internally with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of ...

absolutely hogwash\nThe likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean she completely back you know the Trump White house and with a ... wouldn't

that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private down there from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from silver plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform is it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um\nThere's going to be missed was going to be missed by millions of people you know this is the story that's going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very\nHappy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way that they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or\nHis book so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on but sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top of the currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical possibility but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're a theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that while that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why for protection\nAnd they cut us out on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but by the it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that\nTypically are the first place um and uh it would've been a lot better or out of the head in the meantime all of a food but he was a group of all these years are trying to find other places to go where experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of Google ...\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and and with the step to see what happens to compete with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably about a good idea and the first place\nThat the time at ... at the end at the\nTime that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have the norm of growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nUh one quick question I hear snapped jabs going broke where do you

because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also saying that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up

material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo would science back us up\nTo my book in the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine\nOr I talked about near death experiences [noise]\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just to hold his nation that happens when someone about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple\nUh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body out in the near death experience and they

this book did it surprise them\n[noise] and it's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell look as a cycle ... he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually\nShown seconds before the picture is ...\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test and it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people\nAnd the the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents met experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the materials paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years\nRunning these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators that these are machines that spit out zeroes and ones and it totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty present heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey\nI'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes\nAgain what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators more just went ballistic and and people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nOr set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround events that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant trait basically at at at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course and an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything

back marked over with us and we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates shows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here\n... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up to ... this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't even our eyes I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have\nTheir in cardiac arrest Everest acetate it and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for example Dr ... a ... party out from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest come back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body in verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the defendant later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when that April later went off and it made it very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia that division of perceptual study that the med school had looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping as one person in particular\nWe looked at these phenomenon and it's finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where\nCouldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not all of the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes in our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes ... a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally\nFrom the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us that are existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I still get a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you do in an incredible drama on this topic\nYou've learned a lot haven't you [laughter]\nI have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist and materialistic\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near

Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain of the truth that headaches going back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind and that's my first part my second part\nOf the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the minds it does seem to show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have\nWhether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we\nCan't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book I imagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire\nSo I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark of reincarnation well I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it\nWe we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the use the professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities\nThat are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical\nSomething else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another offensively\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and yeah I have a question for your gas sure how\nHigh thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise]\nI I tell a comment was set up actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week [noise] [noise]\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was a cyber multinational unit two thousand six and Iraq\nBy the way rank you for serving first night where\nYour case that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand if he remote viewing from a section of yes three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some buildings were able to find that three UAB\nThe person I Believe who was the remote viewer there was brought in a was Paul and I believe he was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get up who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that\nAgain I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality is more in tune\n...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planted a but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic it just isn't being researched widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be wiped\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their ... and the access water that's outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir I'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise]\nA lot of things that I that was a I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic who will believe if you find the proof [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nOh\nOn the radio on the

everything in the world can be defined by either it's density ports frequency or ... or maybe all of this thing is in thin film of organic life on earth which you know is is thinner than the skin of an orange on an orange\nA is some old you know the whole guy as a whole you know this is very complex very very huge being that exist sits on its own timescale our lifetime of Seventy eight years but\nBut what a brass of the earth which you know again if everything derived from consciousness that's\nThe same thing that Michael ... talks about Detroit with consciousness\nWilling to sound like you're open to the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work it might work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks\nOn doubting with water which in yes okay I've seen it work see at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that same to adapt and there it is ... and ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not\nThat that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er\nAnd I've seen it with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and ... over a map okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all [laughter] that somebody could could could find water and yet there it is up comes to water [laughter] so\nAre is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the electromagnetic flocks in the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting\nSemi conducting insulating properties\nWho knows he has a scientist we need to we in science\nCannot ignore this cannot ignore this going all the way back he your your guest mentioned William James okay all that whole\nPeriod when all of this a lot of this early early research started into shall we say ...\n... and other other sorts of things and I I I I've never seen the U.S I never see what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I Can't I Kevin put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole but that's record is at the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the\nRain comes out within within you know maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah\nThey can feel it it's it's they're reading something but to the to the to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin say the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the\nNeed to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things I've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\n[noise] mhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field of physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive there's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between gifted particles\nSo there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you

Wednesday there are competing\nAdvertisements representing an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president as an avid watcher of Fox News in particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening sometimes references little jobs from over at the Fox business channel\nAnd so the general public's notices and still have lobbyists and DC and\nLobbyist had found that in effective way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV programs so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild like ... like for example who's airing what\nDon't we took a look at the story now because there is a big fight that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are\nSavoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and groups and also oppose that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same program\nSays you know to be influenced by them\nWhat we can see is that he does English sometimes directly after an ad\nThat popped up on TALK on this happened when a group of a U.S steel workers with advertising during boxing fans in March you know as the ad came up the president started talking about the issue suggesting that he had seen the ad um\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember to last year billionaire Tom's dire who's constantly and fights with the president and have started an impeachment movement I'm kind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted fat and tweeted about it right away\nWe speak with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces gold interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong viewership um during this administration the viewership has raised and and and so have the ad rates and we've actually seen some lobbying from\nYou know and noticed that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president\nHas expressed a dislike for programs on on those two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about\nHim and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him well\nThat ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what the guy Kevin Mac from that group need to impeach how he feels so you just suspect that the president's watching and knows he can targeting what's with like a little elbow and the ribs kind of bad\n... exactly um and then also sort of interesting here is the president has been a very disparaging of Saturday Night live as a show that's not funny any longer and one that he says he doesn't watch but there's some evidence that he was watching and groups are\nAlso starting to put up ads during Saturday Night live as well\nAs Julie it's Wall Street journal
