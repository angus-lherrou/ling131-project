{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "But you know um that's like going to a foreign country and finding no buildings there just a couple of other people wandering around and he said hey did you just get off this plane\nUm and if they stay no we've been here forever and you say well where's your houses they said well uh I don't know I'm ... then you might suspect that they're they're pulling one on you and they also go\nTo the ... the same time you did\nBut you see what I'm saying so so this scientific argument against going to Mars is absurd and\n... and and this idea that we'll know more about Mars by not going is just crazy or because I mean what planet we know the most about\nWhat ever happened to the plan's your plans to tour for Mars and to try to develop an atmosphere\n[noise] well uh terra forming Mars is something that is is going to have to be done in the future it it it's not something that ah frankly our generation is going to do it\nAnd it could take what are you are a hundred years to complete\nNo it will take longer than that although I'm basically here's how it goes first we're in our time we can send human explores tomorrow we can set up the first base on Mars\nAnd I'm hoping to be alive when the first child was born on Mars okay that's what I'd like to see the first\nOh what a birth certificate that would be yeah there you go\nRight okay so the first child born on Mars that is when we're really they're okay but\nAfter that we're gonna have to grow on you know settlements towns cities on Mars create industry is on Mars\nOnce they're done which might be\nA hundred years from now [noise] um once you have a a strong industrial civilization on Mars they can actually address the question of trying to change the climate of Mars and change the environment\nBecause first thing you got to do with Mars is you want to warm up and we know how to warn planted some\nProven that right now on earth and if we wanted to do it on purpose we could do it a lot more effectively and uh the\nWay to do it is to reduce greenhouse gases um that is that tramp the sun's heat a they're a seal too of course is a greenhouse gas but we know how to make gases that are much more powerful greenhouse gases and see it on to\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use and refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just ...\nThe ... to the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now in fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warm to Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been ... and it would outcast and it would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt\nThey start to flow and this was much glee fresh water in those glaciers is there is in North America oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\n[noise] but yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would strike to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you could start spreading plants around now if\nWe were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breathe the all\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um\nSo I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about and who's going to do a thorough what country the Martians\nAre they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back\nA while most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the ... and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um hold\nOn Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this that will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on

with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now um\nIs about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven\nUh I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ... um\nThey can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again\nUm\nThere's a new paradigm now and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries have gone to uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if ... once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nMuch right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know I'm not a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was in the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that a ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to you know away launching a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or\nThe um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay\nI mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just be the rich they get to go to Mars well um [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and\nAlso I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go and um\nYou know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nOr they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air with only a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a ... you know the next new kid on the block who may uh\nYou know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone until you live do we really have the right to invade like America deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing um [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars\nThere are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little a futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to stay\nMining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because the mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the Knicks change for those claims that people could get a exploration missions finance mine asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nIn the sun right now or not um but um you know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight\nAnd they want to reflect most as much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that uh but space itself\nReally have a temperature but\nCertainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by

residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo psychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy got shot at a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a goes very psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually I actually got a job and then I studied psychology and goes party thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way\nNot very well\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when the Minneapolis for a year in the at that time it was just the booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports why\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brant\n[noise] well um you know I ah I have a degree\nIn psychology a when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied um basically the environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with a go study and you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounter\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away nation yup Asian over active imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nThe individuals who have these terrifying and counter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things OR Books with more than just go stories\nLocation outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes counters what does that faction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these encounters\nUm it ... the book comes up with concise and competing theory and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know I've been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of ghosts and counter\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and\nThat's when I came up with some of these new theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my I took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts\nAnd I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with a book\nWell then you bring a do some real science to the picture I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think\nSo too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a physicist a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so\nThere's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you continue to do what the ... experience might be a real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think\nA majority of the ghostly encounters that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening I'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes so that's um inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ... counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in\nBeing real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book go over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death or\nLife threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a\nAn aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know\nMy aunt passed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distress signal thing ah to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and in those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans mean you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWhere with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies is website haunted series dot com of course linked up at ... stadium dot com results on

mom\nSaw this woman dressed and futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else and a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared you to do\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm\nLive in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd um [noise]\nOh one morning\nA you know my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenalin and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratch and they get outside so\nI'm like yeah you know my scientific brains go and just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nAnd I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this so I open the door the\nDog and may went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I thought something like in the pond floating and I started walking and then I started running and it was a ... cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um\nYou know drowned in there by you know building upon you know all that stuff [laughter] but I Am for myself this is\nIt's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself\nWhat what happened what made that day different and with there's some sort of like distress signals that to me with the cat and distress and that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know but that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many pure noble experiences occur Brendan because the person who\nDied who comes back\nNever had some unfinished business and had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghost encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like a staff of a father or something\nRight you know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\n... the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of ... this\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are store to store it in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the things I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these\nUm bereavement operations associated with their debt spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge yeah yeah yeah and and perhaps these\nBereavement operations er visits from the thief shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased couldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards the revolution and ... ... and when I talk to this these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one step after these operations and I think on TV usually go\nNegative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes the encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like a brand\nNew what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys reparations then comes the others what's so special about that\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think\nYou know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em there's there's some cats out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnet sushi\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing I found out FM our eyes and eat jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can't you know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout\nAll rise as well so you you you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not

we talk about his worst scientific work the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work and if anything\nI'm you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes and are interested in love with the inside most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and they will not one don't think they do\nAnd I was really shocked that you know 'cause you're kind of sit back and kind of weight when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you know there's a there's still some colleagues who come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they you know follow it up with but you can't tell anyone or anything like that\nBut the response has been pretty positive I'm you know if it's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing\nFor human since the dawn of time you know does this go stuff um so you you know it's\nNot that bizarre or out of context of anything\nAnd listen I mean parents like college he is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline just like social psychology and neuro psychology\nIt's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university they are the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair of psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's\nYou know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled you show for brand you don't have the answers you wish you did\nA while I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nHold your guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says we're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to\nFathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bad light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child stating my accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image of my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked\nAbout earlier so we've all heard of these but\nIt it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional shifts related to the process of dying in a in a way set up\nHello Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation a those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they're linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but it also begs the question you know was this did this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with the ... well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be you know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're\nWe all think the electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well and\nThe animals she does show you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like\nSensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only Constand an all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a portrait guys are an eerie feeling temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always present as well\nSince since the first goes link counter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and go see encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that it goes to this president you know if a if EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking\nThe belief is obviously that that's it goes uh whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher [laughter]\nUm so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields very ... very entangled with goes way encounters even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up for I felt the room felt energized are like that\nCheck out the coast to coast trade five dining street dot com coast [noise]\nOff the coast to fight back to the doctor\nThe line\n[noise]\nFive times the most iconic

you to talk about bitcoin Kevin I was surprised when you called me and said you were also getting into crypto currency is what's going on\nWith George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currencies inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about between ... treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pieces with ten thousand\nBitcoins that were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and we stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWon those ... pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is good coins or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much has been going right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin you've our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black men IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nSo you can have aspirations of in places where there is no tragedy there's nothing like that there is no Spanish soldiers there is no civil war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus

there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you sure\nOkay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a following Renault but anyway uh my father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out the you know to put two kids\nAnd just before daylight you woke up my father was there\nBecame in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom set up you have your kids through and said honey everything's gonna be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and it was going\nTo share that with sweet mhm\nSo these sometimes these stories are just emotional as well they do\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it in in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um\nYou know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative ghost goes goes scary\nStories like that and realize it's going to join the Bronx I'm just going to George how\nGood a Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up are rich and I've seen um [noise]\nYou have the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal undo channel of communication going on between the go see a permission and\nThe recipient of the ghost experience um maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related this story before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by\nAnd he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you may be elaborate on what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or he was\nHe a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a ... a ... before you had the exposure and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nAll right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question one quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the the husband saying his wife and and the wife kind of says hey check behind the workbench and he finds the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is is happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation so you resonate with the consciousness of your brother and I and when you resonate with something\nInformation visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like there's one case in my book that I go over with a um a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd this feeling like a dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog in the water and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow I feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions\nAnd then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or whether you're reading a mind thing\nWhere do we get the book to grow studies sprinted\nStudies is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio and your car you can get it at audible as well so basically

farming and it just goes on and on of a industries that hire illegals including yes the president Donald Trump hires illegal\nTo really help with the maintenance of his property and in the construction trade\nSo the idea that this has now become like a great political football forum is the flows of immigrants are not going to stop and they reflect the failed states over there there's not going to be any reduction in foreign aid coming from Trump acting great ... a stump speech\nBut it's not going to happen Congress as the one that allocate the money and they're not going to cut the money to these governments because George what they know is that if you create more mass poverty over there\nYou're going to get even greater more immigrants\nComing to the United states but the fact is that we need these people essentially\nTo give the unskilled labor that nobody is willing to do because the industrial section in this country right now that they there's no way that they can

there's nothing in Washington that can stop it\nThere's no immigration reform package up by any kind of bipartisan package that's going to stop the flow of illegal immigration it's purely a function

O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in those glaciers as there is in North America\nOceans fall I bet\nWell\nPlanet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um\n[noise] but yes the waters on Mars that's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around now if\nWe were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out\nTo assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with what country\nThe Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back\nAlmost out of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy [noise]\nUm but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and ah because you know the Russian government is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um hold\nOn brother were at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or re email newsletter and today it goes to goes to um done um\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe bedside dining atheist dot com [laughter]\nOriginally third what's\nNew today on the free I her radio a radio\nLife deeply latest film tracks with labor it's like we've got the ... everyone's talking about\nThe ... getting serious and make sure you voted\nThe first ever higher radio broadcast towards your your support for your vote no long wars are gone by radio\nIf you're looking to visit a hall of fame and see the legends of a sport I\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower were spot in trouble before it happened when I was telling us to protect our home and family\nWhen you want a spot that burglar when he's facing your home or after easier as Sean who's blink camera alerted him a bird was trying to end spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nLink cameras or wire free set up and minutes and run onto doubling batteries last up to two years Bree in technology rake in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were\nThe police to help convict the crux\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double laid back\nColorado's news saw dependable accurate balanced\nFive Ninety Casey as J. get your children's miracle network hospital\nFive K.

I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power what's right\nOr you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know I'm not a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter\nThe modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about ... and all like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to get our way launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or\nThe um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons\nOkay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no\nI I don't think that I mean it's such a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just the uh the rich they get to go to Mars well um [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um\nYou know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go\nAnd um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing proposed and that can operate at those speeds\nUh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a ... you know the next new kid on the block who may uh\nYou know knocking on mosque office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit I'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high\nTemperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los

enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering when we get there if we find someone until you life do we really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right ah well here's the thing um [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars\nThere are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese blends the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow\nPeople to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because the mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for those claims and people could get a exploration missions finance\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's ... frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars\nWell then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I say is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with they go to the ... don't come up with\nSome other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the ... because if you go to them and fifty years ago we could go to them and now\nI can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber wears the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody had told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to them all but a couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these\nProbes are what you are or what would you\nBe dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the planet\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have gone away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with C. O. two increases\nAre in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship them to Mars what type of personal way looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it be hot and space if you're close to the sun\nUm\nIf you are far away from the sun it's called ... and if you're in earth orbit kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuit so why is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect\nMost as much as you can you\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't\nReally have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already going by fast food you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back well ah let them finish up ... questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would want to go into march we'll be back in a moment on coast to coast am\nFeeling lost not by your radio grab your smartphone or a computer and listen to I hard radio pick up the free I hard radio ... store or go to I hard radio dot com [noise]\nThe middle ... five Ninety yesterday not gone she goes to those am [noise]\nOff the coast to coast side to the doctor\nLine one coast to coast am\nNext Monday raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with aids list male Macs a patent pending formula within a greedy that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases muscles size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric\nOxide is a one eight zero one more civil to one\nTo talk to free from east of the Rockies call eight hundred feet do five wives zero three three\nFrom west of the Rockies to breathe go eight hundred six one eight eight to ... to reach George ...\nNamed George nine seven three one three sin Georgia Tech misogyny time of the money to Ninety six five to one from the gateway to the west ... him with George Nouri some incredible\nPrograms that you can see on the guy of course including our TV show beyond belief\nWhile you got to do is go to our website coast to coast they um dot com and elect says it all set up right at the bottom of the home page or there's a direct link go ahead and take a look at it plus as a free episode of beyond belief I Love you to watch so just go to the bottom of coast to coast am dot com and click the beyond belief dot com link you really will enjoy it\nStem cell technology doing amazing things these days I mean just absolutely amazing including making people look better\nStem cells have been proven to work literal miracles on the human body Dr Nathan Newman saw there was a huge untapped market for the use of the stem cell technology as a non prescription serum to be applied at home to those problem areas of the face and neck\nLike fine lines wrinkles and bags under the eyes his product is called looming out\nHere with living that we're not really trying to just moisturizer or cover the skin we're going down using the language that the cell used to talk to one another to get the cell to do our work for us to tell themselves\nNot to break in college and not to break down your lesson to build up to college and to build up the lesson to bring a new a blood vessels to take away the inflammation and that can only be done at a cellular level cutting edge cause medic surgery without the cutting\nLumina is not available in stores but it is available from healthy looking dot com\nFind genuine luminous products and especially the looming us there um with the highest concentration of Dr Neumann a P.

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had Cora live\nA who was a great rocket engineer\nSo as Germans technology that help the Soviets to\nWrite well they they captured some vie to split\nAs did we but I I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers\nSoviets captured a lot of the two rockets but they they mostly got the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the greed of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued or to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those critical time periods I mean the moon landings but Nick all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have ... you some incredible time several we\nYes but I I like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are\nTo be found in newspapers and not in museums yes\nAh you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man effort not last man\nFirst than hers you well\nMaybe they'll ask them no one\nHere [laughter] yeah well I think it's a pretty good movie by the way I just thought um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in the movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay okay\nThat this movie some people found it a bit slow because it was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and Gino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and this particular nature of of this thing and this this this\nAnd the daring of America at that time\nAnd um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem mass say David go ahead sir\nI didn't ask you both and thanks for taking my call George ... thing um okay so um it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already might sustain life what do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly stimulating an atmosphere where stimulating a licensed learning environment um I mean really holes that were trapped gases or you can be the atmosphere with him and we have or when he interviewed her plans\nFor that what\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to our gas out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that\nTransform it in the way that you are a suggesting because Mars was once a warming planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere and um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well [laughter] I\nMust I um I I Believe we should uh\nI Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting\nOver this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nTo appoint Arnie in Roseville, California go had already\nYeah high a night of the fish and I just have a question on your thoughts are you going to be leaning towards privatization but are you waiting or privatization on the colonization of them are of the Mars\nOr the planet I mean are you looking at just about to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you predict the government should do more on ... and ... how\nOpposition no real poverty as it was would you ever got the point where trouble with easy\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left OK well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of corporate so we can see which kind of government works the best\nBecause that's how we make progress on earth you know America wasn't noble experiment we could the value of democracy human rights people over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if ... if you have people go to bars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government of the Chinese they formed their own government don't go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be a good idea if something bad ideas and the ones that bad ideas\nThat are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will walk there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my
