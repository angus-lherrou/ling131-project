I've experienced is I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises become Dave great to have you back\nA George I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five pages that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into some of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities\nOr some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and\nThere's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and ah\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know have these people are really really good people the right to drag society these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find\nDown and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one are you missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search jeopardy or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh I've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement reports\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your\nEarlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but ah it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act

uh you've got some imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address not for a moment before we jump into the cases\nSo this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have been named David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds\nThey're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent\nAnd listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads the only site that has me is that can ... missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know\nIt's somebody of talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a lesson that can't happen to sing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right I'm a sucker for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and in a huge database and I would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there was a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years in a special agent there told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own or talk about that the nomination\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there\nThey obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important so you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track but that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated that\nProbably there's fifty a cases in their starts\nOff with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert of four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps a\nAnother two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old a three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last scene with these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search thirty\nMiles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child with such child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nWere they cross a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on well yeah I mean we\nTalked about a two year old boy that they guest he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was found face down in snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened in his his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nYou know the gays in the new book\nBut in Southern California the Lucerne belly bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance and you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for the twenty four hours to have to go watch six miles per hour\nA bunch of kids are going to war for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and walked up their\n... and the reason they have significant is that your report on a child who's a doctor to downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure somebody put them in the car girl from there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party and anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody Sony cars\nThere so how did that trial make a difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one\nThat happened in organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona ready to take a break now

decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles in all the report said that they\nStay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money\nShe loved the outdoors hyped regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she has a really good questions and was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nWhile in February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked\nIn s this Kenyan picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind did something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second notify park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that you sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they\nDetermined Carol was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents they did the Carol would never ever go off trail she was in al ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press it's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery\nMarch seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd\nAgain they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils and it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane a review of what it says one additional ... was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the hosts a J. O. S.\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of swore oh that's where our national monument and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of the body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than a vacation at the odor the\nFollowing day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the order was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never in thousands of reports\nSeen anything described in a national park service report of very weird and scary\nWhite guys that yeah\nIt's really strange is stealing they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is digging human flesh but there's no source for the older\n\nWell here's what it says other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary so I'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell\nIt I don't know if that could be weird and scary\nBut ah\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note or where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first sixty\nDays search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no\nThere's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon tell me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read

around a little bit to make sure we save some time to talk about the era cases so I Want to jump into one of the most babbling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McCabe and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis north side this is a cost her area of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue on\nSeptember sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California\nAnd it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable and he and his friend went to the ... early they laugh\nEarly on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and critically at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left a lengthy voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd a guy from uh Finland\nDid some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances in your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle\nAnd when I first got on to that I thought you know this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go to\nSam in national park yes\nI go that's quite a coincidence so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well\n[noise] and when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances\nSeems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh do you have any specific from the ... were you when you get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of ear disappearances in general\nThat was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from among the field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a I grew up not far from Moffett Field uh in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had planes flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week\nAnd it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day\nWell in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair was man by the tenant earners Cody twenty seven years old and Ensign Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the fur on islands [noise] and the Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minutes to the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to over to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWhat a plane's encountered cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they will bubble [noise] ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in a file and they couldn't explain why it was there [noise]\nAnd then in a weapon Fifteen for fun cause Moffett Field against they didn't get that in LA had crashed\nIn the hills of Daly city gaining city is just south of San Francisco on the coast or the navy response to Daly city and they find the airship on the ground with one bomb missing the\nGone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase and each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the ...\nThe radio was in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search started almost immediately that may be found to fishing boats and navy built in a coast guard shipped to solve the blimp dip\nAnd dropped to wears on the oil slick the blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd\nIs it all pure fairly normal but it did go into the crowd and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build you stream Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that we're in a craft were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a then there's the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're going to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nMind ... just log on to go to ...\n\n\n\n\nCensoring the stage at five Ninety cheesiest dot com\nIt's Monday October first what's new today on the free I her radio as high\nShow you a week we all the best ... gas stations all you want to at least a locked up in the play last night and you're on the radio resumes Asian my only experience\n\n... losing seasons even eat UT ability in the sun directly from the way you see your play last you laugh donkeys and when you ended on June ... main\nMainly I mean you can join unlimited numbers lately he sounds directly from ... medium size meal\nMusic when Leno\nAnd I'm reading Newman's miracle number knows more amazingly tremendous resources in an interview\nSmiling and laughing during the streak wind donations are leading you and me and supporting your children's hospital every kid has a chance to get\nYou'd you a children's miracle network Honolulu's\nNow when mine you know that many in color man in the winter games are really I'm Glad they're answering your money when you marry and then when ...\nMaybe ...

NAFTA packed\nAnd check out to those those to page five Ninety Days yes J. dot com or toasted toast am [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\nSo the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing at Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water\nThere were lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area because I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area\nAnd nothing immediately south of half moon bay so it's this one area that has the strings attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that we are laughable\nWell uh like uh maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you to to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jackets they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so all these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of in Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um\nNotice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nThe circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from this guy several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman books it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point at one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin walk Iran's that a program that have been created by\nThe Pentagon or to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin walk around and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions that didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with the larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wake up call I think so um [noise]\nYou know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to disappear if I could think my teeth into that could relate it to the activity there and\nYou know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water I have no\nPieces from there it's bizarre and isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation you control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort when that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water in a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there is anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the

to say I think that there's that the higher echelons are working with the parks that won't give you information they don't want you to know and my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about the uh the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the blue to\nTalk about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true it\nIt was before nine gene Ninety six I used to live in Rochester but\nI was living in California I drove across the country many times and went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try and find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman\nWho I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the people that I have been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name [noise]\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks and the boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up there was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them\nBut this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looks humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that the creature and those people that appear\nWere part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid says what I Believe [noise]\nWell that's quite a story or Dave any reaction to that\nKnow interesting\nYou know you do have some uh ask well thank you for

couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story my last book one right before the [noise] about

of the granted it opened up and swallow them and he said that he was inside the Boulder gifts committed for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that's the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories of Iceland that\nThey will move road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a bully in their society\nThat things are living inside of those boulders\nThey've a ...\nA missing for one one land air water is the latest book it's as rebutting as

I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff for a very long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spend some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nHow did you get past the road block how did you get that ATV back onto this road the two girls there's no way they could have lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses\nBut I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the plowed shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[noise] they kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they pulled off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake and like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact [noise] and you know I started thinking about it we'll wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto\nThe road that show [laughter] yoga loans how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um you know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but\nI tell you up in those woods there's been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big\nFoot researcher that the records their their sounds it was in those sim\nWoods where I heard this a ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound and I'd encourage you to find out\nWhat coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording\nTen or more years ago George ... used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years\nBut I heard that up in the shame woods it's a unique recording never heard of it before\nI'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big puts might be dimensional\nMight have a a extraterrestrial connection these humanoid that I saw in the woods the more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans\nAnd hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area and well we're glad to\nBecause uh you wouldn't have been able to call in

love ill so between um mount bachelor and three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watch the stars and hanging out you know like to play music stuff that's just kind of hang out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around for\nHours up there and we went down to look at it starts with an ... and I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kinda like hey what are you doing up here you know and and I've\nGot a second guessing but oil and really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that is\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche can personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me and I jumped in my car so bad and got out

up I don't get at least one or more messages from coast listeners asking me witness that missing for one one guy coming back Wednesday polite is going to be back on the air and I always tell them not soon enough\nGet more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nGeorge I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI Want to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations that I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books are insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities or some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise]\nThere's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise] I've\nPut in the book just recently probably because it's it's more of an evolution in my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because\nIt seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out one from help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh I've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many time families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching wind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but uh it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was\nBy a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances in their parks were they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any listen missing people in their parks in jurisdictions\nThey're loyal for protective\nAnd smart you are the smartest our pets might be they can advocate for themselves especially in the event of a natural disaster Hi I'm Shaun\nLow last year during Hurricane Harvey I saw the impact of

books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\nSo this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight that go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks\nThere all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent\nAnd listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads the only site that has me is that can ... missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know\nIt's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a lesson that can happen to sing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue parameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's\nData um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most time a lot of times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they can walk there on their own or talk about that\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work\nAnd talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there\nThey obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important so you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOn four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida was found twenty miles away through the swamps\nA another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old a three year old ... Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data because in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found\nNinety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last scene with these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere\nI'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it but as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child with such child's gonna do for the next hour they said well\nMaybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep and I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on well\nTalked about a two year old boy that they traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was from face down and know the next morning unbelievably or why we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened is that we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go watch six miles per hour\nOr by the kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and blocked him their\n... and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child has abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know sure probable somebody put them in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and when you talk about this happening when the\nPeople in the party didn't anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody saw any cars nobody else was there so how did that child make a difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one\nThat happened in organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona ready to take a break now

flake of the ball rolling on the weeklong FBI investigation and told CBS to sixty minutes\n\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] the navy did their investigation and they said that there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it dropped one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp lighter was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood there was a massive\nSearch off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch a lick that they were watching on the water\nThere were lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called the half moon bay in that area because I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area and nothing immediately south of half moon bay so it's this one area that have the strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for that to me that were laughable\nWell uh like uh maybe they got into an argument and ah and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ...\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft store and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be have been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak right because the the area of the water that was searched out there with search so\nThoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so all these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um\nI notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works uh in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere is also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened and he went to a base in\nAt the circumstances were it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them uh their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched down of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of the stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the\nPentagon or to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulls me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it any asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomenon at the ranch and I ask a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nThe idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone or he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so you know he he has a\nVery broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think it's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so um\n[noise] so you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to disappear as I could stick my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stayed at that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the was right in the middle of the ... reservation to use a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at the lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seeing there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that the the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot\nPeople are brown there and uh so uh ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now anyway\nIt's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to

there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I\nVery suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl\nAnd the shuttle can our kids play and the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks and the boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up there was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them\nBut this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature look humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that are pure\nWere part of the same group I

program on five id case yesterday and I urge radio station\nFar America's we're seeing this morning with Gordon these\nThere should be with us in the mid term elections approach America's electronic voting systems are more vulnerable than ever what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times Kim what kind of security do we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aids security though are really not in a much of a different shape than we weren't together sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aids by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's that ... just prior to that extent it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scan the Internet facing system to these where they um the servers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe age as we'll do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a patch of eligible\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and\nI'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch that system so they did that to a few states before um the to the other ... and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the Internet facing system not getting at the core back in ... they're supposedly not connected to the ... not getting at the voting machines at all it's not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching I'm order the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program the voting machines and they're all the youth tabulate the votes so these are actually the most critical system not the Internet they think this them\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence where are you saying there are there are some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our election system to be hacked 'cause at four glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat but um it's the ... the situation is not new\nI Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want letters to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the back end\nA states and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produced paper trail\nOn and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want to voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't those\nWho you point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nShow 'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots that did all those can be altered\nUm have mandated California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems\nAre the problem is is that um state the county election officials are looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of election security how do we get so vulnerable\nOh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nUh in that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad while you're um that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington DC decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballot that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount the manual recount and so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any paper at all\nAnd that's how we got we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cyber security journalist Nineteen Minutes after\nThe hour fortunately program is brought to buy for how you know not Martin begins

Brothers exposed how cavalier the world had been towards risk households\nHave bought homes they thought could never go down in price and banks had made loans they thought would never default and repackage them into securities to make them seem risk lists\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nGot to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who taught their homes would never decline in prices they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we as individuals have really try to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's an regulations\nOur attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts sort of crises [laughter] but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million homes\nAnd its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house I and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and\nYou can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and lower to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess those that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing\nAnd it's always the investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age in a sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do\nSure you have your ... bay those here and you're ... months there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nBut people one is to not start the next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new business is being formed is actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nUh we're speaking with Greg it chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or they're not related\nI think it helps explain why the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bowl mark markets climb a wall of worry that is to save everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate\nAnd fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects are less likely to you got to bust into recession\nNow that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market as well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances by about which the risk of start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risque but kinda like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill encounter the barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now\nSome of the risky types of loans that banks will make like to like heavily indebted companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you in some sense still have risk out there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\n... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow
