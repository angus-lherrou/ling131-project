edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing\nHow does that I\n[noise] well it started when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time at the bar on the back of a motorcycle\nAnd we got hit by a drunk driver through my body\nOff the motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my\nLab ... you know now I have to study legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house and my ... and being a good in Paris too which means you investigate everything\nWe do have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on it but I've heard\nTales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a\nKitchen table my God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids still and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drinking\nI drank it and that causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness\nSomebody once you around\nI guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there in left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town the alpha tell me where was that\nI was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to a Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and uh it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I have a lot in the style Jeff for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to parents and township where I had my motor motorcycle accident\nWhile ha you're born I really yeah well you\nTell me where cars you must remember this the the street\nOh I don't I doubt it was a big was it a busy street\nWith history but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over ...\nAnd I'm gonna

you are no I mean you've got a PHD in social was recalled you you've just been elected a vice president of the psychological shows usually ended up with this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which will remember\nOur new and more timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um\n[noise] well I discovered\nTo books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book called the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view I've kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out and then I read and I didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about\n... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at trance personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal cycle what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of\nNotion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr ... just like the beer right\nIt is and he really only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ...\nBrewery what she'll remember remember the Detroit lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe ... college which we're you know I don't know I have a really a double up minimum yeah I'm sure\nRight all the micro breweries have taken over\nWould wouldn't be you know what have you learned about near death experiences of all the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture\nTakes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment that the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste\nA then that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention you know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going\nForward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ...\n[laughter] every day more and more [laughter] I think there's\nJust so many mysteries and again\nYou think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nAnd uh it didn't work\nAnd Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing and they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio\nAnd his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he started to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests where the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker\nI think so too and I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick

it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important to live a good life and to be a good citizen\nUm to be loving unkind toward

controversial topic so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\nWe ... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift\nPeople's mind about that question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch blitz were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it plays in its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas Kunz book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world is is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shaped our experiences and so we can't see those things that live outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of it functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nAnd I think consciousness is\nSomething that has intelligence it is self correcting\nIt is reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery ... is filled with light and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like\nYou know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it\nDoesn't mean you've destroyed the conscious\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nIt keeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all of this\nI think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with the the uh the Android she's a robot\nAnd yeah I heard about her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me one or is a talk show host if she's in a good I

believe there's something there I think people have had experiences that\nGive them a sense of that I think that there are a lot of experiences that people report you know beyond the survival of consciousness or identity you know people ... reporting things like pre cognition knowledge of the future\nUh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location the whole remote viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that\nThe majority of our population in including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know began to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious than we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHog the younger people react to these things what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's certainly a lot of fascination with like you know horror movies I think you were talking about that at all last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see\nSo what's that about you know is that about just something that is idle curiosity or is it something that helps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWants to make some calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either Giovanni\nI Would go on your roof me when the war\nYeah and I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness is absolutely necessary your pioneer\nAnd I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this this birth more a wonder and and and and I'm sure you walk into this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mines that are just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forest or above the jungle it ended up being a form of consciousness or a of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are very very uh very rich culture of um of mysticism and and also a you know being able to travelling through you know in three dimensional and\nAnd uh and explored the potential of the mind through um through an ancient practices\nAnd so it's been instilled in me overtime or the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travels I was traveling from Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle called luck than on negative or roughly childhood or the the black a jungle and the this this black jungle is just is an illusion jungle with\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely explored still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered I'm\nA lord knows what's out there but uh when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and while I was meditating maybe an hour is my meditation I felt what I believed to be this pure consciousness myself the jungle\nCalling out you know it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit hammered a bit this beautiful because I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling me or or or trying to pull me into it\nSomehow and I wanted to share that causes and if I Do believe that there's more out there ... and the more we explore the more we'll find just like you said if we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it\nAs opposed to shrug it off and not believing something is there\nWhat do you think of them are\nI'm so grateful for that comment and the question I appreciate your supportive words and I think that one of the reasons that many traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is that\nA spiritual leader or you know domestic who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process uh because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms and experience that are unfamiliar\nThat are unchartered and that have the capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey work\nOr they can help calibrate that and you know keep you grounded in the experience\nBut it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von who uh is no longer in this plane of experience but she let this meditation where she took our identity into a bubble\nAnd the bubble left to the body and went off somewhere and I know that I got pretty lost in that moment and I thought\nIf I didn't have the kind of grounding that I had I could see how some people could be very frightened or destabilized by that\nAnd in fact there was a woman I'm Willoughby Britain who is a psychiatrist\nAnd it's really been looking at some of the difficulties surrounding meditation you know we think about it always as a really positive thing but it's also important to recognize that sometimes people can get into realms of experience\nThat they have no way to navigate and so I'm very grateful for your question and your comments and I keep exploring\nDo you have a

nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee it looked like a lose lose situation for Republicans abandon judge Kavanaugh and depressed the base ahead of the mid term elections or attack Dr Ford\nAnd reap the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle\nOver judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nAll even though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe his is accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors are Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nOr in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races were pretty close and Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters\nWho believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him partially and we believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so\nThat has at least for the time being\nA little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their desire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous polling that Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans on Republicans in a lot of cases seem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nMm All right so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on ...\nA big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Kavanaugh a Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her and the last two polls that have been conducted\nWe're now in the upper single digits in terms of his lead and the ...\nAverage is a you know that was a race it's been close it's been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunities that looks a little bit more solid but it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept out which you know whether that makes her more or less likely\nTo vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen\nA I think we've seen also ah the school has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill declared fairly early that she was going to vote against capital she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch huh Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still\nThere was a recent CNN poll that did have a three but in the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrowly it and this could be a race for influence but by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with the Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\nOh definitely I I you know it's always a a very political process so it's become much more so in recent years of each party has begun to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections were Democrats are already pretty energized because they just like President Trump\nIt's really cutting taxes that are at that happen again it's important to note that they had even looking at their chart here again very widely you know throughout the years and not just the average ... it's pretty exciting they say that can be hundreds if not declined and that year after my term says can forty sex or a park here which is pretty amazing\n[laughter] something by ... you know I I guess you got a factor in today's issues like World War on like what nine plus year run now with stocks right there's volatile politics as opposed to the you know maybe back then can even calculate that\nTotally no that's a good point I mean you have to kind of take that into account of course because this is not you're not necessarily saying you know stock markets can light on the quake and say oh you know ... acts that they get the same time you know the markets and getting really well we've had about tax reform and African grey earning because that is\nNow playing out of water and that's and that's this is all coming on top of that and [noise]\nAnd as we asked that question you know what if the market could I come to an end this could I'm sure this is actually\nKind of a quarter Alison Frank result midterms are a boon for stocks no matter who wins um as somebody pointed out to it in the story's been so

federal dollars that they tax reform and that's obviously come at the Trump Administration and that's been liberal guiding her for the corporate world and we've seen earning ... out here but\nAt the

nothing new offers new protections for us intellectual property along with data in digital assets\nIt slightly improved American access to the Canadian dairy market and new provisions on autos could protect some us manufacturing jobs but his trade experts scour the details of the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nThey wonder why so much effort produced so little change so says Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman Rick how to use it\nWell I mean so let's talk about what different um uh the uh there's a slight increase and ... percent of the a Canadian dairy market that us farmers will have access to or they're going to be some new rules on 'em\nUsing I'm a high cost labor in the production of cars if they want it passed between the three countries duty free without attacks so that might protect some of the American jobs but it's also going to raise the cost of cars and the one thing where I think Trump does deserve credit for improving upon the original NAFTA\nIs there now a new provisions that protect intellectual property and data and digital assets which really are not part of the original NAFTA which went into effect in Nineteen Ninety four\nWhich was before the Internet as we think of it today even existed so if the agreement has been updated just to take\nAccount of changes in technology so that's a good thing but guess what all of those changes would have been in Trans Pacific partnership deal which also would have included Canada and Mexico which Trump pulled the United states out of\nYour just a Trump hater and liked to pedal fake news isn't it [laughter]\nNo it's not true ah I run something called the ... report card you're at a finance or we're give Trump were accepting that Trump's former John the economy on a monthly basis we currently give him a B for his handling of the economy or that's pretty good um and what it would take to get up to an essay\nOr would probably be a better wage growth and better or exports which are to the six factors we look at but we give we are saying look trumpet for for getting over a stronger economy\nUh I I don't get into whether Trump deserves credit for that or not I usually say look the economy kind of does its own thing\nOf a truck but president either get credit or blame for it so\nYou know Trump Trump is doing okay on the economy um but some of the things she's doing you have to say what is it really worth all the controversy in the storm and drawn of oh we're gonna tear up the north American free trade agreement that might cause a recession apparently we're not we're just going to make some minor changes and call it a victory\nReceipt with Yahoo Finance columnist ... called Trump's strategy on trade re branding how much of this still might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different\n[noise] well I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution\nOr where he began earlier this year kind of like picking fights with everybody or he pick fights with Europe or he picks fights with everybody who in court steel and aluminum in the United states that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico\nSo as we progress through these developments it does seem that ... that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd\nAnd he's actually listening to trade experts who say look\nI'm we really don't have as much a trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else these are basically ally so why are you picking fights with our eyes\nUm when you read their help to put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement on a U.S MCA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nYears uh I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay I'm In ... first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries\nAnd that is not a given um if it turns out the Democrats take back control of the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be a very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections\nThat Trump are also a favors they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible we can be stuck with the old NAFTA for the indefinite future\nEarnings rex Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow us on
