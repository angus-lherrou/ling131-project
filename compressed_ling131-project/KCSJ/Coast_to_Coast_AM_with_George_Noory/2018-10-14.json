Institute in Virginia and William cells as a suicide therapist and he guide you\nDo these incredible states as hunch and I personally know that things just from my experience in love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good side\nHe'll tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such an eye out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own ah I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then this would be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first\nFully conscious out of body experience and it was it was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a\nBeliever but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your entire life a\nWhole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience with self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise\nUh that I\nThat I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you reach the arm out\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them sand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing\nMay um but they didn't I didn't\nCommunicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd are over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers\nYourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was or not only one non physical\nThe mansion but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know it's incredible it's our our world is and you know this incredible glue that we're in a given topic couldn't top tier I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information to the human being why\nWould the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human\nThere has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so\nWhen you you have these experiences and you know they're real because this really feels real you [laughter] you blame them because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an addict and mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no um when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] ... it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great it didn't Virginian only twenty four\nPeople can attend it's a world renowned as being\nThe center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nUm that was a that was one of those facts where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its functions and different names and different cultures\nBut nothing that I went to ... we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific wave at least a scientific as we can ... that\nGoes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in\nA very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience within all that I Want to find out a little bit more about what are the

spontaneous and people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations\nA fleet paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react uh I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you face that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as science hasn't told us that so uh but many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and there ... all over\nOr their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people aren't going to be travels the game to you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there was one in each or we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states\nConsciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're\nThey're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class\nAnd I talk about how to initiate\nObese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught\nAny more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the mind near\nA mind mirror it's just a device that um will it that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nThat that\nThat's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with their herself\nWith are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and

travel\nAnd he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at than than real Institute Virginia\nAnd he's come up with a common reporting phenomenon associated with these are the least amount of money if you could explain some of the score audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been\nStudying this practice you know for forty\nOr just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did\nA number of surveys and I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way\nAnd it's it was amazing how similar kinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance um [noise]\nA floating or um vibration high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming or\nForeign fountains as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nUh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent\nHearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your closed ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained\nIn the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things that uh for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is\nI find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that I see the ... on because then half each I'm tired I Will switch and I think his muscles and ... are you saying that\nNow the money you know I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found\nAnd what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body\nAnd when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nIlliterate look ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream again or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or is natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what\nThis multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the here and they get here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple\nExperiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and\nI was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master\nWe're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a Austin will get information given to us\nOr we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on ...\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this as one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated on their side money ain't anyone other than you know\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say\nEducational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and anything like that especially a religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nBigger and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe putting nominate but also\nThe average age is the first ... hearing things going on you know that people are recruiting recount cancer and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declined\nDuring early teenage years why do you get in the sense of forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ...

I mean has there ever been reporting a van and not a good experience similar to be is that you can't write\nLike there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ... in your fear\nBased if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a double\nA or a Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have like you made likely have a negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space and that's what people forget it and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you do see experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy if you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell your creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he'd written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got us in the recycling helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person you don't know anyone did I'm Brian ... owns a motorcycle\nAnd he was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything can happen it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because\nWe care to each other yeah and I don't know if that an added well out of body travel most likely mhm\nWell it could have banned but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus there's\nMany types of realities that exist in in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here we're used to linear time\nRight is to gravity we're used to\nAir you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's\nAlso in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is ... ... dot org you'll find out about all of this book and these courses in classes and in lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to talk about in Colorado and some of the great history forgotten town since Colorado Sylvie back I only see you're listening to and

because\nMy goal tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the ... out of it was lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really they pee owners is is that there's a sharing anyway come to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do our new constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's really unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience with her normal\nWell this is this I've been seeing go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say I'm\nAnd about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening and so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and ah unite the paranormal ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so\nThe two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name the spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community\nAnd by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened and I got particularly interested in this after I found out\nAbout a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to die of cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you you\nKnow I see it and I actually feel it\nI mean like humans to examples that well I can\nI Know this is going to sound really funny that I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn manatees Springs Colorado and he was hunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted that I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at that time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got uh laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen\nI Swear they because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband lives in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything and at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she\nI mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and your she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and ah if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts violet just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter] ... extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like\nLoans and said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture\nOr the house what what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd I'm an artist you know and it's very severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and he goes you know what steps do what you want he goes my mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes\nDon't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen\nAnything like that while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you jumping allowed blew\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost\nOf surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor for like he\nTotally turned it up so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I knew what he tells his friend do ya my step mom said go turn [laughter] and uh\nIt it's it's it's it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh it has to be validated yeah\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about story jelly so now you still live in ... springs right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell that's I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right\nYeah oh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies ...\nAnd I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak he he was fascinated with managing springs especially because we had some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter manages springs on the beautiful hiking trails that we had in my house is shaking my head and never find true north I kid you not\nThe the Indian American Native Americans knew about these sacred places and in these places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious but the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up and he um you can feel it um\nAnd the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas tests well actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as the bird uh we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction like their innate sense the ability to find their way true north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and\nIt was the he was saying he was the lady that may be because of these magnetic anomalies the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like ... pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am Lisa guardian listening to coast to coast am\n\nIn\n\nRelationship\nTo

the blue moon hunted history tours in Colorado\nSo Tiffany tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um I think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage to springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nAnd the ghost is gone it worked\nSo the manager confirmed that you\nKnow yes all of this worked out beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand sixteen\nBecause this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball in this book was reaching out that's currently trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast and the [laughter]\nYou I have made it is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals that likes other little girls that bounces the ball isn't she you I'm like no [laughter] leave in ... that listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nAbsolutely not if they are they're just kicking you being a trick to improve their it's here they are in\nPrison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil is dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but\nI find the best time to actually look for those if he wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself\nTo the shadows\nDoes that make sense yes the judge and make sure when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the police that you're living in now on to them to do much with non hunters salute lead the gas goes follow you right\nYes they do on like two words it's very funny it's the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know it'd be certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by a\nWell it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah 'cause it happened to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nIsn't any longer and the uh did you notice that would happen to other people too or just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah ... I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh\nYou're trying to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh I actually you know how to do it and like I don't really I'm Serious I was just wondering if it happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's\nThe essence of rain there oh yeah you know the family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a there is that [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even at the heart with S. infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see light\nLight up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth with the Rocky Mountain [laughter] very thick Atlantic very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine and you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the pikes peak they believe was the naval at the end I find that fascinating because maybe at some point\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know\nWhy is what we need to get into this this is very limited\nPikes peak it's very popular and it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it and um we're going to take a break in just a minute maybe you can tell us a little bit about it after the break okay\nNow the name of your book again is called ... that ... latest one you have four\nOr five five all came about after cancer was on my bucket list I've met they believe are an manifestation [laughter] and you find now and wine and it's wonderful and I'm so grateful for God thank you for asking\nThem in All right we're going to come back and find out about heat from you [laughter] All right my guess is definitely waters and we will be right back and ... and you're listening to the ... de\nDum\n\nDum dum\n\nOverboard what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nPerfect for decorating the house or just setting the theory mood [laughter]\nHome by the ... with labor is why why we've got the fog everyone's talking about like the famous people were bowlers Joe Rogan experienced all your favorite music all your favorite\nYou don't have to travel across the country we have one right here in Oklahoma\nCome visit the national wrestling hall of fame and museum in Stillwater, Oklahoma\nTo see the history of the world's\nSports memorabilia champions from all levels and honor east from ... chapters across the country\nMore information and W.

S. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um I ... I think it was called ... ... I think that's what the native you used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe\nI just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button at the universe that's pretty important\nWhy why didn't we called that connect it to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native at the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThere and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of I hate and cripple

I ... out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer\nBut I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your tire life a\nWhole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a Hitler therapist\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hypnotic therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into it\nHelping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your OB he will get you go what did you see I mean how do you know it is sad to see him\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you\nFocus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment was a little bit shocking\nI was a newbie I had no idea\nAbout the what I had first stepped into here and a ... over the decades\nAnd years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhat I began to experience was or not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense you up at ... at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is ... you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information ... why would the universe just create one type of human being in that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything no\nOf course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so\nWhen you you have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was clean because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an it again in chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really

what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have to

Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nMy gold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the pie that's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really say pee on an original is is that necessary anyway [laughter] I don't go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nCause so well you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado doing a guy as shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience with her normal\nWell I didn't think go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say [noise] um and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and unite the paranormal can even immunity and also there's some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a spin\nAnd she said professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirit out of Longmont, Colorado\nAnd so the two of us\nUh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community\nAnd by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go from the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened and I got particularly interested in this after I found out\nAbout a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGoes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to buy were cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life would go what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nLeaving seeing it you you\nKnow I see it and I actually feel it\nOn ... like humans examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things I'm\nI'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't project that into the future but\nWhat I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that um but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and\nSo I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this\nWe are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts violate just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it\nIt was really rundown\n[laughter] ... extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans\nAnd said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house with what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know it would just sold a few things and he goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSong about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like\nThat while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate sell Nineteen Ninety nine and it was\nEthic my goodness you jumping Malone blew\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with me on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nArizona State university first over a hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs a hundred percent on line you learn the same degree as you would on campus from wherever you are on your schedule\nPlus ask you one line except most transfer credits\nFor information school two three five one seven learned for yourself by the wall Street Journal ranks asked you stay in the nation for producing the best qualified graduates and white eighty seven percent at ASU grads I recruited within Ninety Days at graduation\nLearn to grow learned to succeed and learn to thrive at Arizona State university to learn more about ASU online degrees text school two three five five one seven\nThat's S.

Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were just talking about men or two springs and how has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're real in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um I\nThink another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manatees springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nShe'll be manager confirmed that there is\nNo longer with all of this worked out beautifully [laughter]\nNeeding now had she seen the operation of this not since\nThe book has come out it was amazing during the time before book yes\nOh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August\nEighth two thousand sixteen because this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nIn this book was reaching out that's currently trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nMad yes but you seem to be the you like the public is for these ghosts and [laughter] you I have made it is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you\nYou do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals but like

are they're just kicking you and your tricks to improve their it's here\nThey are in prison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil is dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but Tom or at three thirty in the morning but\nI find the best time to actually look for girls if he wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows\nDoes that make sense yes the judge it makes perfect when you see the shadows people\nAnd the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God like it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the police that you're living in now on to the gym ... non hunters salute lead the gas goes follow you\nRight yes they do on line two words it's very funny it's the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would\nOn when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing my show in the if you just look at the top of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah because I happen to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you know I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and yeah and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nI'm trying to say it's happening at well so they're like oh aren't you especially you know how to\nYou can get them I don't really I'm Serious I was just wondering if it happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and manage the springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's really after\nWriting there oh yeah you know the family hotel right there on a NATO summit very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a there's [noise]\nI heard pilots tell me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down on managing springs and bolder and even at the heart with S. infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up\nWith a red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountain [laughter] very sacred land it very very old and then\nWhy did they call it the spine anything right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the ... you know they believe was the naval at the end I find that fascinating because maybe it's\nYou know that's what

name is art I have a voter all at a cut away she asked me a twenty ... sold it to me with one thousand miles on it it was ah\nIn the garage a problem with a and it ended up being a far south as nine

... a A N e answer if a particular a\nProblem to strive for\nYour time I enjoy your show\nA chord of oil every hundred and fifty to two hundred miles seems like a lot\n... on the ground you know that's a that's a lot we can now that may be a head gasket or something else you're gonna have to find out where the leak is from first and see if you want to go on with any further repairs cause of it was a head gasket Lincoln and it was running out or ... covers yeah than those\nOther ... unusual on a big ... like that yeah it that you normally when you get that kind of oil consumption on a V. eight 'cause I'm assuming this to be a Fort Dodge GM chassis which is going to be there are three fifty or a or a three fifty one or or or you know or sixty four yeah there's just different things like that it could be an and they're going to be\nEating that oil not leaking it most likely but as far as the bell developed go if if it was if the leak was something separate and you could identify how to fix the leak\nThose older the engines it is not always a bad idea to to remove the heads and fix the fixed the valves at a machine shop and put that motor back to health again with this low mileage as you have on the bottom end yet\nStuck to Jim Jim you're on the end of the ... what can we do for ya\nRecently read an article about a company in England that has developed a new engine that gets rid of the time and changing timing belt felt springs in the valves are controlled by computer controlled electric motors\nAnd by doing it that way this company has been able to do die in a mom and her\nTesting this engine and the emissions are reduced by about twenty percent and they explained that the way they get the computer\nTo time the opening and closing of the valves is they place a sensor up some time on the Korean shaft and from reading that article it just really interesting it seems like just when you think\nA gas engine really cannot be improved very much somebody comes up with this new system to control the opening and closing all the valves and it just looked super cool I just hope that they can continue to develop this engine and get it into a vehicle\nSome day because it just a huge advancement in terms of using computers to make engines more efficient\nThey've already got some similar to that in America or in in our cars now they've taken the throttle body off the car completely\nAnd what they've done is they use the\nThey're using oil pressure to power the valve and then electronic solemn wide open and close it and they open the valve they open up more or less to control the Airflow so they open up more and it's like opening the throttle bodies open that less to cut it down those those are still using timing change\nThe one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that but these these cars that you're talking about they don't even have a throttle body on 'em any more they just have a whole like a diesel those in the intake with an air filter or a turbo chargers but there's no there's no blade in there to control the\nThe Airflow at all anymore which moves out the Airflow change everything just changes on them and it's like a a better mouse trap you never thought they could come up with a better one\nThen they came up with a piece of sticky tape but uh [laughter] you know these engines it is true they are coming up and we think that's as far as they can go advanced I'll bet there'll be something\nThe manufacturers are there are screaming and screaming would be a bit of exaggeration but they really want us to get higher octane fuels across the whole fleet and if they can do that there's there is guys limit type of things they can do\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call the came in after hours\nMy name is Glen I have a two thousand five square feet with the two point four cylinder engine annual five speed transmission the problems that we have is during the summer they were going on that next trip a\nDriving at about Seventy miles an hour\nAt for about three hours on the temperature seems to get above eighty five degrees the engine start cutting out like it's starving for gas we have replaced the thermostat um but I don't have any other answers or hopefully you have an idea that\nWhen we get those cars indoor shop that only ACT UP on certain days certain times certain temperature certain drives they can be very difficult to diagnose and some of them we just flat out turn away and say you less this thing does it when you bring it in so we can get in it and drive and check it\nWe're just not going to do it right now you're going to have to put up with it until it gets worse\nAnd in some cases they've already been to other shops and said well I spent a hundred two hundred bucks in another shop and they looked at it and they didn't find anything and and I got charged and it didn't get fixed so I feel a little better when I say I'd rather not touch it then and do it do you uh service than just walk\nAway an absence of any lights or any sort of an indication that you could find out that makes it very very difficult though Ross with your best advice I Know mine would be if you know that on a warm day on a heavy Dr ... it'll do it and it's not straining you that might be the time to call and say hey\nToday I Know I'm going to be driving out around the town is a good chance to happen if I stopped in this afternoon it's doing it can we you know ... and we were right\n'cause that's that's the time we're going to do it and I might tell a customer you know if you can do it and driving while it's doing it we got will have a minimum charge of X dollars we will drive and hook it up while it's occurring if it's not going to be occurring we're just not going to do it\nThe Volkswagen Beetle people's car which they've stopped making or they're stopping making what\nWhat was the last I Believe that was a announced Seventeen or Eighteen and I read this while I was gone no no this is all new here this is so old\nThat it's not even it's not even in your at least some not firing your ...\nTesla has proven how difficult it can be be to produce a car from scratch without infrastructure in place or decades of assembly line experience GM and Honda have both\nThey do so that's a ... and that's what everybody keeps saying is that Tesla is\nIs pushing the marketing an amazing way and there there was an article I I I caught the headline on when it got to be careful of headline teases now in days but uh the fact was that BMW is recognizing the pressure that you know is being put on their mid sized financed by the by the model three I'm ... and it it's it's real\nBut to the challenge for an upstart make or just like you said is that they can be innovative they can be pushing the boundaries\nBut they don't have that head start on actually having the facility to get built and if the other manufacturers decide you know it's our turn to jump in all of a sudden the game just changed and they have to be so established to withstand that\nAnd now everybody in the water and what I've learned about I loved living in a pool by myself but everybody else gets it gets a lot harder to swim the ... river might even be watching and seeing what was going on while I was there to test the store and talking to some people that were a little more knowledgeable than me which was everybody as there at the store\nThey're gearing up and they know that they're behind in production and they know they're a start up which when you look at Tesla or any car candidates I mean look there there quite a ways they ought to start now they were right but they were they were ... nobody I think it was they said it was\nTwo or three college kids that were coming up but it wasn't the one must that came up with Tesla it was these college guys and then it was taken taken over\nSo as an electric car but they started with nothing and the grew to where they are and they're ... imagine us guys if we decided we wanted to start up a bicycle company and compete was when ... no it's not going to happen so you start ... they've really made a mark\nBut one thing they did say they said no look\nOur plants are smaller and we're trying to do this right to get it the way we want but once we get there\nThey said their technology they have to build the cars once they get into capacity is far beyond what the manufacturers have their like\nGuys come on we can send a rocket to space and landed on a platform that's moving and the ocean as we can have a an entire plant that assembles cars with less than a third of the moving parts so they go together quicker\nHundred percent with robots can work twenty four hours round the clock and quickly they said if we ever hit that mark\nWe can do it and I think the other manufacturers are going to follow suit hopefully that'll bring her\nCar coastal if there are any a start up billionaires out there who want to buy a radio show yeah I mean not just put ... I mean if you would like to advertise on it but if you just want it and want us off [laughter] go shading plate right All right let's take a quick break you're listening to the end of the show\nWe recently sat down with Greg zip Adelie competition director for Stewart Haass racing\nAs of today they've won five of the first eleven races for the twenty teens season Greg talked about the importance of the relationship with which filters\nYeah here it's it's too hot we're fortunate to have a number of\nTechnical partners I mean obviously to perform at a level that that we need to do and what I mean by that is if we can align ourselves with um companies that can help us having Jenna performance then we're better than our competitors and and for many years ... has helped us design or\nAll kinds of filters are specially the air filters and do a phenomenal job allowing us to package the maximum\nAir filter size and our air boxes were always you know looking for that little bit extra edge um so we're always looking at you know different police in different cloth and things from that nature and and and they're always there to help us an answer all of our needs\nLearn more wicks filters dot com [noise] come\nOn battery can leave you stranded so get yours tested for free during superstar battery months at a lively auto parts lead a replacement purchase a superstar extreme or a super started planning on battery and get up to twenty five dollars and O'Reilly gift cards after a mailing rebate O'Reilly auto far better ... better prices everyday\nLimits of life the store for details of\nAuto parts\nBut they also make a great die cast car that he was a further anniversary that were given one way you guys love it it's a hoodie favorite make sure you like our Facebook page and join her who defend club and you could be you know and the growing\nEight six six five nine for for one five all\nThere is a a bit of conflicting information you know we we were talking about the Volkswagen Beetle and\nAnd I don't like needles I ran the bed bugs at one place oh did you go in we\nHave another studio that you could be in the ass you don't have\nTo be that close luck scratch like a dog and the rest of the show but uh\nThere's conflicting reports I'm On this\nWhether or not they're gonna stop the Beatles here in the United states oh they got their sales were down about three point two percent last year with but uh in Europe than they are going to be putting more concentration on their electrification efforts okay and they let through digital it may not be ... well they got the new id bugs that they're coming out with the\nYou ever had a sandwich from that place it's a great oh and they're they're great pains to the uh but anyway there ain't guys [laughter] All right so they're going to be a\nPut more effort into the id bugs in Europe and it may come to the demise of the United states by the ... yeah what is that it's kind of a universal platform car they're trying to make like OK okay I've got you know they used to be able to take your cars what was that thing you get when you're a ... I saw that you could get one chassis and\nSwitch a bunch of body or the store or the old oh I had a name and one of our ... is going to tell us just like we said what was the you know the ... we're talking about the yeah the ... it's like it's all on the verge of wanting to fix your oh what's that like the late eighties right\nYeah and it was like a it was like a component you can dress it up to different things but yes there used to be a ... a store in the mall of America you can do the same thing yeah not the famous you're talking about\nYou know this was the thing that we you know so who do hire ... ... the ... the I spoke to make sure it's the one from the eighties that you could change we got to figure out what that\nWas ... eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's go to Texas and talked to Hernandez Hernandez you're on the under the hood show what can we do for\nA yes or are you today [noise] fantastic [noise] yes I have a\nQuestion I have a thousand of a dodge got the five nine coming in it and thinking about a three hour trip and about halfway ah I'm On this trip up to get something to drink and a condition of the working perfectly and there's nothing wrong with it [noise]\nGet back in ... and a blog called anymore okay today later I just saw when I got there and I that I come back I didn't have air conditioner so our our uh my trip and I got a mother or a letter to the today\nAnd the batteries are completely dead now notice not compressor will now gone but or that it's always a a problem with that or is there something that connected to one of my battery a daughter that or\nI think they're connected you know we had a cold similar this on the hotline I'm at a previous show but I think this is where we this is the same problem that our friend vendor head\nWith their own with his uh palate truck why do you have to mention that because what I was thinking about a bad experience for him and for us what it was all morning experience oh expensive learning experience that was bought this had the this was exactly seniors seem\nThough the fact that you guys had to pay for this and he had to pay for it is going to help Hernandez 'cause you guys know\nAnd a friend of ours for forty years helped solve your problem it would be something for only about two grand no uh it it could be you know it was about to rent it could be the same problem although you might have something different but it is worth checking into because we're aware\nThat this could be things so there is a device here's a path to look at those a path to look at under the hood there's a thing called an F. C. M. a front control model you open the hood it's basically that fuse boxes on the driver's side fender\nUh [noise] they fail and when they failed that's what controls racy compressor everything's running through that and you can lose\nThe compressor but it can also kick in his you would shut it off the compressor wouldn't work\nBut the really would kick in now and then and engaged that compressor and run the batteries that overnight and then when you drive down the road the compressor would not break when he told to turn on it wouldn't turn to rely on and run the ac it and it just occurred like that overnight\nAnd the next day the batteries were dead and like what is going on and then we drove for a week no problem the batteries did not go dead but the compressor didn't work\nAnd then all of a sudden the compressor started working with the batteries went that every night it was stuck on all the time it turned out to be it was in that frontal control macho so how we diagnose it is we get the circuit diagrams and find out do I have any electricity\nVoltage coming out of that F. C. M. to POWER UP that compressor and if we don't but we have a signal coming into it which we can read from our scanner and physically with a meter oh we know we've got something going on in the macho and then with the vehicle off\nJust check this out when you turn your vehicle off and you know it's probably going to be dead the next day see if your AC compressors engaged if it's clicked on and engaged even though it doesn't work it might be turned on when the keys off\nAnd I think when I answered this call on a hotline called it was similar I think I brought up the power train control module instead of the front control module and federal that uh I wasn't there not being hands\nOn I just knew that there was a module that was the other thing on her way now like all of those up and it's a different mission is it different module okay so I was wrong her nails that I where are you listening to us in Texas where you are Texas oh we lost we bought our Texas I'm actually from Texas so I Know I Know where that is that we've got a lot of listeners\nVery [laughter] because it's a small gr up as like mine uh but it's a it's a beautiful die cast there's a lot of collectors out there they've really voice their opinion of how much they liked the car and they've also think you told us that they like which is filter so make sure you\nLike our Facebook page or go to under the hood show dot com go to our Facebook page joined or who the fan club and get in on that drawing who's our winter\nThis week's winner is\nGoing to do with being a sponsor of the NASCAR\nMonster energy series ... founded ... big changes next year could you would you believe me if I told you that they're gonna uncertain tracks changed the tape or on the intake of the of the cars reducing the horse power by two hundred horse power\nOn some of the big tracks next year or they leave that instead of restrict or ... ... they're they're changing the the paper on it since they have different horse power they're changing the spoiler they're going to really try to get the car back even further into the hands of the drivers okay I'm a big changes coming so we have to watch the next step here but\nYou know we should we should do to make NASCAR really interesting less at random once the cars are already to go on the track like an official goes through and changes the cars\nOn the thing on the end [laughter] change it's like okay we've got a random drawing we've got a random drivers which they all got to get a different ... in a different car we've got a wider restrict\nOr plates they could put alley usually get it in on it so they could just check out the car in their color scheme or winter the winter\nDrawn out of our ... fan club is Roger ... ... okay okay I'll bet you'll know who he is because I probably butchered that named Roger ... from the heart land Minnesota\nCongratulations Roger Portland Minnesota congratulations now let's talk to just adjust and you're on the Internet would show what can we do for ya\nOh thank you gentlemen for taking my call um this is basically a question and a cautionary tale I remember [laughter] I think last\nWeek about ah the idea of being careful when you started cars been sitting for a while so this is an idea of what can happen I have a Nineteen sixty five Mustang restarted with my dad probably starting Nineteen Ninety six I'm drove through high school\nOr that after the you know starting college you know it doesn't have power steering her power breaks look I was a safe\nVehicle to drive most of the time I only drove a once a week for maybe a ... or what's now once a year for a car show a this a few weeks ago I was planning on moving it needed to move it I'm Out of our outside shed to another area\nAnd so had the wife out there telling her here's a starting fluid and just try and do I remember my dad doing using starting foot up on the carburetor\nIt wasn't really starting I was kinda surprised about that is you start to write up\nI don't like the way to have it going [laughter] yeah [laughter] parents have to go after\nMitt crank I I started then it's kind of dying down by ... what the starter stop all the way and started again and just have like a clerk\nAnd then now that I'm trained over even the wife was saying yeah it sounds much more grinding now you can still hear like turning over but the sound is completely different got it and so like I'm trying to figure out now what do I do now I have met something up or what do I do how do I figure it out\nAbout this was going to be on the last six moment first of all I thought no wife wouldn't have gone I was waiting for a backfire array\nOf lots of starting fluid bathing and the greater yet I I ... got\nHealth insurance for the white regulate horribly classics insurance to cover the loss of the car a\nWhile so here's what I think happened as it was cranking you got to a backfire\nIn it and that put a huge load on that starter and either took some teeth off the flywheel or damage the starter and now when you crank it it's got the America Invents act on instead of the nice moves I don't know how to make a smooth starting zone but\nAll the writing stories you can hear because if you ... and somebody that is a\nGrinding and you stop and is is this different sound like that to me it sounds like it's still\nSomething is turning over like in the engine but it's almost like it's like something metal\nSitting inside of it I mean I could be wrong I mean I I was just it seems different\nThat would be hard to have happened but again I Would probably if you're concerned like that which it sounds like you are 'cause you called the national radio show um I Would remove the spark plugs\nAnd turn the engine over by hand by hand and see if you can feel anything and if you really concerned get aboard scope looking cylinders see what you're seeing 'em maybe she really juice it up with the starting fluid which would be amazing because you go\nYou could yeah you could have hydro locked it if she was just Portland or like crazy but usually that stuff would\nEvaporate evil that it's very common to damage starters on those you might even just pull the starter off and take a look at it because those soldiers are really easy to get off of those cars\nTake it off and look at the teeth and see I mean I damage is one of my Model T I had the spark advanced little too far on it when I was first putting it back together and it uh\nIt backfired and broke the broke the star on the fix that so it it's common we've had them in our shop where we tried to crank up one cars weren't starting in the back fired when we're trying to get him going and when they backfire else than the starter changes from one sound do differ did you have a backfire\n[noise] no no I was very surprised that it wasn't starting actually I mean normally are sorry for you know you put little but that in there it's going to start right up and I was turning it over quite a little bit of telling her you know don't just hold down the story ... sports a little bit of time\nAnd I was really surprised that had actually started up because just a week before it had started walled off for me to drive to the shed and so\nIt was you know is it ... you saw that you did already wide\nNothing happened is the engine modified or is it stock\nOr believe the internal their stock um of course has a different carburetor you know it's pretty up with some you ever bought shirt off covers things like that but the base engine self stock it believes\nThat enjoy a night that engine should be a free wheeling engine even if a valve got hung up it rusted shouldn't impact piston I'm that's what just makes me\nI guess I just start from scratch again and and your next step might be to just pull the spark plugs out and turn it over by hand and see if you feel anything and I wouldn't discount the starter thing yet\n'cause ah it's it's ... it's possible Justin hold on a second I Want to talk about it like you're not really there for a second if this were you Shannon or us and you had to pick your wife to either and you're expecting it just to start right up if you hit the started flowed right would you have your wife in the car trying to start it or would you have are under the hood with started foot\nWouldn't want to do I I have done this before and I usually have her inside cranking while I'm under the hood on an older car working the throttle and the same time so all she has to do is turn the key or I'll just get myself a screwdriver and hit the ... side\nNot a good idea I uh I Would have a crank okay\nYou'd have her in the house while you were under the hood with a screwdriver would\nKnow she'd come on crank ... oh yeah\nUm and I didn't I don't have I didn't know you know and it might turn into a why didn't you stop cranking that's I Know what I hear I hear you I imagine aided ending poorly no matter what but I'd rather have\nHer in their ... ruining it\nWouldn't be my father and and catch on fire so there was a little bit of an art to the spray you know it's a it's a ... and then he said you gotta give it up so [laughter] you know I was there a thought but ... but ah as to who would do what they are just in\nYou know there was the idea is I'm always afraid that you're getting a going by no it might not idle long enough for me to jump in switched places a person's\nHigher itself for speed transmissions all that and get this\nGoing the tires are holding air very well we've got to get this thing moving to a small little shed\nSo it's like as soon as this thing starts up throw that air cleaner on shoes it's pretty easy if you're on put the lid down the down a little bit I'm off to move it really quick that was my whole thought process and she doesn't drive stick shift at\nThe time I guess it makes total sense now that you're saying that way I thought Justin thanks very much for the call because what it would have gone in my case and well\nIt was what was already going why did you still get a phone neutral and blonde we'll or something I'm going to open this car sounds like it'd be for the classics for sure that'll do it

every day let's go right to the phones and talk to re in Montana ray you're on the under the hood show what can we do for ya\nOh thanks for taking the call you bet\nI'm working on MTV Seventy eight [noise] has a [noise] eighty six or a bird terrible\nOh oh yeah and in different anyway every line and get the turbo to work and taking it to a mechanic and\nHe can't figure it out I guess\nThe most on it works at least the gauge but there's not much of a boost\nIn the performance of the vehicle [noise] I'm just wondering [noise] from different things maybe possibly check [noise]\n... have have you driven in eighty six ... turbo coup that was operating properly\nBut I'd like to see the difference\nBecause much lighter of course in eighty six they had some ... to them but they really made a big jump into eighty seven men the following year because they went to a different injection system in a different computer set different turtle and everything I think in eighty seven cars eighty six\nThe gates would go up and they would just go but they didn't like take off like a rocket but the what had happened what\nHappening with this it's just\nA bit more ... it seemed like me on those early turtles and I also had a eighty one trans am terrible and they made a lot of noise and they had flashy lights but just didn't give a lot of power no it was kind of\nEighty seven what you accelerate and you could feel that turbo as it started the ... and it would really go I mean they were they were ...\nI think that's going to be a sneaky electric cars and eighty seven or eighty ... excellent condition\nSo what kind of do you have a boost gauge what are you reading for the U.S I on\nThe LA it goes up to about seven\nOr eight months if you've got that and it's actual is an electronic\nNation is seven to ten but I'm Wondering as far as a\nDifferent things that was the same motor they put basic seem set up in an eighty four eighty five Mustang is video with the two or three turbulent they're supposed to get I mean you should be able to feel I Can't remember the rating was but it seems to me it was like\nTwo hundred and fifty horsepower to Seventy two forty somewhere in there it was pretty ... which is by today's standards\nPretty low do you have a mechanical boosts gauge on here or is that electronic\nWell it's it's just looks like it's electronic it just is it the fact I've ages what can the\nGauge and it's just [noise] when you accelerate it registers it kinda pops into that seven to ten range from the other side of the gauge so I assume it [noise]\nSo let's so you've kept the gauges out of the Ford and put in there\nWell I bought it from a a friend in Montana and [noise] just trying to get it to where should perform better that's one of the other problem than I Am trying to workout is but it's got a\nFeisty but it has kind of electric connection to the transmission but then it's going to a GPA of course but um so that's not working out either so\nThat's an easy fix our friends have been able to tell me how to our friends the Dakota digital make a box or that you can convert and they\nSell a ton of them yeah so this box is a pretty small if you'd stacked about three decks of cards together it's about that size and on one side of it it's got a ground ... missions which wire that go through missions which\nAnd then it has to wires coming in from that electric speed censor or one way or depending on your system from your transmission that you've got 'em that Ford\nAnd then on the other side it's got your screw on cable that hooks to any kind of screw ... be you know what the old screw on cable screws on one end of the box and then the electric motor drives it\nAnd if the spin amateur wasn't accurate it's adjustable inside you can change the ratio deliberations with ... so you can get your speed just right on that one I Believe you just drive at like at fifty five push a button on it and it calibrate that for years so it keeps us phenomena are accurate\nAnd then you've got the best of both worlds you've got the electronic trends but you've got a spin on it or that runs\nDirectly I can use with\nYeah just go to Dakota digital dot com and you'll find their ... that stuff\nThanks very much for the call I was just reminded about Dakota digital the last time we hung out with them yeah twenty four teams emphysema show I was talking to one of the guys and I said hey you\nGuys have this that would be neat and he went oh that would be neat I said you can put it like right there on the you hit them a hot until he went let me think about that I Can't remember for the life of what it was now though\nOh they've come up with either I've looked at some of their new stuff I'm like wow you got GPS and the instrument clusters now and blue dinners and\nThat was my ... they might have been your million dollars over Tibet and\nThere's a lot of fancy stuff out there and here's the thing when you ... we had one of our partners on the shows Berkeley classics who was a a you know the leading provider of\nThat that was what I Would need I think to make that way because I Would I Would go oh I can switch anytime and I don't want to drive all the way over there to switch now they just said that\nThey are in in California where they did their pilots they had little demand\nA mini that signed up canceled after one or two months and they have no plans to discontinue the programs says but they're gonna have to alter a little bit mhm uh they've been surprised how few people are genuinely interested in the ... in this type of ownership Robert Parker Lincoln's director of marketing sales and service pulled automotive news in Lincoln ...\nIf you'd asked me a year ago I would've said this is the next big thing a lot of people are struggling and make the math work\nIt seems like for a while there and it it made me it's just in my selective memory of of a whole condensing a whole\nYear into a smaller amount of time or something but there was a while they were we were talking every week about subscriptions or this company is a driverless car this\nCompany's electric they just doesn't seem to be that is it because those are just started now and we're seeing what happens and it just seems like that stuff is all driverless stuff or did my Facebook algorithm change what noted that I had this\nI saw a drastic drop in the autonomous a ... type stuff which a lot of the electric were autonomous stuff that we are the kind of one hand in hand we saw big drop when the when the deaths occurred remember\nThe article and that was part of it I just I I think they would have I think a lot of it has to do with the political climate that's there's all kind of partner together all about the science that allow you as a political climate and\nAnd that just enrolled the narrative ... years ago was yeah I mean there's ... there's more of a push to say you know what let's get these auto manufactures a chance to develop something with the internal combustion engine let's you know let's look at the raw material differently and that in the news\nThe news changes so fast and we've got so much other garbage to be news stuff right now\nThe man who just who cares about you know I I Want to do a story on autonomous cars we don't have time we're just doing breaking news this half hour yeah [laughter] that's right and what's your feeling alive but if you're an eight six six five nine for for one five oh that's a number you can call twenty four hours a day\nI this is Joe and I listen in Redmond, Oregon I've got a two thousand three for three fifty six liter powers go\nLand on bond over forty five miles an hour and I'm just full throttle at a certain position just to hold the love just kinda falls on its face but as soon as I thought my vote on it\nTakes right off rounds real good wondering if you had any ideas on that\nIt could be a or there's tons of things that can do it but it's it sounds like you may I one of the first places we started looking at our shop would be at the fuel system in that because if you've got to an issue where it can't provide proper fuel delivery whether it's the actual fuel flow\nA problem with the fuel control like an injector or a masterful cents or something like that it can give you that lug at a real light throttle but then when you hammer down on it it dumps it in and it goes\nAnd feel flow is an important issue on any diesel and for a lot of folks that go into performance diesel that's one of the things they have to modify\nIs the fuel flowed out of fuel proper raider or different things to the fuel system to make sure that they always have\nA solid consistent non ... flow of fuel\nComing into the system and ah sometimes even a a crack in in a fuel filter housing or a can cause problems like this and it's a base issue that can have a result that might turn on some sort of a trouble light or things like that but it's it's more in the uh [noise] I guess the the the general running of the engine\nAnd when it gets underneath that extra pressure and needs to push that air through and bringing the fuel\nYou start reaching the end of that are real quick and you need to make sure that fuel flow is is proper that's that's\nWhere I Would start eight six six five nine for for one five oh\nI get the on from South Dakota I have a a one of one fifty five four and all that long day break that and they came to ... get going again one ship that if there is little even having trouble getting even look at it and\nWhat about you go about other uses bad change if you go about the cold grapes and the other two days but it's a little situation and what does that mean\nThat sounds super fun when you think you fix it and it happens again two days later no okra\nEverybody wants to think they fixed it right yeah absolutely they they were going yeah yeah they said oh what I did was great all I had to do is
