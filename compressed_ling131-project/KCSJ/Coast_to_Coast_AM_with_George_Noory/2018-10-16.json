either\nYes new Scotland do\nYeah the reason I bought the island these really free can be our first of all don't think that this is some kind of multimillion stole her eyes [laughter] tiny kind of a a little\nIsland off north ... which is very near Denver and the reason I bought the is the main reason but here it is when England played Scotland and I'm Talking about football now soccer\nSoccer soccer here yeah yeah England were\nAn CERN although there are better than Scott and they were concerned that they might lose to Scotland so what they do these they called me up they put me in a helicopter and I flew around ... huge stadium international stadium\nOf of the ... [noise] and um I could hardly see the players when\nThey the map started England played Scotland but I heard the match in my headphones and then suddenly I hear that Gary McAllister who was the the strike her you know the guy who strike who puts in goals most [noise]\nGet the penalty which means that's Ninety percent there would score Scotland would score a goal in from the helicopter believe it or not I move the ball away from his foot\nOff the ball down ice cream\nIn the helicopter one two three move and the bold moves away this has been documented by the BBC filmed and if you get on my Web site go to those those Eighteen most fascinating moments in ... in British history or football you'll see the ball moving away [noise]\nSo you can imagine the next day I received thousands and thousands of hate letters and emails from Scott\nHe helped corps yeah they wanted they wanted you on this one [laughter]\nYeah you know it's okay to inspire and motivate the team but you tuned to fear and move it all the way we the power of their mind these and no no it's actually illegal\nSo I had to give back something to do the Scottish people so I decided to buy a Scottish island which makes me kind of part Scottish\nRight here they have they welcomed with open arms again\nOh yes yes yes now this and this this island it's called ... island\nAnd it said to me it's very mysterious in any magic it's it's um it's first first of all I don't even know how to start but it it's the island is a like a volcanic out crop in the first in forth which is north of Denver\nAnd um it is of of scientific interest because why it was quite surprised and actually shocked that scope and sold me the island that I could buy the island because\nIt's a it mirrors not listen to this it mirrors the great

miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I'll always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the ... which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and it's a big bridge that I've cross this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to boring everything just like you do\nOn your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group or their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my and form a motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members that caught\nThat was probably about five of them they were just a little group [laughter] outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy\nFive while we're experimenting with San says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on\nThey weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group to the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things than they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that could help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from\nEverything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles of my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly and honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf other ... before you came on and he uses that he was in Israel in of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved up and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law items when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I have and when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely what he true\n[laughter] I Know where you're Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost that he couldn't find it and he was telling or you bought into and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it\nWas the tide class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing these are living there for that [laughter] just\nAmazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd then a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum and\nMy contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project a negative spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else\nIf he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we are apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nIs my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research the quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time as basically a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion\nOwner on Jupiter doesn't mean gravity in their gravity and an operative affected by math the minder the same way\nCircumstances are going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're we're we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nRich we're going to go back and talk more about your work\nThe miracle club [noise] next hour we'll take phone calls

coast five Ninety chase yesterday dot com anyone else to do so yeah\nMitchell explain what an affirmation is\nAn affirmation very simply is just announcing something that you want to select announcing a reality that you want to select\nAnd a great time to use an affirmation and just needs to be spoke it does not need to be spoken out loud agreed to him to use an affirmation is those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep\nAt night sleep researchers call that the hitting the gothic state it is a state of time when you can not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but but cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift asleep at night are prime time in essence Patel a path or extra sensory activity mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold affirmation in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night\nThat is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experience it's just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIt it seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals\nAnd I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the thing that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering\nYou've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these are things you want with\nAll your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that the method we can all do\nIt is easy isn't it once you get into it it\nIs easy the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency\nIs to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism\nThey become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times\nI never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I've wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this\nIs exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing we're kind of people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say\nAnybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member in the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club and anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take you to my website and my email\nEmail me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you can sign that you can folded laminated carry it in your wallet it's just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card a designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories it it is overwhelming\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes Greek tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role in\nThat again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable circumstance\nWhich will come back with calls next on coast to coast they\nFind out more about tonight just log on to ... am dot com\nSpace age five

behind writing down a goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demand that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that\nAbsolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every health health program with it something will work without it nothing happens now one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolute definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goal that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim\nYou have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this all on your own\nToll on my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental healing tradition of things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who are striving for all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our mind\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles throw that I've heard about was a financial miracle what I had a\nFriend in New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading a book George that I Know you are very deeply the magic of believe\nAnd yes and loved though\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happened to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know he didn't care I thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand dollars\n... ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend I truly felt like a miracle\nThat is a miracle it really is you know\nIt's ... with the experience and was quite recent\nThat when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on it and it does it\nAlso visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things give it twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\nA ... thing absolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all entered this wonderful drowsy but still conscious cognizant state just before we fall asleep at night\nAnd neck in image in your mind and that is seen as something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen and acted as if you're in it if you want to climb a ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder like climb climb you know really feel those rungs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple thing and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders\nAnd you always need to bring it back if you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you you've got a promotion at work\nIn time and time that will Congress ties into reality it may be in ways that you don't expect there may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it will occur stick with it your assumptions harden into fact eventually\nLet's go east of the Rockies to

final segment with Mitch Horwitz as we talked about his words the miracle club the books available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work much in what's even greater about all this it really does work\nUh so they ask you about that and also when you were mentioning the three hour meditation like I couldn't do that every day obviously but would you recommend trying that like once a week\nOh absolutely I think any stuff in the direction of meditation or any of the things that we're talking about you know any any step as positive payoffs you know these were people who were terminally ill\nAnd may have discontinued all conventional treatment and and this was kind of a a last resort and those who stuck with it you were tremendously driven meditating three hours a day even meditating twenty minutes a day is difficult because all of life conspire to take quiet away from us\nAnd what you were saying about fame is very interesting and the importance of maintaining balance\nMy experience has been that famous almost like alcohol and a certain sense it's descended bidding [laughter]\nIt could be very dangerous because people suddenly want to do things for you and stuff becomes available to you and as you were looting it's very very important to remain a grounded and you were saying you know a guy like Paul Newman you know worldwide famous movie store heat auto raised\nYou know he painted he he raised his kids he spent a lot of time at home he found ways to stay grounded and it's interesting you know when you give people a lot of money like the lottery or you give them fame sometimes are very unhappy because what happens is it serves as it is an editor and it kind of gives rise to all their\nDemons and and balance and remaining constructive is is vital\nAnd they can't handle it gambling\nThey can handle it they can handle it and you know it kinda brings out what was already there you know people who were generous sometimes to become more

miracle story with you sure\nHave been married for a little over Thirty years now and my husband's been in a jeep club for just as long\nAnd he goes off or owning once a month so he's a he's experienced driver on for years I used to say out loud to myself in my car and sometimes in my own head\nI guess you would call it a prayer that you never please don't ever take my husband found me a while and the thousand eleven he went on a jeep run for the day up in the mountains and he wrote a jeep three and a half times wow and it knocked him out he hit his head on the rough and it knocked him out and the passenger they landed on the\nPassenger side of the jeep and his passenger my husband was passed out so he was leaning over the passenger grabbed my husband's head and his shoulder and withholding him up because he was unconscious\nSo the rest of the club came and got him cut a seatbelt off stood him up he came to walk him from his jeep do another jeep put him in that deep and they went flying down a forest service wrote to meet chef it took him out of that jeep put him in shifts\nTruck that shift went further down the road got him into the ambulance\nTook him to the hospital he broke his neck in two places he has not paralyzed ... still alive wow\nThat is in every ... every doctor he saw flat out told him you have any idea how lucky you are\nIn love that story thanks for sharing that with us let's get Matt in Ohio when you're real fast ... go ahead\nGeorge ... hey man good morning I'm a I'm a truck driver and all that try out for a while and it's coming out with the

reporter at political has a look at the challenge from democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke James set this up\nCentrally after countries is trying to think that but then she'll campaign you know in the first couple of months to first Eighteen months really of\nA President Trump we are very different Senator Cruz and I'm always saw what he came to the Senate in ... he was working collaboratively with his colleagues he was working collaborative the White House he was working very hard to kind of play the inside game and get things done and so what we're seeing now is in the last six weeks there was some concern that Senator Cruz is facing a little bit of trouble from\n... you know the the massive democratic superstar Conan record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive and uh you know\nOne thing that Senator Cruz has not\nRelied on in the past but that he was able to rely on and and get help with\nWas the party establishment kind of coming in and and helping them out you know the vice president raising money\nOr the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down and campaign for him or so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the the quintessential outsider candidate gotta get some help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the race and and make it to you know give him an edge on that in Texas\nAnd how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nIs interesting what I think you'd probably see from Ted Cruz's supporters his hardcore supporters as they would argue that you know they're the conservatives firebrand but he always was a he still hasn't abandoned his values one of one of the person I talked to from Texas told me it's actually\nYou know Ted Cruz is changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate you'd see a collapse and his support uh and that's not really what's happening is that he's just relying on helping the more collaborative with a bomb thrower and that uh you know it's benefited him and I don't think he lost supporters has got it\nWhat is the uh as you said the pieces campaign wobble earlier this year uh what why is that what did what Mr O'Rourke do for his part is part of the Senate campaign\nBut I think the thing about that or is he a ton of money and out of the ... um you know he only crazy amounts of money he was holding these rallies that you know thousands of people were going to and and he he kind of sparked sort of a little bit of a movement um\nAnd she was on TV and currency without spending Ted Cruz on TV and not very surprising a Democrat could be out fending and outrage and at a Republican in Texas\nEspecially one is as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so it just a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement was real and packed and I think his campaign and not looking from Texas kicked into high gear\nTowards the end of summer and going into the fall kind of thing that they would face a challenge and and you know they've quit step it up and call in shows that that that group of leading pretty clearly he's not running away with it but he's got a healthy pretty safely\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to take it and they get they were in charge over at any rate thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter wow that is just an absolute record\nFor speaking with James ... Senate campaign reporter for political who's written a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz sanded down some of the sharp edges on his personality by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act high profile Republican tide turkey on the attack and you remember famously occurs shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got to the Senate you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really use it in sort of an outside\nPressure force on Republican inside the Capitol to force their hand and he did exactly wash their hands to the chagrin of his colleagues and and folks in the capital and to the the new time around in twenty Seventeen he was a meeting with Republican senator he's working very closely with his colleague he wasn't there\nAnd bombed that fatty you try to get a and you know they were unsuccessful but they were unsuccessful you know not because of the Senator Cruz because it involves a bomb the way that ah yeah he had previously and\nYou quoted a Republican consultant in your story who said something to the effect of that a federal federal Rourke had become like Ted Cruz of this election almost like he was taking a page from cruises playbook\nYeah in a sense it's it's funny you know you get some pushback from Republicans and your credit that are working outside or because he's been in politics are more than a decade in and out of the house I'm honored and but he's he's running this kind of campaign against you know the establishment again politics as usual against the way things are usually done in Washington\nAnd so he he's trying to go on to the sort of anti Taliban anti politics as usual maple\nTrees and famous for and contrast that to a Democrat in fact this is very hard to run\nNext James James Oregon Senate campaigns reporter at Politico twenty minutes now in front of the hour fund this morning Americas first news", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "16"}
