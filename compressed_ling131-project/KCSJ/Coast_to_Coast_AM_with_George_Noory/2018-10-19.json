I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving the reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first\nTest the legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe retailer on you days ago I heard it a great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I says I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you do this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically magician I Can't see the trick\nOr were you do switch or anything like that I've looked at videos I've slowed them down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic tricks as many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there\nAs a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately and then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down frames and did you learn anything from that\nWell I you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and clocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] try to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic trick or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was a kid I mean I wasn't ... I was a really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I mean now I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed with the trick I was visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThen there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking so restrictive limiting it to higher consciousness go into fourth dimension and be on\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and other financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be growing in a consciousness or the kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah indeed now George Will we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers our listeners your birth month in days\nTo have a birthday and a first name possible short they're asking about I'm a fellow man a lot about love and [laughter]\nOkay and try to keep each call to about a minute nap or show if you can't talk to him about his desire to have so many people\nWere cut it short will try to get right in there as quickly as we\nDo you believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have if we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension is I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other a\nLot of I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation and say yes a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious orders\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhen you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nWell I don't like going to the cemetery I I don't like the energy there and people who are ... and they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process\nIs really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that great\nBut you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person and good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about that we can we don't well if they're going to like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had to go there and let them go I'm going to the cemetery very bad or you know my my parents were big cemetery ... hours as I was growing up is that a good word goer [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of the generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and I found myself a cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point my parents were pointing to a muscle am driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom that she I think we should get one of those\nOh and I think they were well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here they'll play no they're not going to stay here back\nTo this day I was I started crying and they said what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nYou know I thought

more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely afraid to call in I'm very happy to have\nA ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from its ally for us we get it from God at the moment we take a fresh breath until we take out last breath so the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals

intuitive so you can feel presses or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you're with the person who is not that good it would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary [noise] so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates or the ... day in year and then if they want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be craving however you run a judge I think that\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris ... been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen

paint you shouldn't be painting again that's very therapeutic the press and that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well\nSo you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough ... so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it if you have a question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\nThank Thanks Chris Russia last year and there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know I sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say that to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard

the other side it's fabulous you agree by people you know it's a big party and those of us who left here are grieving somewhere probably you know feeling really bad about it\nBut it's a joyful for them and if you watch the movie defending your life one of my favorite movies I don't know if you've seen that George\nThey really don't care Meryl Streep is in it and it's terrific she says oh my five children\nShe passed away and she\nWas on the other side's she had five children that she left here and she said oh there'll be fine and\nNow sometimes you know little lie that make somebody feel good choices\nThat okay we've all done it [laughter] I mean like like do you see somebody at a party and go do you look great and maybe they do but at least you're doing it to make them feel

understanding that there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about is you try to talk it out that the\nMedication you're hallucinating or something but this person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense with an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition\nThat oh yeah we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirit and then we come back and sometimes with the same and sometimes when nuts\nSo the gift of the experiences with shrinks Michael dissociation was the buildup either travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are except\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not lonely little boy you

learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day that you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up\nYounger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe are time travel is in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it one of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk\nTo a wider self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled the parallel worlds for example\nBut will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as at some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it for now dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survive physical death is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my ... glued but loving family members are ancestors of spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the\nCondom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we all said travel into the past from this my mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in\nThe multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experiences papa dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use their story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest cells so we might be liking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a better and more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream\nYou've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing and probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that I began to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive you know I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding often to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple for step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it let ourselves the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch a good time to back on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nWhat about the ability to chime travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know it or not they do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away so that is that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable I mean this is very important dreams show us\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead their husbands the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life that can save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know for certain show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates with death ... accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast what was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file a blind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but\nTime doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact\nYou understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of many a time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times when you're leading a power life this become very interesting when you begin to look at gifts of lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and that that other parallel life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost that time of the guy to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in far flung places to a part of your multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience but we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in times of the ...

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name and there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to him he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat him to sudden close to a certain place might even be an agent of simplicity but\nAs I'm telling it it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the the these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the the attitude of the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking for waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason everything in life\nThe polls and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting belief and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain to dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter any reading the ... mind to match up into leave at every tuning every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that very exploring we have to remember the body has its own messages his discoveries that the phenomena\nBut used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot and maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body the body sometimes seems to know things that are going to happen before the\nThe mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body\nReacts to something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time\nMy blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is bode again it's not at all when\nYou lived in pants and after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland beat the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the before it took place and the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific proof\nOf a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment onto the patriots symptoms because but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing we know what the bleep we don't know that\nWe know enough about it you know so\nMedic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and\nWe feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell acted dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of lose the dreaming you'd call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of ... will do this in treatment venture\nIs to start out lose to the state loose it what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance and adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream you another example is and I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that drift the tri state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive agreement with the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at the ... the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and self misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of health of healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that behind something that's scaring worrying you and\nYour dream is a power power the understanding of power that might might give you all kinds of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the ... but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're

young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's in situations Joe in his dream life\nOh yes he was young young was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflections that he has interesting Philips every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is a man I mean a titan of scholarship in science who is driven all his life by his dream a lot of the stories in my new book mysterious realities involves humans passage into the afterlife and actually while he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of that is in the previous documentation is that human dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on legs Oric\nWas called bowling get up to the nearby village is living in another bowling on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all fear of death you felt absolutely confident in certain he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious around his Coby out of the ball and gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation on actually gives some insight into where how humans mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books or in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised that Robert his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from\nThe other side of death but you know you'll himself wrote a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped his view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this that gives the first time the ability to understand what happens to mind of consciousness off to death because it dreams as you understood we receive visitations from the prompted didn't dreams who made travel\nInto the rooms where they are at home but very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continuous lives and other realities that we perceive and dreams so I'll dreams maybe memories\nOf ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a Sherman is negotiated through a deep and horrifying experience\nOf an under will journey and he paid the price of surviving that and coming back and adding his science and his scholarship to what he knew firsthand about deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding of all the things we're talking about so many great admirer of you\nWho wasn't young close would Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had disputes\nFreud regarded as his air ... young was humorous Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own rights who made himself is number one case study\nWhich is what you need to do to listen to to anything on dreams when someone who's not a dream of despite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on and dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to plant to human streams\nAnd you had famously a dream in which he's in a house that has on many levels\nAnd the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is a a floor and bones and skills and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to your own as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead ...\nAnd Yom didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into a cup of narrow understanding\nAnd that breakup was very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversations with human foie gras approaching that pops up there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stop so scared and confused and\nAnd and and you wrote in describing this he felt something ... and his belly like a hot sun is and he was going to happen again there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing a pot so what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the form the phenomena synchronous city which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us\nSo it's a very interesting thing in my story about you'll you'll says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion he's a vote on a long way since he died but that doesn't have much contact together\nNow I Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imaginable realm\nBut imagine round is a space between time I did too that the weather of palaces in schools and universities and pleasure pox that are designed by human imagination in concert with intelligence is from a higher level I borrowed the word for word from from the writings of\nSome medieval sue the mistakes who spent a lot of time traveling in these regions\nWhat what the national realm is about is the idea that the imagination of the human imagination assisted by greater imagination perhaps make real worlds beyond the physical playing these reel to reel will of course\nInclude desirable afterlife locations they also include places a study education and the negotiation and you know what you can find out about these things by going that as the story is to just let them offering as a puff of direct experience not just can be done theories\nA loss of a second hand to count I'm offering ways of knowing for yourself whether you have available to you for example

voters\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the that you feel very strange about\nWhen you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nWell I don't like going to cemeteries I don't like the energy there and people who are ... and they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process\nIs really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief but you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about that we can wish them well if I go on for like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go are going to the cemetery is very bad ah you know my my parents were big cemetery powers as when I was growing up is that a good work ... hours [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and uh I found myself a cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point in my parents were pointing to a muscle am as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of\nThose oh and I think they were wealthy at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here they'll play no they're not going to stay here back\nAs a as I started crying and they said what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nYou know I thought it was like a house huh\nI thought they were going to those crazy people live in a fight with my dog and my bike\nI Love it there are a joy stay with us we'll come back and we'll take phone calls

stressed I probably will not say them the best way to learn to say ours is just look beyond the person or in a dimly lit room you'll see something and then over a period of time it will increase but are as a very very important\nAnd uh understanding what they mean is the colors and the\nShape are all very very important Georgia so I came to the earth you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the Casey story where he was getting on an elevator he could see ... and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any ... scared and they haven't caught about how she didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamp and the people died\nYeah you gotta love case the my bag so absolutely George reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call the power where'd you get it from\nI don't think his power I oh God that ... where it really is the trafficking yeah a lot of people say that and I think only God has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely afraid to call in I'm very happy to have\nA ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from its ally for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath so the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to this show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me that night and he said you know mom I'm fine I don't want\nYou to worry about me and when I lost my dog he came to me and the little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's a crazy they called me mom they really think that mother\nSo animals and that's your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go but they do\nHave a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nUh I I don't want people to think that two sides that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go and\nYou know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicide\n... birds said\nYes don't do it [laughter] I\nKnow you asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have done ... to ...\n... is feeling the threat class that had you a sense and you're feeling that very intuitive so you can feel it presses or like when you're with and there are field is that what you mean Joyce\nYes oh I'll bet ya impressive\nSo if you're with the press and who's not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche or\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the word Jewish I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energy which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of healing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates or the ... day in year and then if they want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great how you're on a judge I think that the one\nThat started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris has ah been born on

an aggressive final stretch of campaigning in an attempt to help more than two dozen vulnerable Republicans and save the house before he retires USA Today congressional reporter Eliza ... got the scoop it was what do we know\nHe's had a really aggressive final sprint he's like he's going to twelve states he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbents who currently serve with him a handful are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidates specifically like the person trying to take his seat because he's retiring\nWould you keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always have a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read lots and lots of money for the party he's raised there were seven eight million dollars\nFor the party with a lot of that going to keep these candidates\nSafer attempt to keep these candidates saint Pete certainly doesn't need it he's not running again and keep an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of just basically like a ... a day a multiple districts and\nJust go kind of on his final sprint that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help is like to see if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves\nLike jeez are so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members and as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his side\nYeah I thought this is really interesting as well I've spent the last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and from there and it has said that sort of trick conservative far rate\nMembers of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually sunk legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen votes in order\nTo pass anything and they can do right now on their\nOwn um but they need by in front of the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they sort of voting bloc and they've done that and they've threatened to do that and so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases\nSo I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat who is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus is not just a rank and file member but he's widely people making these decisions on what they'll think and what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races\nSo to speak with allies Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is it in the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates that what kind of messaging well he does or does it change from Canada to candidate\nSo it will change from candidate a candidate what he'll do will change from Canada to Canada in some places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off Republican leadership I'm at the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely um groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package that was signed into law under President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on these tiny little bells all grouped together a lot of vulnerable Republicans have their names on those bills\nCampaigning on all of that but the message basically being\nYou're better off at a Republican leadership and Democrats\nThey say are going further and further can\nAh how will he use President Trump is at all\nBut I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist you said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our money elsewhere rent payments that none of them are counted out but\nThese districts where the Democrat\nIs making a big strong place it's probably not\nJust tricks to align yourself really closely with the president in last year doing an event with just the Republican faith but right sort of more of a moderating force the obviously the vice presidential candidate with Mitt Romney and\nSo he comes in he doesn't elicit really strong feelings from either side of people might not like his agenda that he's not as controversial because President Trump so it seems that they're hoping he'll go in and kind of be able to soften the Republican Party image and actually stay on message about the economy and that sort of thing\nA lot of allies are calling USA Today congressional reporter twenty minutes in front of the hour on this morning
