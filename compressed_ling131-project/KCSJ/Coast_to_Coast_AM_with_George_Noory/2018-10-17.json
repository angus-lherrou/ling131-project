{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "Well that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role well\nHe he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write in your collection of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nOr is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... reintroduced to uh you know a whole New Orleans in this way\nNicolas wasn't rod surely one of the co writers a planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a so called credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of you know\nExcept for ... and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery or twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the alien had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials that's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed route certainly could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy to westerns to comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype or you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that with a big theme is or was this idea of going back to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still now to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know that's\nThat's ever [laughter] and they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and starve to ever flown who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nAll right Nick stay with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas per ISI about some of the older type television

rod surely in were alive today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults\nTelevision has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time that rod Serling was riding obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the just the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of junk too but um but I think in\nGeneral he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time\nA rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life uh this is your life with\nA show where they bring somebody onto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult\nTo get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be good it's kind of like talking about a major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know and you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that\nYou know I'd be in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation or seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer and the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was ordering\nFrom Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots okay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is\nThat you know of course the production level of in terms of budget you know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to\nWork with a you know more a relatively modest a set and the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know there is one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert Redford start yeah yeah has learned Redford actually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first ah parents by Robert Robert Redford on television\nA and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the\nYou know spill person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what does what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that was a terrifically are both on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode was finally or at least ... years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas dealer\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to the half hour I'll rarely yeah okay yeah and miniature was one of the hour long episode and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that uh\nThe series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years or in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set a it was yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation\nOn an Island New York is with us they just going to make a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seemed like\nIt was very escapist\nWell then maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really liked that my second question would be about\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes how the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out of limits came afterwards but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma and we're taking away\nThe shade of Georgia and neck you know Ron sterling man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd everything he had been through one of my favorite episodes is hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming home from Italy crashes in the desert\nThe cat that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and Bob coming it's just having me walking by seeing this newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd ah he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd relive the experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd Simon psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock\nOf seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it the nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time toward and twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... day and\nThey had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy you know way back in time three different times and he thought he would try to after events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed\nYou know at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany they're already thought he could alter that event\nOf course\nBut a man I don't know it'd be hard to say which be my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all\nTimes the guy was all a shrine\nHand when he got a break from the department store you went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts this did it uh you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy who ran the department store they found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes and goes where did you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these ... and he goes no I just I found the bag and the give strength and I'm just giving them out\nTo the police station and the department store owner came in there and so yeah there it is there is the merchandise call well you're the ... by you know\nAnd uh the guy's name was Mr done department store owner right and and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty cans in Iraq\nAnd so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out of that bag so just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raised in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three\nAnd handed it to Mr gundy [noise] you know said merry Christmas and both of them got pre pre toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a sleigh with reindeer and arrows beside him and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI Love it does you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in this well its own feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of time your neck but uh I've got to tell you this is a topic that has sued dear to my heart it brings back memories when I was a kid watching television my folks were there in the room with those those are great time sort of thing\nAnd it's great memories yeah yeah it's it was a different time and you know for all of us and uh yeah it's great to ... TV can bring you back that way uh you know so it's yeah it's great to think about\nLife was different too sure it sure was yeah yeah absolutely it was a kid I didn't have a cure in the world we\nKnow and that's where the you know that that's something that a rod Serling was was yearning for in a lot of us well isn't that supposed to be able to go back to being a kid and have nothing to being carefree and being innocent and and the less stress and everything else and that came out and in so many stories\nBy the way you believe it was wrong about one thing you're not a bad bad man\n[laughter] that's what I can tell you different from bill movies you can call me that after\nThe glass again neck one more time about your website if you would for people\nSure will be a rod Serling memorial foundation or can be found just that rod Serling dot com WWW dot ... dot com and uh I have a Facebook page that's dedicated to the book so it's not my personal pages it's for the book it's Facebook dot com and then as forward slash rod\nSerling dimensions open were rod Serling dimensions ah the working title for the book was dimensions of imagination so it was that but a book is called rod Serling his life working imagination\nSuper neck thanks again up next we're talking about haunted collectibles in collectibles to [noise]\n...

bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally your head like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie card to punish them\nI ran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with you know you're better off having 'em\nSign a napkin yeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right here everybody's\nOn the baseball card that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nPlaying football ... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called a big plate he had a home plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze banish

pretty much from Nineteen fifty five onward I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly dictated most of his scripts and\nAnd honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little

C. S. T. dot com or coast to coast\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George nobody with you with ... with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role well\nHe he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery it was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring\nAll the ... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted\nObviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode we say ah you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book well never a novel he did write your collections of short stories short story sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were in the valley is long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nUm some but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells you know he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little like seeing so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit\nFor you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling or so to get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery or twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but\nHe really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular or documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed route certainly could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking\nDistance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know we live as youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas on the will of eating or it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to distance yeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going\nBack to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic\nA man is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that stuff\n[laughter] ever [laughter] and then just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and starve to ever Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas per E.

today watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\nWell I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restaurant was riding obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the just the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he is certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he\nHe would hate reality TV on the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life or this is your life with a show where they bring somebody on the show it in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will\nTrot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWoolen old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nAnd they were all older white guys you\nKnow in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys [laughter] where did the television\nYou know it would be difficult to get that kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um the field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be this kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know young you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin players from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it\nGives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS CBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIt's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white\nAnd of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was watering from Nick\nIf he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set\nAnd the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make\nThe actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the beholder or you know nightmare twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumped started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon\nTo be Robert Redford yay yay has learned Redford actually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that\nRod Serling had written called in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her a I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders\nAnd and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series is it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin a person you know ha says a few things\nWe found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because everybody thought she was ugly in a she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and\nThat's that's the eye of the beholder and that is\nA puppet master it sounds like a one room a part of it and I could uh I heard rod Serling with Iran could yeah it comes to and once in a while and I always wish I had met and but I never did\nBut I I think that's where he uh send it taped to Los Angeles who uh the uh contrived in\nPeriod a TV program and uh\nYou know he he you know as I say you lived there right on Lake ... uh an in Ithaca and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate and if the guy and and the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well uh\nWhen his career started to think a little bit uh he went back to that area and he caught at a I Believe from Cornell University down there\nAnd uh he uh he buried not far from it about where it comes in a little cemetery called uh enter lake and write on a lake in much the love that area and that white or when they first got married they had their honeymoon there a\nOn a lake a A R parent or her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they live there and they always went back there on a summer you are right and relax and uh\nUh a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion for uh people hey no an area like a shoe or whatever it\nMight be a store I mean we've got a cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and every ... already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a negative sounds like he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses that are as Steve mentioned and\nYeah he would absolutely and and you know going through his correspond to the wire rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent he ever get a letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist than you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received\nPersonally you know personal letters written signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and it's really amazing that that you can't really find somebody saying a bad word about red certainly\nDo you really can't Nick we're going to take

step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nMuch stuff we go to in Tulsa, Oklahoma and we're taking away I appreciated\nGeorgia and Nick Sterling man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know everyone wanted his shows has a point to it that he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of their experiences at a combat soldier during World War two which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming home from Italy\nCrashes in the desert the capital of that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and Bob coming it's just having me walking by a scene is newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd ah he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we lived experience even though he didn't fly that and you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd having psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock\nOf seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies closing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time to be twenty five crashed you know struggle with those shows that Ross darling did\nThey had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to after events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed\nYou know at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany that already thought he could alter that event\nOf course but a man I don't know it'd be hard to say which be my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney\nPlayed the ah Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine\nHand when he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus years it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously baggage to all of a sudden became full of gifts this did it uh you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy who ran a department store they found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John free sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes in here and goes where'd you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gifts blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out\nLooking at the police station and the department store owner came in there so yeah there it is there's the merchandise call well you're the blah blah blah you know\nAnd uh the guy's name was Mr done department store owner right and and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty cans in it right\nAnd so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gas recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raised in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it\nTo Mr gundy [noise] you know said merry Christmas and both of them got pretty pretty toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer and ... and that right there just catches my heart every time\nLimit and you did you mentioned something about cans remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in this while its own feature film as well uh about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can feel young again and of course they do become young again by plane kick the can and\nAnd the one person who was against it the whole time he didn't play and he didn't get to become young and he regrets it obviously and and that that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually that's a terrific episode\nWe're running out of the time your neck

I don't think it helps in the long run for these candidates and somebody like I'm Better work is a really he's a really strong candidate and his own white\nAnd he's a congressman from the household

actually does look a lot like Robert Kennedy she can't help that\nUm but it makes them a little bit of a shorthand candidate you know he's good looking at ... but what else is there there's a lot more to him but I think that um that getting this kind of enthusiasm and attention and um and expectations really starts to weigh a candidate down and when you get to this point in the campaign\nOr speak with Patricia Murphy columnist at roll call about her piece titled is Beto O'Rourke the next Jon Ossoff what was the point you made through about a week and the giant when it comes to
