Ah yes now one of the problems that I have\nIs this a security clearance and for many other reasons as well or if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen\nI Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh uh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to show and so yes I'm\nI Will tell them partially

ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case you can't have your son contact him\nThere aren't there you know and it's been ... years

here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning a micro per year for a long track all did a cover up a book like All right\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate exactly\nA absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that oh we call basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much a does a session on a target and they're wrong out of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing is well this is one reason why I never\nUm oh\nAsk the same exact question to two different viewers you know each other\nWell this brings me back to end deems a tapes which\nGenerally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's uh my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show Drake effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote view correctly the more who learn to remote view incorrectly the\nEasier it will be to learn encourage excuse me incorrectly ... and uh this is my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh\nThat I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder lake effect just a you know the hundred monkey if that's your uh just uh almost destroyed any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYoung well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released did it very or relatively uh comparatively inexpensive prices\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it ... and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen more

cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well we'll have to ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kinda stuff psychics goes on houses ... miracles that's you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about this miracles that also makes like lake monsters and you know Loch Ness things like that UFOs reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is known for solving mysteries um the Santa Fe court house goes in two

and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a critical\nThinking folklore point of view and so one so part of the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like for if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at goes again all\nRight you know it's like they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there was a monster out there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and\nSo that that's that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean\nUm and it would be a profit and oftentimes the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who died the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitious about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be would or why the candle from a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with the Republican mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so it always or another one example of a body for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was the particular holiday tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked with over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the ... of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know

five Ninety Days yesterday dot com toasted toast\n\nWelcome back because because I Am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it\nReally does have um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get the panic in gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that we are the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nHe went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... and when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to use that actually\nI was just such an offensive as like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year there was X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also\nI'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office X. rated the candy and and I followed\nThat for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah\nI don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think it's dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers okay but he did it yes so then you can feel the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] and then all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second we use of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the witch trials be have you know they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um\nOf course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right you'd actually\nYeah family is coming together to make a kid's costume ...\nWhat you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm a they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing\nIt has turned Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer or to drag\nYeah and of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right you have and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade caution that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a an ethno your question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we're with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as el night I mean there's the other like ours and stuff it's like\nScary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think it really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kid of eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nYou know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of your virtual go you know where you\nGot like holy crap [laughter] oh you got to that because he had that late this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to ask them about the same panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is willing to wean tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\n\nStillwater, Oklahoma and visit them on line at W.

talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's\nA science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it\nBut I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as\nI like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creeping from you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab the grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... from the conservative cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nYou know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is twenty two Eighteen\nYou know ... not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of the genes hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking into ghosts and\nAnd on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said a word you're bored or strictly prohibited anyone using ... board will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know the more corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so\nYou know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party\nSo the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from how this is our way into the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in there like I said again you know black lights and uh\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest events like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was the wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when\nIt came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrow either right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great oh I'm doing is taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to ah grad that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here that\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face would last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the\nFight there you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now are so well\nKnowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff now another element\nIs some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nOn the Web case yesterday dot com [noise]\n\nWith me I've got crystal distraught I'm from a historic Arkansas River walk from stuff for the whole family coming up for Halloween\nRapidly absolutely so and talking with you neck and\nGetting together this whole idea of having a trick or treat on the river walk we have successfully pulled it together and we're ready to move forward with it so in October twenty seventh will be our ... um Halloween trick or treat on the river walk\nA fine we have so many people who are going to be down there on that little mile trail as if they're going to be bringing their Nineteen fifties um\nPolice car and their new police car down\nTo the boost that there'll be handing out candy\nCut it off a little bit yeah yeah so it's going to be visually fun to look good stuff so what's the cost\nIt's free it's free to everybody so on anybody who wants to come down and trick or treat and even people who\nWould like to hand out candy booth space is free we just want everybody to have a unsafe I'm pre Halloween on October twenty seventh or well that's good to have you\n[noise]\n\nMm\n[noise] no\nWe ...

a former carpenter\nAnd so now what you do is you like to ... year retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nThat's correct on it yeah it seems to be\nOf like but I imagine imagine the sediments and everything is produced sort of fertile ground very fertile ground well yeah yeah I don't think that's why the cows and not race offices in it you know the\nFirst thing in\nThe Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it sightseeing or you know\nAnd he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and ... and places that he shouldn't have been on private land and um\nIt was a place called Fox called the world in green Dale which is\nEight miles from flicks and and he still lives in Glendale and it's an interesting story he said it was with a friend they said need noted for the past week or two weeks that\nSomething was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what might it might snow to catch the rub it in the has the other game small game\nAnd it was ... ice is proper sort of Burlington type born and bred and he's with pretty ragged him out to ... as\nYou said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you know still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or they ... as you look over towards the ... the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching in the daytime\nSo there's a large hedge hall forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall\nAnd he will he sought to turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and is peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said and he thought he was a young hopes it meant halls so HBO to bless each other for a while you'll also first\n... believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small town it or you you know your horse he\nSaid and the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expert to host a London move forward because the the momentum this thing just landed and stuff like a magnet sudden something not to look at that he\nSaid it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he glad them before they run away he said what he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it to the store open to the bean over seven foot and looked like a body builder it said you know it's a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd nothing is is that exact words and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both terriers\nAnd not what he ... he says well he said I went to the edge of them to try and get a fence stave it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world\nOr what quite incredible um you know\nThat's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county and if you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the piece the bombs to drain the featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd you said you are supposed to be aware of that was such a ... going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported that moving along the coast and if you go for the ... the coast you've got\nOld folklore legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven ... they are rich and the ... and you know these stories have to have that they've come down the behind the down in time ... ... there's just I think there's grains of truth in the store is\nSo that was the site thing in the Nineteen seventies and lived in Britain they'll all his life and he's never seen it since\nHe's never seen it before that and he never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to the library you would think they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it county\nMade yeah and that's what you're saying that they pop pop out along the way of like when I did before we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's in a remote viewer in I Would have heard target Bigfoot and as she targeted she had mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she is looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they were in time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where we're at human would see him\nUm I find I find it also interesting\nUh when you were saying that Ari yes is there the world's oldest the operational radar base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens\nAnd I think I remember seeing a picture\nThat might be my own about it so people just it's cutting in and out\nNo well is showing no oh no I'm Sorry about Joe meant to hang up and you\nKnow well well you're flying right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think

mutilation\nRate which was eleven miles from stuff like that one was that one was about seven sixty eight but he was still operational to\nAnd from the edge you know the idea that remain\nOkay now

Willis wean talking with been Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's ... it's scary and get say panic and gets kind of\nCrazy I enjoy watching the ah television shows around that kind of Halloween and that we are the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that's the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and yeah when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you Zach Zach\nWe I was just such an offensive I was like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all\nAnd you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I wanted for but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you\nDo people really you know you\nAre the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they have the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make it just toss it the way I just\nWhole thing is just silly now my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy makers that okay but he did it yes so then you can see all this stuff that he won\n[laughter] what were the ethics hear what you know we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the hunted since come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] and all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily districts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second we use of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact you we mentioned little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nSo your people were having to be creative you know boy\nThe horror right you'd actually have families coming together to make a kid's costume ...\nAnd what you find is that uh the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and you know plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing has turned Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history I think we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future um Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell ... a good question you know I think that um you know\nThe Halloween as I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you were with each\n... each you know a couple of generations you change a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like ours and stuff it's like scary\nScary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think he's really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any of the faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid love just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and ask them for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty you're fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a go of you know where you've\nGot like holographic you've got to that you got to see that he was this giant thing and that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door\nBe cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about the seat panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to coast to coast am I'm ... and this is will is to wean tonight\nNever missed a DJ on a show or a gift and sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\n[noise]\nDo they October seventh what's new today on the radio a radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the remove our ... tracks with leverage with no after day\nGoing measuring break out all our great ... whether you're at home or the stadium the new I already ... collections\nProcedures like oh it's all free heart radio dry at you like it on your smart speaker new shot by Ninety GPS J\nI\nMean we would do or do you invite you to deeply would Mac live such a\nHuge amount of material to imagine how would it be to be ...

Sinclair now we can talk to him about so many things but tonight we're going to talk about the we're ... we're going to talk about the flexed in we're wall\nSo Paul Sinclair Paul welcome to coast to coast how are you\nI'm good can come and thank you very much for me to come here and shut a bit of information you know when I started researching for the true story of at least in little snippets of information\nAnd I found myself\nDoing this research about because I'm I'm no it's an I subscribe to the idea to like come to believe something ... something very real otherwise you know to be reported income\nOver a period is you know through the through the ages I mean [noise]\nAnd ... piece of us where they where the story originates from county which is the ... which is probably\nThe most important archaeological site in Britain and one of the most important science in the world uh you know some of your listeners may not have even heard of it but it's worth it's worth researching and the stock ... is mentally say middle stone age and just give give you a brief outline of the at oh yeah absolutely\nIt's it's a it's a it's a archaeological sites dating back to nine thousand B. C. or as I say there's a middle stone age just after the ice age people settled there\nAre these people were just home together as they actually settled on flicks them stock or\nA it is now the lake is gone now we've got ... tend to be honest with you heard of cows run across stock or you can in certain places you can feel the ground reverberate because he's so ... ... and\nThese are these people I mean this is the evidence of people the first house or home ever built by these early settlers in the U. K. and what's interesting is in the research it turns out that the AK ... also found a red the skull caps are they in like a head dress\nWith holes and for our eyes and an leather straps to all the mumble they believe that these early people or shame on them they practice the Sherman I practice\nUh now I'm not saying that is the reason we have the stories of the flexed and well we'll put it is interesting that when you sort of cast your mind to was that transformation into other animals and other based as they started combing through\nFrom these early people I mean I think we have to consider these things as I say I don't particularly think there's a person running round in quotes off times howling or the moon but I'm One hundred percent believe that the people who've come forward and told me the stories of the flakes too well we'll\nAre telling the truth I mean if you like a refuge was built county in the ... century I took place called spittle corner inflicts than\nIt was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll is made up or in the king was for them\nHe ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge and the night it's a fabulous name what's called a home so he built this refuge to protect Trump travelers from an infestation of salvage base\nI mean like\nYeah it's fabulous some spots where the name spit into a hospital comes from so it was built to that's why they call it spits O'Connor or at least they be devoured I I was lucky enough to contact the people in our own\n... what is now the ... in a after they've been stopped safe to being a refugee hundreds of years ago because this wasn't nine fifty seven\n... this refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously not far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA deal\nBut it was due to protect travelers from an investigation it's Savage beast at\nLeast they be devoured it said now I look to that date and the vote some of the ... and that's what it says under is documentation on the line that you'll find that says this we\nWe must also not forget Coney that you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent in the u._k. and best so\nYou know ... we're not necessarily to an entirely talking about too where will this these stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the line and you and you go into the research you discovered the flakes than\nWas once called ... which is interesting and I am now like stumble old my on old maps those areas afflicts then depicted as well fund\nAnd just a few ... somebody changed the name to make it like like maybe the\nScenes safer or something or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that sounds like ooh there's a reason why that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the world for you know in any case it is true with proper research this can be sort of back to pre if anyone else wanted to look into it\nYou know there's a there's a small village just a few miles away called holding the mountains there and if you break down the name\n... or ... and then go back in history and looks will do some sort of research and housing hound mom they it is they used to be called farms that of the hound mom\nAll these sorts of incredible\nConnections to the wolf and to the dog there was a an hour that stood on some old maps called bomb dog house we realize once again that this does not flow as into the realms of the ... then when I started collecting the stories when I

u._k.\nOut there right now early morning for him and we're talking about basically the werewolf of London the full extent werewolf\nIn particular and uh if you go to our website there's some really great sketches from some of the a witness\nTestimonies of what was seen and we were just talking previously with Paul about the uh werewolf that was seen holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches\nIt's called the by the way he's an artist as well just when you see when you see coming to life\nWell someone you know drawn edits it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses now POM Wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know you're an artist as well and a former harbinger\nShown now what you do you like to eat a retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nThat's ... that's correct on it yeah it seems to be\nFirst thing in\nThe Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it sightseeing or you know\nAnd he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has been ... and places that he shouldn't have been on private land and um\nIt was a place called Fox called the world in green Dale which is eight miles from flicks than and he still lives in ... I mean it's an interesting story he said it was with a friend they said need noted for the past week or two weeks that\nSomething was ripping the proud to be snazzy what might it might snow to catch the rubbish and the has and the other game small game\nAnd it was ... eyes is proper sort of Burlington type born and bred and he's with what he what rocky and I'm Out too much snow as\nYou said but we couldn't source while he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you said there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or they ... as you look over towards the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching in the daytime\nSo there's a large hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall and he will he sought to turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and is peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ...\nHe said what he thought he was a U hauls it meant halls so ... H O the blessing to the phony what are you also first\n... believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small town it or you know your horse is it and the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expert to host a London move forward because the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet\nSudden something not to be made to look at that he said it was\nThe most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he glad them before they run away they said what he was on all fours and he said if it to the store to open to the being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder it said you know it's a tiny waist and the main like a lion and the face of a of a boom\nAnd nothing is is that exact words and he said he's able to almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both\nTerriers and\nNot what he ... he says well he said I went to him to the edge of them to try and get fence stave it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible\nUm you know\nThat's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county\nIf you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bumps than drain that were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd ... this was such a supposed to be aware of that was sort of going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and they could go for the ... the coast you've got\nOld folklore legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven scout I spoke to them they tend to ...\nAnd you know these stories have to have that they've come down the being hunted down in time ... ... there's just I think there's grains of truth in the stories so that was the site thing\nIn the Nineteen seventies and lived in Britain do all his life and he's never seen it since\nNever seen it before that I mean never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to that savvy you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it Coney ... made\nYeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before we had\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote you are in I Would have hurt target and and she ... she mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was she was looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these poodles\nAnd they were in time war and they would just go through in time or another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know we're we're a human with them\nUm I find I find it also interesting when you were saying that Ari yeah is there the world's oldest operational read our base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a sure thing\nThat might be my phone about coats out people just because he's got no no\nNo well is showing no battery it's all now I'm a I'm Sorry about this listener is about to do you want me to hang up and you touch me back because of the\nPiano will well you're flying right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it\nI think it's very strange it is operational radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all these happening now you're talking about\nThat's correct Tony ... and ... ... briefly jumping to them to where the animal mutilation is taking place but then there's a radar based there which is eleven miles from stocks the world as the crow flies and that one's close not one closed about\nSeventy two uh efficiently that's sixty eight but he was still operational up the sparsely until Seventy two\nAnd that's on the edge of the north sea audio them some of the ... the ...\nOkay now he's gone [laughter]\nSo we'll definitely contacting back on one of the other phone in like crazy brand new song a brand new

thirty five I just got the five live coverage in my air conditioner went out a ... a lot of pressure will not get gone\nAnd a very well heck I'll look into lake or the next day or one that started ... and a\nTruck is completely dead uh never had any problems with an air conditioner simply for the fact that I've always on the court [laughter] but anyhow I could help me out I greatly appreciate it\nWe have had a a friend of ours that we buy palettes from and he had some continuing issues with up around in that same era with the air conditioning and\nI'm not the one that manages a shop like rush those when he's here but I Know that in that particular instance they\nDid some battle with the fact that some of the control for that air conditioning system in that vehicle runs back through the power train control module through the engine computer and so it is it is possible now having said this this is a possibility that with something being\nShorted in that compressor and the clutch or something like that that it could be turning on and and uh causing a drain on the on the battery because of that short in the air conditioning compressor so the first thing a person is going to do is give it a physical analysis to see All right\nDo we have refrigerated the system let's just start with the low hanging fruit as the system charged up is the clutch free or or is the clutch itself you know seized up are locked up words it's constantly engaged\nAnd then you have to start working your way back to the electrical system but I Know that was a a challenge for them on that one and so many of the trucks that go down the road\nPulling things uh work trucks the the cooling system in the front gets just compromise considerably and if it needs to be considered every time going to work on the air conditioning system to make sure I'm covered a lot of bases here but to make sure that you always have\nAs good of air flow as possible through the front of that vehicle because that air through the air flow that comes through the air conditioning condense or is what takes that extremely\nHigh temperature compress liquid and brings the temperature back down again to bring it through the process and so you know after it's been through the compressor had there's a lot of heat generated and you need to bring that cooling back down again so\nUh bent over fins we're we're a good chunk of the front of that thing is is is restricted from air bugs or you know huge amounts of dirt if you've been in a really dirty climate these are all things that have to be considered\nAs you inspect that system so if it is electrical and you get it to work because of the the inspection process and the you know maybe have to replace the cultural compressor whatever might happen to be find out what caused the stress on the system to make it\nTo make it failed I got you is there is there a possibility that ... there's a possibility just failed it could just be out and that's what I'm saying you've got to kind of work your way back but make sure you get the things that could have caused exactly anytime you have a failure like that stop from them and say look let's not just fix the failure\nLet's see if there's something in this system is not normal right before we go ahead and move forward and I think that's important advice eight six six five nine for for one five oh\nYou just gave advice and then call you you've named the advice is good there I don't think you can you you kind of gave the advice and then said that that was important advice that I just gave I don't think that's a I don't think he can do that I just did it [laughter] hey I had a home run\nI think you're supposed to be I don't think you're supposed to do that was it a humble bragging might've but they say for the call the outlet everyone else no back to Jim Jim\nYou're on the end of the show what can we do for ya\nHey guys I had a gentleman yesterday he broke down here to Nineteen Ninety four after he fifty Irish Chevy man [noise] so\nI was trying to get it to a we're just sort of ran out of gas but we figured that out and didn't run out of gas I have no spark\nSo we'll we tested the coil but I had power going into the distributor but I have nothing coming out so I'm guessing it's the module on the side of the distributor\nThat'd be the most logical gas on those Fords it's something that did fail a lot that the film module and especially with age and he they would break down and they seem to be when they first started going bad it would be under heat they would die and then you let 'em cool down and they would start again but apparently you didn't have that happen or you would have tried that he uh\nI came by my place and they I was on a highway Seventy seven earn it quit and he just assumed it was out of gas we put gas in and it started back up around for maybe ten seconds later quit again\nSo I thought we weren't getting fuel and then after I Try to push these are in it and then it didn't have any of that I\nFound spark problem but if you sit and I told him that if I would've had a creator Chevrolet I could have fixed it but if\nSit Nineteen Ninety or Nineteen Ninety four\nNineteen Ninety was a Nineteen Ninety three fifty or with a five point it gas\nOr one of the state one of the things that I Would check and just 'cause I've experienced this myself is\nThat they ran the power for the engine control system or the early ... system they called it with a they had the ground I Believe run right off the battery and we've seen a couple of different times of their own vehicles were just overtime that wiring that came to the battery got corroded\nAnd that smaller wire that comes off the battery was not making a good connection\nAnd you could go up there and you could you could wait till that wire and you could get the power to come back to get the spark that 'cause you could read power the computer\nOr re power the power system in there it's a it's an early systems I I Would start with the low hanging fruit of checking the connections of the small wires and actually at the battery there and and kind of backtrack from there to try something I've seen today\nBut it looks like they're going to have to take the distributor out to get a module off but I Can't see any other way to get that might go off don't looks like there's any room to work\nThey've got to talk back and they're really nice for you yeah [laughter]\nYeah they gotta do Chevrolet and have it fixed by now\nSo well you know everybody's got their favorites [laughter] well thanks for the call Bailey thanks very much are they I think he's on the right track 'cause that was a common failure pointed those of those units\nThat's a timely a comment\nThere with just the Ford and the Chevy we've had Facebook conversations of recent\nUh ... words the exact same thing for it and Chevy just back and forth much more good natured than other arguments I've seen lately but I think I think the gym was just ... everybody knew where he should have eight six six five nine for for one five oh\nHi this is capital I have a thousand five or ... I have two sons that are mechanics and my car has like two hundred and sixty five thousand miles on just tired of it and they could kind of funny you know I and our our son sound it sounds like it's kind of liquor hadn't gasket\nIn the heat or box on the ... it's on the exterior but it's in there for for air to blow through it and keep it cool\nAnd and the old cars he used to be kind of like a thermostat spring coil that would hang down in there is the resistor and it kind of an old school thing that you'd see and then as they've gotten more advanced with the technology now it's a solid state device that will sit in\nLower area a lot of times it's melted under the under the dashing ... on the heater boxer near the heater box but if you can follow that wiring back\nFrom the blower motor you typically find this this next piece and my hunch is is that you may have weakened that when you're blower motor went out the first time and it may have just decided to to give up and that may not be giving you your full range of control because you need a full twelve votes to run that isn't the high speed you don't have\nTrick which is kind of weird a lot of times they fail out where they they failed nice work it out and stay on the high and not the lower speeds 'cause uh 'cause the resistor will or the south St device will help control that saying don't do it slower speeds so it is a bit opposite that way\nSo there's there they can check that system\nI'd say fairly easily for a technician that's got the the right skills because they're going to look for what what current is getting that blower motor and then they're going to work their way back to circuit and my hunch is they might find the problem right there in the in that blower control that's in the inner ear intermediary between the the the switch in the in the motor\nSteve thanks very much for the call good luck let's talk to John John you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\n[noise] ah yeah I got a a Ninety five Chevy course of the car with the ah three one respects\nUm then having issues oh I'd say the last four or five years of this phenomena are just going on and so on and it'll just over ...\nGave me doing zero miles an hour just sitting at a stop light and they do she would always have to like sixty Seventy miles an hour it'll come all the way back down it just sometimes it gives you the correct speeding and sometimes it just it it goes wherever I Want to I didn't know\nIf that's something that with a transmission or I've actually came out\nTo the north ... about a year ago and his place the ah the dash cluster but that doesn't fix it well\nThe system on that car in the ... of course because they were starting to adapt a little more technology ah I think the some of the previous generation cars in the late seventies early eighties still had a cable going up from the transmission to the ... I mean I one of my old train them they just when I drive and I just smile cause you hear this\nAnd it's you you always have just yeah it's the squeak of this phenomena or cable when they would get dry and all these have to pull them out you'd put oil in them\nAnd it was literally a cable that ran from the from down by the transmission up to this predominant but now they've used pulse signals that are set up to be able to make that or to make that go and there is a speed sensor on the transmission and if you had two clusters do the same thing that's a good self test to know that\nYou either got a problem with that wiring circuit that plug in\nOr the actual censor itself it's right on the transmission and you should be able to buy that that a sensor yet I Would think for not a lot of money but if not that might be something you could find that a cell service facility where you could go out and for a few dollars take one off it comes off the end of the transmission where the actual the actual housing part of it is\nAnd I believe that has a\nIt has a dual signal on if I remember right on that car and it sends one feed to the engine computer and one seed would still be used for the speed single they hadn't split\nOh yeah that that makes sense because my plug in ... uh it'll show a vehicle speed\nAnd that won't change from the from the dash\nYeah so I think if you I think if you look at that when you're gonna find it's got to outputs on his feet sensor and uh I Would check those circuits and check that censor and you are hoping figure that one out thanks for calling John thanks very much for the call we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back on the end of the show [noise]\nWe've all had a garden hose gadget that didn't live up to our expectations but we

every day\n[noise] auto parts\nComing you kind of every time how long have you been doing this\nWell just about two weeks I thought he looked for it was something different but no it's just been staying the same\nAnd I got to start with the the the first steps a check to the break fluids levels that's all we're supposed to be\nYup there's no leaks or anything around\nBut that's it's always the first step when you're having what feels like a hydraulic or mechanical issue on your breaks I mean even with the analog breaks even with the the newest systems he's still got to make sure in check that level to make sure something hasn't happened where you've\nYou've had a fluid last so having that set aside and I'm trying to think on that one time that you've got there is that have the the hydraulic braking system on it or is it a vacuum of sift you happen to know\nA vacuum of shift OK ... can\nGet a vacuum break booster up on the fire wall that you're that that's going to give you that vacuum assisted makes the pedal not seem so hard this\nIs the vacuum coming to it through the ... for that yeah there's plenty of vacuum there should work\nWhen you step on the brakes and it bottoms out where we're stopping the vehicle do you ever get nervous that it's not going to stop the vehicle\nWell yes just about because there is just a little bit down there but boy you're just jamming airstrip for for a floor\nBut what do I want to stop\nAll right well my my first my first instinct is is that you may have a master's still are starting to fail that is not what you're describing typically an indication of a problem with like you know people getting deeper with some of the calls we get where they're having\nPesky intermittent problems or breaks that are fading away different things that we've gotten into some of these newer systems will be unlike breaks you got to be concerned about but this sounds to me like a more traditional\nHydraulic bypass words words bypassing that hydraulic pressure\nIn the in the master sooner itself possibly you got you know California on the front wheels and I think that oh three you've got you should've by now I have ... on the back wheels also not drawn breaks you can see everything\nSo you know I haven't lost fluid inspected the lines you you're not see anything wrong there\nIf you've got plenty of material on your pads because that will happen to sometimes when the ... the brakes gets so worn down and you can you can get some pretty unusual pedal feel it but they've got to be pretty well worn down for that and I'm gonna assume just by the whole reasonable you talk\nAbout your problem that you've you've probably inspected that also\nSo my my first one which would be is that you've got a\nFailure going on are starting to come out with your break masters cylinder which is kind of an old school problem and it's by passing\nBy jam them on a real hard you know I can stand on the pedal it doesn't go down after that you know like it's slipping by either ups or something\nYeah so you're you're that makes you wonder about whether that's what it is\n[noise] well we we went on\nI ... just on plug 'em all that make a difference\nWhy no one we were out at the I talk about the few times but we go out to the driving school we've done a couple of times they disconnect or power down the brakes systems on some of their cars just to show what it's like to do an emergency braking situation without intellect breaks and yes the hydraulic should work just the same\nA minus the assist of that feature so if he pulled the fuse on that it'd be a good way to you could eliminate that from the system but I I really don't think that's where your problem is going to be at I think you're still going to find that problem is somewhere in your\nBreak booster masters cylinder\nArea um you know you could even have a a a booster that's by passing on the inside where on quick hammer it's able to hold but then once you get to a certain point it just it's bleeding by the vacuum inside the you know the big diaphragm inside the booster that could also be it\nUm and so I I still think your problems going to be at the head of the unit\nUp near the this where everything starts not downstream I ... I really do\nGary thanks very much for the call good luck and\nMaybe stop driving it till you're ... I mean they're well when he does he's getting to the end of the pedals yeah I forgot to ask him but he does he ever read warning light on a cause for other listeners out there you're yellow lights are telling you have a ... especially on the newer cars with the modern braking systems\nWith analog brakes traction control and dynamic suspension control all these different things a yellow light can be an indication of a system trouble\nThat something is out of parameters we can't read us a we'll censor you know it's it's it's a code but a red light still indicates potential hydraulic failure okay or emergency break is on you know something that is immediate so when you see a red brake light ever\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh what else is caught your attention well it's hard not\nTo watch the news or watch it on your phone to see what's going on in the world and not have noticed the amount of flooding that we've had around the ... and I've seen a number of pictures of vehicles floating down streets cars piled up in piles that have been pushed by water people being rescued\nThe amazing part about this is we've talked about flood things before but you're right now when you say that I Can't think of which Pacific area you're talking about because they were so many so many this we've had we've had\nThe the recent hurricanes in the Carolinas that have been just horrible\nAnd uh even in Wisconsin there's been in the early in the season there was ... that that are flooded many areas um you know in our locale we've had five six inches of rain it a shot in in a couple of occasions and so I just want to remind everybody\nHow important it is to understand a couple of things about your vehicle and water ...\nAnd most all of the cars now have a air intake system that is that is like a vacuum\nIt it truly is like a vacuum pulling air in it it's pushed area and it pulls it into the intake system in the car but as super super powerful it is it is and so when you go to cross any sort of the intersection where the water is deeper than the bottom part of your bumper you take a risk\nSplashing up sucking in water and all it takes is a\nHalf a cup of water coming in to it a highly highly tuned engine that doesn't have a lot of clearance anyway if it sucks that through\nYou can kill your engine immediately\nAnd your vehicle will be stranded with you in it out in the middle ... yeah with a very expensive repair to come and most likely what will happen is you'll get stuck out there and then the water will continue to rise and then you will have a flooded car ah so you ... you have to heed the warnings and\nAnd use that common sense if it's a road that you travel all the time and you know that the boy this doesn't look good or you've seen somebody drive through in a pickup truck that's got taller tires and taller wheels and it's it's up to the middle of their wheels you\nShould not go through that with your with your car or light than any of those things 'cause\nTo me that is that is probably number one is you're going to suck up water with your large vacuum that you're driving and you're going to damage the engine you you're going to kill the engine right out in the middle of the water and and if it's a new event or a rising water event you're gonna be stuck right there ... now\nThat the next part is the fact that the loss attraction and the floating that happens when you get into too deep water role of a sudden you're drifting off the roadway into\nA ditch next to you that could be a deeper Chaz them um you know the edge of covert I've seen some really bad situations uh with cars that we've picked up as salvaged vehicles and we get to hear a little bit of the story from the ... operator or whoever might happen to be some just some really really tough situations that people have put themselves into\nMost of the time it's been by a choice that they made and where they drove that they should not have drove or they should have just stopped and went back and other direction and so it's always good to give that advice\nAnd I deal with this in my job almost you know anytime there's a storm situation that I'm On the radio so we we talk about that stuff all the time and it is I I Want to impress the first part of that because we get into calls all the time were listeners will call and\nThe the standard for the national weather service from emergency services never drive through water\nAnd there are people that will say no I knew that was safer I knew I knew that the road was there it wasn't dangerous because the guy went before me or but and then I always go back to that part where if you suck water into your engine the engine is completely done and that's ... that's the number one reason not to drive into the water but then yes you do get into those hazard\nSituations where you can't see what\nOther obstacles might be under the water and it it can be it can be a bad situation and that's when all of a sudden you watch and you see people that\nAre being rescued out of their car because it's ... they've gotten and wrapped in it or you just really got to pay you really got to be wise and I think as a as a whole\nCountry we've we've put ourselves in such a hurry all the time we got to be here I got to be there I've I've got to make it here a little pause and think about it and you're stuck in your vehicle and you're here in the middle of an intersection that's growing with water coming up real fast\nYou didn't you don't have time to be stuck there either right and and plus the the dollars of damage that can be done can be budget changing in a hurry because a few sucking water into an engine in it and it comes in fast enough and enough of it what happens inside there is the\nIs the pistons are moving up and down and that water comes it creates a hydra lock and that hydro lock is either going to bend down or break a connecting rod or veils um and these are all deep internal problems in the engine that are in most cases\nThey're repair all that you're going up replacing the ... right and I've I haven't I haven't talked to any insurance companies yet\nThat haven't but I I wouldn't be surprised at some point\nIf an insurance company were to come back to people in saying their policy that if\nYou chose to drive into a flooded road mhm we may not cover you I'm not saying they've ever done that but I Would not be surprised at some point if that came up you know it's something they would say if you're driving on a perfectly good road and ...\nTo drive into a flooded intersection and killed your car\nWhether they ... you wouldn't want to offer like an extra protection either because you wouldn't want to\nEncourage encourage it so I'm just I really want people to be wise about it and then we get into the subject of okay we've got this flooded car\nWhat what happens with it if the vehicle\nHas just had that happen where it sucks the water in kills the engine the things that are under the hood are designed to be water resistant\nA it's kind of like a apple\nWatch or something depending what generation you get there is a big difference between waterproof and water because you get what yes yeah it it knows it's going to drive down the road and have rainwater snow slush all these things coming up against it but once that level of rainwater\nOr floodwater caused by rainwater or pushed in search for the old right or whatever I'd have to be a gets high enough where it is starting to intrude into the passenger compartment\nThat's when you start to get a little more nervous about that car in what's going to happen with it and so people talk about what you know fixing flood cars and this sort of things I've been around a lot of that too and\nMy advice is typically\nSalt water\nIf it's if you're on the coast listening to us and you've got the the truth the salt water coming from the ocean that gets up inside the vehicle\nMove on the insurance can be very typically say move on mhm I I Would not\nI wouldn't fix I've just seen the the or the ugliness for mess with even if you get a really good deal it it's just probably not worth it because that salt water just as so corrosive I mean if you did take the car apart and and and and threw away whatever wiring harnesses the salt water got into it put new ones in\nThe body of the cars going to be fine but it's any of the electronics or any of the wiring any of the systems or any of the unprotected metal for that matter up under the dash under the seats are just be very very cautious with the stuff that salt water has gotten into freshwater\nA lot of that if you clean it will take things apart well dry them out well and follow a good process it can be done but it's not a quick fix it's still a time consuming tedious process that has\nTo be followed all the way down to where the water wasn't before you're going to have a proper repair on that view\nThat'll do it for another hour of the under the hood show

answer your automotive\nWe can do that 'cause it was it was the same engine family it was just a larger born stroke and some of these we had to change the throttle body feeling directors and a couple of other things to make to make it all communicate correctly and I think that's the real he's trying to go down as like can I use this long block\nAnd then adapt the components in the top that is not a conversation for everybody sure that it's it's it's it's a for people that are really into\nWhat Mary's with what\nThis is a conversation for people you would bring your car to to see if it can be done right [laughter] yeah and and they would probably not want to do it because they are not going to be able to pay them for the time it would take to do the research in the sun I wanted to make it happen\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call the came into the hotline\nHello this is ... and I've got a few thousand sixteen Chevy six points ... the so and was wondering [noise] on the death fluid on it how hard that is on the motors if you're better off to spend the money to have 'em deleted\nOr what's your guy just thoughts are\nWell thanks for the call and I will I Will start off with\nThis deleting a factory\nClean air emissions device comes with ramifications and Google that we see it on the news then there's been a number of companies that have crossed that line to allow tools to let people delete\nDevices and that is typically always going to end up with a\nProbably a federal case against that company at some point if they're going down that road acclaimed probably won't go to jail for it no but somebody else might be right in the company that made the device and so there's a big difference between\nAdjusting parameters and the leading a device uh there's there's adjustments that can be made with in the standards and there's adjustments that take you\nOutside of what was permissible and so you got to be really careful about that the death fluid itself\nIs not it's being injected into the exhaust catalyst to help with the the burning of that it's not\nIt's not something that you are mixing with your fuel per se and what I've seen with my sister having two of these trucks\nWell she's had more than two she's traded and had a number of these trucks since two thousand eleven when they think it was eleven when they added the deaf into the ... she was one of our first desk calls I Believe yeah and the and the diesel yeah she had her first one was a little problematic handed to fight with a little bit\nBut they're able to use that system to get\nBetter overall fuel economy out of it because they can\nRelieve some of the other devices that are re circulating exhaust gas and and doing filtering to clean the air up on the inside because they can create this catalyst effect with the with the diesel exhaust fluid or in a more efficient manner the less the engine breathe better for your but\nIt's at the expense of having that that added a process of having to put the deaf flew it in a lot of people don't like it because it can restrict you if you have the run low eventually it can slow you down from sixty five and then down to four miles an hour if you don't really if you don't keep the system up\nBut it's gotten to be now where it's common place you're ... it's it's in heavy equipment\nIt's in it's in the trucks it's it's kind of it's became the the more preferred method to get a good clean catalyst affect what does it do I mean we talked about it forever but what is the injection of the diesel exhaust fluid into that catalyst process they're able to create a a more intense somewhere a more a\nMore dramatic effect on that exhaust than it would be just re circulating it they're actually adding to it no it's it's similar in nature to what they did back in the early eighties when they would inject air into the gas systems to make the capitalist system more\nA robust by adding the oxygen into the into that a capitalist system\nAnd so this case they're actually injecting\nThe euro area to to help enhance that process and they can they can clean more efficiently and quickly or with that type of a process and the words are ... exactly what it's what it's called but that is definitely became\nThe more preferred method the reason it was resisted in the beginning I Know international and others in the beginning they tried to stay away from it because they thought just like this customers people aren't gonna want to add this have another tank they have to maintain and another another system that can break\nBut in the end I think they've found that that's how they can get the clean air emission standard that the government wishes to achieve and maintain fuel economy at the same time\nWithout
