{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "In in my presentations and I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man's since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nA and they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is in the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a\n... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have a big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities now want renewal energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nAnd now they are all modern landfills and in Europe in the U. S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats and other room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nOur six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress facts I suffered I oxides or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October him a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the\nGoing with the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of H cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there are causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie\nCalled the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie\nAs well as the events portrayed in the movie ... thousand well with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies could very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their young to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water or the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically\nWas that are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop that current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh eggs\nAnd they'll make your head\nStill doing thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout wind field when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was about twenty four ... booth\nPlane you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas or were you\nNow why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know Chris city now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much you can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be born in ... methane gas now I Want to have you ever been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas\nOr they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having stepmom you're\nStuck into smoking to him several times are hurting on any shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think\nWe should warn are good friends she not to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes there's a are using a lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion\nA papal so two dollars a day comes through two point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or\nA robbery or a young child then oh\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo watch frosty has told us is this is your section thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massively improve their lives they're doing All right with out is just lost the war which a lot of them are\nAre counting

all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold on your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nMood obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port on in in a northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us I grew screwing up\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gun what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosol anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of ...\nSandler harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove that kind of self I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago where an animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but\nHere's the thing that's interesting you can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by harp technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure is on and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's happened with our weather\n... when I hear about it in the new let's can Steve's reaction to that Bruce thank you\nBruce that's something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe that the way that is being gay or engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blogging out son well people have so much heck shoes weren't headache\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off Kim trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's dish to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of this story on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they go away you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything\nNow I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that\nHere's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing a stripping the oil from industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sit there with her sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to play out okay now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLong he's somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the

hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea what it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought it looked clear and they could sit there and rush for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter in a Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable

mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS are using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nA now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area where at night\nFor the hike well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was it you will fall on Tuesday is which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night

global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all sure well that's\nA that's a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the title was think outside the green bucks\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nIn in my presentations that I say this is the uh the third station the United states is man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nA and they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have a big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind\nOr you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system so if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar and people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple\nA the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this is a hundred percent renewable energy sounds good\nUh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty\nNews story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nAnd now they uh all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats and other room and the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants rolled down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress facts I suffered dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so busy or as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October him a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic to a climate discussion I'm so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years that are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot which cycles which are of\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what

the Indian and the Pacific the\nThe theory basically was that are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there were there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream Muslim slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay it's actual thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll act\nThey'll make you\nStill don't think whoa okay go ahead John\n... but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout landfills ... when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay\nAnd I used to drive by the wind meals that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was up by plenty more ... booth plane\nYou know they were were burning off\nAbout methane gas well we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity now\nCome back and they said no no no and it's going to cost too much you can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in

one point three billion a people\nSo two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or\nA robbery or a young child then oh\nHere's the point is you've already said they

Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gun what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt\nClimate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and even ramped up over the last Twenty years\nAnd this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and say no doubt this a lot of\nBut harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him

powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power in the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThat can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's happened with our weather\n... when the only hear about it in the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to the roost like you\nBruce that's something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just did it exactly right

get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's dish to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on

increasingly limiting their spending on the elections and other political activity\nA new report by the center for political accountability\nStudies annual political spending policies that as simply five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers or either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing here\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern and then some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom\nTo swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always had lobbied I've always found a lot of money in Washington and in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what\nThis shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd then when when you talk about interfering in elections with money talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWell so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates in other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political party that can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party a democratic Republican governors ah accent that basically support uh like getting\nGovernors one party or the other or a similar groups for attorney general on for state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little over a third of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money number one or more of these areas\nWhile we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase up backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produced this report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at best that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundreds and fortunately companies\nHave been in the ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclose a in a how and where and when they spend on and in some cases how much they spent on these different electorate activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten worse so for example they used that published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their reports or less\nA informative than they used to be um fewer companies now in part because of new companies joining they asked me five hundred index fewer companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah ah to display their political spending reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies stay in the index it turns out that larger companies and companies that have been in the index longer\nTend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies you referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was the mayor did they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a less forthcoming and me in the center for political accountability is eyes and how they disclose what the restrictions are on a on political spending\nIn talking to me they said their position hasn't changed they still uh don't contribute to political campaigns are candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like Fargo on C. four and five twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language for Adam ... versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of this they don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or and they tell their trade associations not to use their funds\nFor a election activities so that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization that Center for political accountability\nBut then also uh some shareholder activists or shoulder advocates have put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to uh you know Asher older tape\nThe company to produce a political spending record in some circumstances companies either she and how those votes go overtime or just on their own initiative to go to
