they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military\nIt's economic it's diplomatic\nIt's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are\nThey are doing quite well thank you how concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so yeah there are strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might\nMean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states with the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that ah the cars folks sugary situation is is tragic\nUh but if you've been watching Mohammed then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course\nNow they could go to the Chinese and Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is in you know my friend or something like that that\nThe idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous a game of the airplane we see that evolved\nOver the years in Iraq we see it in Syria you know even you know vitamin ... and I would just welcome a president of the sea of Egypt up into Moscow for his fourth visit\nIn the last couple of years and you know they made big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... uh for these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we banned in the ... now\nI'm you know they will run into the arms of putting in putting understands that uh or into the arms of chi into a certain degree\nThat's happening I'm you know we have to

Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos that flew over a you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and your defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for the jet fighters and their bombers of the practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and\nIt's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any end times scenario or is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president of turkey is really a fix to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently ah was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a any consistently has had over the years of very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that\nFollows him closely would dispute that so that these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching have collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there is some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look they're chalk and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had or want her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up through the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being or cooperate and of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the rest\nAnd uh they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ... from the Russians\nAnd of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard one wants to\nAlternately well the it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other like that to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major a bone of contention and of course there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec a viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nAnd how does that change the equation\n[noise] well if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you\nKnow to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of when I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and Iran is going to continue um but it it if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a uranium through wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are have a a more\nA better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking us

colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser\nJohn Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only built but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nThat has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nA possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said I'm ... weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at the United states\nYou know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fall and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course have captured the imagination\nOf the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled a nationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat

space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board\nAnd it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world and you ... on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so now they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you um about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show the um the brutal slaying of of a cause she'll be\nUm and how that might mean there is there or dominoes at play here obviously\nI'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states with the Trump Administration should proceed ah with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this\nA sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that uh the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nUh but if you've been watching Mohammed then so solemn and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nYou know the so called ... and the the desert which he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and had him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based totally upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course\nNow they could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a cry for with and of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got a you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about 'em but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something

Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talk ten ten lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis days with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War heads the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived there had been\nA whole obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly\nUm uh well I wouldn't call them rushing regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered were had heated battles with them a there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea with Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the danger of this\nBreaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh uh the end and anytime scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick Richard you know we had one here recently\nWith the USS a done\nDecatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared in case the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or as a Republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wiped the hands of ... even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario uh\nIs is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the dog and mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president uh el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and to establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you\nKnow the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years\nOf very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so that these are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and\nAnd put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to Washington and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air the one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran and on the

Bush draw Iraq Iran North Korea back the legal\nNow your book is very evil but we are the ones perpetrate evil around the world where these weapons of destruction everywhere even theory or\nOr or or ... did not do one you ever go to ... people you're with a large during that he did for work through a response or\n[noise] you know a lot of sort of question there\nRichard it it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions are under mouth and China\nThey killed millions a and their foreign policy where they\nProvoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support uh yeah we do sell weapons her defense security cooperation agency you know has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like uh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and look what they want today and it's certainly not what my country once\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization\nWhich I look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nAh for for no reason in most places in the world\nA and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in was\nIn a western China today and that's a un report or somebody look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR\nA that was wrong and we've acknowledge that we do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have I've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world and I've seen some pretty bad places um and yet you know it's\nAlways wonderful to come back home to the United states uh where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid as Richard pointed out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had 'em for families being carted away and yet uh unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGot to jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War

the under the show we're glad you're joining U.S Russian Shannon are both here I'm Chris Carter here to answer your calls at eight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call that came into the hotline\nHi my name is art I have a ... on a boat or all it's a cut cut away Schatz twenty sold it to me with one thousand miles on it it was a\nAnd the Raj a problem with the end and it ended up being a far south as nine or ... as a lake a horror show every three to four hundred miles an annual trip out back\nWow the owner or last donor I Want to know if I can I ask you on that and about ... terrible at it as this area a fresh air and the answer if a particular a\nProblem I've described it from\nThe time I enjoy your show\nA chord of oil every hundred and fifty to two hundred miles seems like\nA lot ... on the ground you know that's a that's a lot we can now that may be a head gasket or something else you're going to find out where the leak is from first and see if you want to go on with any further repairs 'cause it was a head gasket Lincoln and that was running out or ... covers yeah then those\nOther ... unusual on a big the like that yeah it that you normally when you get that kind of oil consumption on a V. eight 'cause I'm assuming this to be a Fort Dodge GM chassis which is going to be there are three fifty or a or a three fifty one or or or you know or sixty four yeah there's just different things like that it could be an ... they're going to be\nEating that oil not leaking it most likely but as far as the valve the valves go if if it was if the liquid something separate and you could identify how to fix the leak\nThose older the eight engine it is not always a bad idea to to remove the heads and fix the fix the valves at a machine shop and put that motor back to health again with is low mileage as you have on the bottom end yet\nStuck to Jim Jim you're on the end of the ... what can we do for ya\nRecently read an article about a company in England that has developed a new engine that gets rid of the timing chain timing belt [noise] felt springs in the valves are controlled by computer controlled electric motors and by doing it that way this company\nHas been able to do die in a mom and her testing what this engine and the emissions are reduced by about twenty percent\nAnd they explain that the way they get the computer to time the opening and closing of the valves is they place a sensor up some time on the crane shaft and from reading that article it just really interesting it seems like just when you think\nA gas engine really cannot be improved the very much\nSomebody comes up with this new system to control the opening and closing all the valves and it just looked super cool I just hope that they can continue to develop this engine and get it into a vehicle\nSome day because it just a a huge advancements in terms of using computers to make engines more efficient\nThey've already got some similar to that in America in in our cars now they've taken the throttle body off the car completely\nAnd what they've done is they use the\nThey're using oil pressure to power the valve and an electronic solemn wide open and close it and they open the valve they open it more or less to control the Airflow so they open up more than its like opening the throttle body they open that less to cut it down those those are still using timing changed\nThe one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that but these these cars that you're talking about they don't even have a throttle body on them anymore they just have a whole like a diesel doesn't the intake with an air filter or a turbo chargers\nBut there's no there's no blade in there to control the the Airflow at all anymore which moves out the Airflow changed everything just changes on 'em and\nIt's like a a better mouse trap you never thought they could come up with a better one\nThen they came up with a piece of sticky tape but uh [laughter] you know these engines it is true they are coming up and we think that's as far as they can go advanced I'll bet there'll be something\nThe manufacturers are there are screaming and screaming it'd be a bit of exaggeration but they really want us to get higher octane fuels across the whole fleet and if they can do that there's there is guys limit type of things they can do\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call came in after hours\nMy name is ... I have a two thousand five square feet or with the two point four cylinder engine and you'll find speed transmission the problems that we have 'cause during the summer they were going on and extended trip a and\nDriving at about Seventy miles an hour\nAt for about three hours on the road if the temperature seems to get above eighty five degrees the incident starts cutting out like it's starving for gas we have replaced thermostat um but I don't have any other answers or hopefully you have an idea that\nThe when we get those cars indoor shop that only ACT UP on certain days certain time certain temperature certain drives they can be very difficult to diagnose and some of them we just flat out turn away and say in less this thing does it when you bring it in so we can get it and drive and check it\nWe're just not going to do it right now you're going to have to put up with it until it gets worse\nAnd in some cases they've already been to other shops and said well I spent a hundred to two hundred bucks and another shop and they looked at it and they didn't find anything and and I got charged and it didn't get fixed so I feel a little better when I say I'd rather not touch it then and do it do you uh service than just walk\nAway an absence of any lights or any sort of an indication that you could find out that makes it very very difficult though Ross with your best advice I Know mine would be if you know that on a warm day on a heavy Dr ... it'll do it and it's not straining you that might be the time to call and say hey\nToday I Know I'm going to be driving out around the town is a good chance it happen if I stopped in this afternoon it's doing it can we you know ... and override\nThat's that's the time we're going to do it and I might tell a customer you know if you can do it and driving while it's doing it we got will have a minimum charge of X dollars we will drive and hook it up while it's occurring if it's not going to be occurring\nWe're just not going to do it the Volkswagen Beetle people's car which they've stopped making or they're stopping making what\nWhat was the last I Believe that was a announced Seventeen or Eighteen is read this while I was gone no no this is all new marriages are sold\nTesla has proven how difficult it can be ... be to produce a car from scratch without infrastructure in place for decades of assembly line experience GM and Honda have both\nThey do so that's a ... and that's what everybody\nKeeps saying is that Tesla is is pushing the marketing amazing way and there there was an article I I I caught the headline on when they got to be careful of headline teases now in days but uh the fact was that BMWs recognizing the pressure that\nYou know is being put on their midsize sedan by the by the model three I'm ... and it it's it's real\nBut uh the the challenge for an upstart make or just like you said is that they can be innovative they can be pushing the boundaries\nBut they don't have that head start on actually having the facility to get built and if the other manufacturers decide you know it's our turn to jump in all of a sudden the game just changed and they have to be so established to withstand that\nAnd now everybody and water and what I've learned about I loved living in a pool by myself but everybody else gets it gets harder to swim the ... river might have been watching and seeing what was going on while I was there to test the store and talking to some people that were a little more knowledgeable than me which was everybody there at the store\nThey're gearing up and they know that they're behind in production and they know they're a start up which when you look at Tesla or any car company that's I mean look there there quite a ways they ought to start now they were right but they were they were a nobody I think it was they said it was\nTwo or three college kids that were coming out that it wasn't even must that came up with Tesla it was these college guys and then it was taken taken over\nSo as an electric car but they started with nothing and the brutal where they are and they're ... imagine us guys if we decided we wanted to start up a bicycle company and compete was when ... no it's not going to happen so you start ... they've really made a mark\nBut one thing they did say they said no look\nOur plants are smaller and we're trying to do this right to get it the way we want but once we get there\nThey said their technology they have to build the cars once they get it to capacity is far beyond what the manufacturers have their like\nGuys come on we can send a rocket to space and landed on a platform that's moving and the notion that there's only maybe we can have a an entire plant that assembles cars with less than a third of the moving parts so they go together quicker\nHundred percent with robots can work twenty four hours round the clock and quickly they said if we ever hit that mark\nWe can do it and I think the other manufacturers are going to follow suit hopefully they'll bring our car\nCoastal if they're any a start up billionaires out there who want to buy a radio show yeah I mean not just put ... I mean if you would like to advertise on it but if you just want it and want us off [laughter] go shading plate right All right let's take a quick break you're listening to the end of the show\nWe recently sat down with Greg zip Adelie competition director for Stewart Haass racing as of today they've won five of the first eleven races for the twenty teens season Greg talked about the importance of the relationship with with filters\nYeah here it's it's too hot we're fortunate to have a number of\nTechnical partners I mean obviously to perform at a level that that we need to do and what I mean by that is if we can align ourselves with um companies that can help us have an edge in performance then we're better than our competitors and and for many years which has helped us design or\nAll kinds of filters especially the air filters and do a phenomenal job\nAllowing us to package the maximum airfield their size and our air boxes were always you know looking for that little bit extra edge um so we're always looking at you know different police in different cloth and things from that nature and and and they're always there to help us an answer all of our needs\nLearn more

is that it's kind of a universal platform car they're trying to make like OK okay I've got you know they used to be able to take your cars what was that thing you'd get when you're I saw that you could get one chassis and switch a bunch of\nBody or the store or the old oh I had a name and one of our ... going to tell us just like we said what was the you know the ... we're talking about the yeah the ... it's like it's all on the verge of wanting to see a picture of what's that like the late eighties right\nYeah and it was like a it was like a component you could dress it up to different things but yes there used to be a ... a store in the mall of America you can do the same thing yeah not the famous you're talking about\nYou know this was the thing that we ... the ... up on the ice book make sure it's the one from the eighties that you could change we go figure out what that was\n... eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's go to Texas and talk to Hernandez Hernandez you're on the under the hood show what can we do for\nA yes or how are you today [noise] fantastic [noise] yes\nI have a question I have a thousand or a dog got the bottom line come in and taking about a three hour trip and about halfway on this trip up to get something to drink and the conditions of working perfectly there's nothing wrong with it\nGet back in ... and a lot more cold anymore okay they later I just saw when I got there and I that I come back I didn't have air conditioner so uh uh my trip and I got a mother or a different today\nAnd the batteries are completely dead now I notice about compressor will knock it gone but that is a problem with that\nIs there something that connected to what my battery died or that or\nI think they're connected you know we had a cold similar this on the hotline I'm at a previous show but I think\nThis is where we this is the same problem that our friend vendor head was oh it was his uh palate trucks why do you have to mention that because I was thinking of a bad experience for him and for us what it was a learning experience all expensive learning experience that was bought\nThis had the this was exactly same here same\nAs the fact that you guys had to pay for this and he had to pay for it is going to help Hernandez 'cause\nYou guys known as a friend of ours for forty years helps solve your problem it would be something for only about two grand no uh it it could be you know it was about to rent it could be the same problem although you might have something different but it is worth checking into because we're aware\nThat this could be things so there is a device here's a path to look at the path to look at under the hood there's a thing called an F.

M. a front control model you open the hood it's basically that fuse boxes on the driver's side fender\nUh [noise] they fail and when they fail that's what controls racy compressor everything's run them through that and you can lose\nThe compressor but it can also kick in and all that his you would shut it off the compressor wouldn't work\nBut the really would kick in now and then engage that compressor and run the batteries that overnight and then when you drive down the road the compressor would not break when he tells the turn on it wouldn't turn to rely on and run the AC hit and it just occurred like that overnight\nAnd the next day the batteries were didn't like what is going on and then we drove for a week no problem the batteries did not go dead but the compressor didn't work\nAnd then all of a sudden the compressor started working with the batteries went dead every night it was stuck on all the time it turned out to be it was in that frontal control macho so how we diagnose it is we get the circuit diagrams and find out do I have any electricity\nVoltage coming out of that F. C. M. to POWER UP that compressor and if we don't but we have a signal coming into it which we can read from our scanner and physically with a meter oh we know we've got something going on with a module and then with the vehicle off just\nCheck this out when you turn your vehicle off and you know it's probably going to be dead the next day see if your AC compressors engaged if it's clicked on and engaged even though it doesn't work it might be turned on when the keys off\nAnd I think when I answered this call on a hotline called it was similar I think I brought up the power train control module instead of the front control module and we had all that uh I wasn't there not being hands\nOn I just do that there was a module that was the other thing on her now and go of although it's a it's a different ... is it different module okay I guess I was wrong her nails that I where are you listening to us in Texas [laughter] for your Texas oh we love sweetwater Texas I'm actually from Texas so I Know I Know where that is that we've got a lot of listeners\nFrom down there it's uh we we appreciate all the interaction from sweetwater thank you for calling\nLike our Facebook page or go to under the hood show dot com go to our Facebook page joining or who the fan club and get in on that drawing who's our winter\nThis week's winner is\nGoing to do with being a sponsor of the NASCAR monster energy series then I found an ex soon any big changes next year could you would you believe me if I told you that they're gonna uncertain tracks changed the paper on the intake of the of the cars reducing the horse power by two hundred horse power\nOn some of the big tracks next year or they leave and then that will restrict or ... ... they're they're changing the the paper on it since they have different horse power they're changing the spoiler they're going to really try to get the car back even further into the hands of the drivers okay a big change is coming so we have to watch next that we are but\nYou know we should we should do to make NASCAR really interesting\nAt random once the cars are already to go on the track like an official goes through and changes the cars\nOn the end [laughter] change it's like\nOkay we've got a random drawing we've\nGot a random drivers which they all got to get that shares and get a different ... in a different car we've got a bucket of restrict\nOr plates they could put Eli usually get it in on it so they could just check out the car in their color scheme or the winter drawn out of our who do you stand up\nIs Roger ... ... okay okay I'll bet you'll know who he is because I probably butchered that name Roger ... from the heart land Minnesota\nCongratulations Roger Portland Minnesota congratulations now let's talk to Justin Justin you're on the end of the old show what can we do for ya\nOh thank you gentlemen for taking my call um this is basically a question and a cautionary tale I remember\n[laughter] I think last week about\nAh the idea of being careful when you started cars been sitting for a while so this is an idea of what can happen I have a Nineteen sixty five Mustang restored it with my dad probably starting Nineteen Ninety six I'm drove through high school\nOr that after the you know starting college you know it doesn't have power steering or power breaks look I was a safe\nVehicle uh drive most of the time I only drove a once a week for maybe a ... or what's now once a year for a car show a this a few weeks ago I was planning on moving it needed to move it I'm Out of our outside shed to another area\nAnd so have the wife out there telling her ears are starting fluid and just try and do I remember my dad doing using starting foot up on the carburetor\nIt wasn't really started I was kinda surprised about that is you start to write up\nI don't like the way this has been going [laughter] yeah that's what a terrible\nDuring a mid crank I I started then it's kind of dying down by the starter stop all the way and started again and it had like a clerk and then now that I'm trained over even wife was saying yeah it sounds much or grinding now you can still hear like turning over by the sound is completely\nDifferent got it and so like I'm trying to figure out now what do I do now I have messed something up or what do I do how do I figure it out\nAbout this was going to be on the last ... first of all I thought no wife when the gone\nI was waiting for a backfire array\nOf lots of starting fluid bathing and the greater yet I I cook got\nHealth insurance for the white man regulate horribly classics insurance to cover the loss of the car\nA while so here's what I think happened as it was cranking you got to a backfire and it and\nThat was a huge load on that starter and either took some teeth off the flywheel or damage the starter and now when you crank it it's got the America Invents act are like instead of the nice moves I don't know\nHow to make a smooth starting zone but\nWell like writing stories you can hear that you ... and tell me they're just like grinding\nAnd you want to stop and is this different sound\nLike that to me it sounds like it's still something is turning over like in the engine but it's almost like it's like something metal sitting inside of it I mean I could\nBe wrong I ... I was just it seems different\nThat would be hard to have happened but again I Would probably if you're concerned like that which it sounds like you are 'cause you called the national radio show a would remove the spark plugs\nAnd turn the engine over by hand by hand\nAnd see if you can feel anything and if you really concerned more scope looking cylinders\nSee what you're seeing 'em maybe she really juice it up with the starting fluid which would be amazing\n'cause you ... you could yeah you could have hydro locked it if she was just porn and then they're like crazy but usually that stuff would\nEvaporate evils that it's very common to damage starters on those you might even just pull the starter off and take a look at it because the ... are really easy to get off of those cars\nTake it off and look at the teeth and see I mean I damaged one of my model the had the spark advanced little too far on it when I was first putting it back together and it uh\nIt backfired and broke the broke the star on the fix that so it it's common we've had them in our shop where we've tried to crank up one cars weren't starting in the back fired when we're trying to get them going in when they backfire Olson the starter changes from one sound to a different did you have a backfire\n[noise] no no I I I was very surprised that it wasn't starting actually I mean normally are sorry for you know you put little but that in there it's going to start right up and I was turning it over a little bit and I was telling her you know don't just hold down the story of or just splits a little bit of time\nAnd I was really surprised that had actually started up because just a week before it had started well enough for me to drive to the to the shed and so\nDo you know is it an engine modified and you saw it at our wide thing happened is the engine modified or is that stock\nOr believe the internal or stock um course has a different carburetor you know it's pretty up with some you know bought shirt off covers things like that but the Basij itself as stock\nCars that enjoy a night that engine should be a free wheeling engine even if a valve got hung up it Ross it shouldn't impact piston I'm that's what just makes me\nI guess I just start from scratch again and and your next step might be to just pull the spark plugs out and turn it over by hand and see if you feel anything and I would discount the starter thing yet because uh\nIt's it's ... it's possible Justin hold on a second I Want to talk about it like you're not really there for a second if this were you Shannon or us and you had to pick your wife to either and you're expecting it just to start right up if you hit the started flowed right would you have your wife in the car trying to start it or would you have are under the hood with started foot\nWouldn't want to do I I have done this before and I usually have her inside cranking while I'm under the hood on an older car working the throttle and the same time so all she has to do is turn the key or I'll just get myself a screwdriver and hit the ... side\nNot a good idea I uh I Would have a crank okay\nYou'd have her in the house while you were under the hood with a screwdriver would\nKnow she'd come on crank ... oh yeah and I didn't I don't have I didn't know they know and it might turn into a why didn't you stop cranking that's Idaho when I hear I hear you I I Am mad you name it ending poorly no matter what\nBut I'd rather have her in their ... ruining it\nWouldn't be my father and and catch on fire so there were a little bit of an art to the spray you know it's a it's a ... and then sometimes you got to get a ... so it is or was there a thought but ... but uh as to who would do what they're just in\nYou know there was the idea is I'm always afraid that you're getting a going by no it might not idle long enough for me to jump in switched places a person's\nHigher itself or speed transmissions all that and get this\nGoing the tires are holding air very well we've got to get this thing moving small\nLittle shed so it's like honey as soon as this thing starts up throw that air cleaner on shoes it's pretty easy threw on put the lid down the down a little bit I'm off to move it really quick that was my whole thought process and she doesn't drive stick shift at\nThe time I guess it\nMakes total sense now that you're saying that way I thought Justin thanks very much for the call 'cause what if it would have gone in my case and well it was what was already going why did you still get a phone neutral and blonde\nWe'll or something I'm all for this car sounds like it'd be perfect classics for sure that'll do it for another hour of the end of the show until next time you can find a sit under the hood showed dot com\nDon't forget to check out the end of the video store and we'll see on Facebook for us Evans Shannon Nordstrom ...

uh MTV Seventy eight or has a [noise] eighty six or a bird turbo in it\nOh oh yeah and in different anyway every line and get the the turbo to work and taking it to a mechanic and he can't figure it out I guess\nThey started works at least the gauge but there's not much of a\nBoost in performance in the vehicle [noise] I'm just wondering are from different things maybe possibly check [noise]\n... have have you driven an eighty six ... turbo coup that was operating properly\nBut I'd like to see the difference\nBecause much lighter of course in eighty six they had some ... to them but they really made a big jump into eighty seven men the following year because they went to a different injection system in a different computer set different dribble and everything I think in eighty seven cars eighty six\nThe gates would go up and they would just go but they didn't like take off like a rocket what the what had happened but\nIt's happening with this is just\nA you know more than something that I it seems to me on those early turtles and I also had a eighty one trans am terrible and they made a lot of noise and they had flashy lights but just didn't give a lot of power no it was kind of\nEighty seven what you accelerate and you could feel that terrible as it started the spool up and it would really go I mean they were they were ...\nI think that's going to be a sneaky electric cars and eighty seven or eighty hundred ... excellent condition\nSo what kind of would you have a boost gauge what are you reading for PSI on\nIt goes up to about seven\nOn us if you've got that and it's actual is an electronic\nNation is seven to ten but I'm Wondering as far as a\nDifferent things that was the same motor they put basic seem set up in an eighty four eighty five Mustang is deal with the two three turbulent they're supposed to get I mean you should be able to feel I Can't remember the rating was but it seems to me it was like\nTwo hundred and fifty horsepower to Seventy two forty somewhere in there it was pretty ... which is by today's standards\nPretty low do you have a mechanical boost gauge on here or is that electronic\nWell it's it's just looks like it's electronic it just is it the fact I've ages look at\nThe gauge and it's just a [noise] when you accelerate it registers it kinda pops into that seven to ten range from the other side of the gate agent so I assume it's\nSo let's so you've kept the gauges out of the Ford and put in there\nWell I bought it from a a friend in Montana and [noise] just trying to to get it to where it should be performed better that's one of the other problem than I Am trying to workout is but it's got a\nFiery speech but it has kind of electric connection to the transmission but then it's going to a GPA of course the dominant so that's not working on either as\nThese effects are our friends the deal to tell me how to our friends the Dakota digital make a box or that you can convert and they\nSell a ton of them yeah so this box is a pretty small if you'd stacked about three ... of cards together it's about that size and on one side of it it's got a ground and an ignition switch wire that go through missions which\nAnd then it has to wires coming in from that electric speed censor or one way or depending on your system from your transmission that you've got 'em at four\nAnd then on the other side it's got your screw on cable that hooks to any kind of ... be you know what the old screw on cable\nScrews on the one into the box and then the electric motor drives it and if the spin amateur wasn't accurate it's adjustable inside you can change the ratio calibration ... so you can get your speed just right on that one I Believe you just drive it like a fifty five push a button on it and it calibrate that for you so it keeps us but I'm a director\nAnd then you've got the best of both worlds you've got the electronic trends but you've got a spin on it or that runs correctly\nI can use with you if\nYou had just go to Dakota digital dot com and you'll find their ... that stuff thanks very much\nAnd it's all going to be on the probably the wherewithal to the that the management or leadership has to stick with it\nTo see if we can get to where it needs to get in what will the next generation of buyers will this be okay with it or they used to paying\nX amount of dollars for their cell phone and ... for a lot of other services that they have in their life will they put their vehicle on that same list\nAnd the higher levels I remember they even had like a service like concierge service where you could say I want to switch today and when you went out from work the right car would be parked in your in your spot\nThat that was what I Would need I think to make that way because I Would I Would go oh I can switch anytime and I don't want to drive all the way over there to switch now\nThey just said that they are in in California where they did their pilots they had little demand\nUm many that signed up canceled after one or two months and they have no plans to discontinue the programs says but they're going to have to alter a little bit mhm uh they've been surprised how few people are genuinely interested in the ... in this type of ownership Robert Parker Lincoln's director of marketing sales and service pulled automotive news in Lincoln ...\nIf you'd asked me a year ago I would've said this is the next big thing a lot of people are struggling and make the math work\nIt seems like for a while there and it it it made me it's just in my selective memory of of a whole condensing a whole\nYear into a smaller amount of time or something but there was a while they were we were talking every week about subscriptions or this company is a driverless car this\nCompany's electric doesn't seem to be that is it because those are just started now and we're seeing what happens it just seems like that stuff is all driverless stuff or did my Facebook algorithm change what no that that I had this\nI saw a drastic drop in the autonomous a type stuff which a lot of the electorate were autonomous stuff that we are the kind of one hand in hand we saw big drop when that when the deaths occurred remember the nickel and ...\nPart of it I I I think a little bit of I think a lot of it has to do with the political climate that's there's all kind of partner together all about the science that allow us to political climate and and that just in general the narrative ... a few years ago was yeah I mean there's ... there's more of a push\nTo say you know what let's get these auto manufactures a chance to develop something with the internal combustion engine let's you know let's look at the raw material differently and that in the news\nThe news changes so fast and we've got so much other garbage to be news stuff right now\nThe man who just who cares about car do I want to do a story on autonomous cars we don't have time we're just doing breaking news this ... hour yeah [laughter] where it is right now what's your feeling alive but if you're an eight six six five nine for for one five oh that's a number you can call twenty four hours a day\nI this is Joe and I've been in Redmond, Oregon\nI've got a few thousand three board has three fifty\nSix leader ... land on bond over forty five miles an hour and I'm just full throttle at a certain position just the whole feed it love just kinda falls on its face but as soon as I wrote my vote on it\nTakes right off rounds real good wondering if you had any ideas on that\nIt could be a or there's tons of things that can do it but it's it sounds like you may be one of the first places we've started looking at our shop would be at the fuel system in that\nBecause if you've got a an issue where it can't provide proper fuel delivery whether it's the actual fuel flow or a problem with the fuel control like an injector or ... or something like that it can give you that lug at a real light\nThrottle but then when you hammer down on it it dumps it in and it goes\nAnd feel flu is an important issue on any diesel and for a lot of folks that go into performance diesel that's one of the things they have to modify\nIs the fuel flowed out of fuel preparation for a different things the fuel system to make sure that they always have\nA solid consistent non ... flow of fuel\nComing into the system and ah sometimes even a a crack in in a fuel filter housing or a can cause problems like this and it's a base issue that can have a result that might turn on some sort of a trouble light or things like that but it's it's more in the uh [noise] I guess the the the general running of the engine\nAnd when it gets underneath that extra pressure and needs to push that air through and bringing the fuel\nYou start reaching the end of that are real quick and you need to make sure that fuel flow is\nIs proper and that's that's where I Would start eight six six five nine for for one five oh\nI get the on from South Dakota ... or an F. one fifty five four and all that long day break but they came to a halt won't watch red does get going again when shipped out there so you didn't have any trouble getting moving ticketed and\nWhat about you go about other uses bad change if you go about old greats and the other two days that it's a little situation and as far as I've been both\nThat's on super fun you know when you think you fix it and it happens again two days later no\nWet well Chris everybody wants to think they fixed it right yeah absolutely they they were going yeah yeah so oh what I did was great all I had to do was unplug it and plug it back in and then it comes back and it's the fleeting feeling of All right I didn't spend any time diagnosing this I was just part darting it\nMhm should I not even he should I'm holding a fused should I really expected to get it fixed that not really there's there's something going on yeah I ... it could\nAnything could happen on those we've seen some of them with water\nThat come in that they've had leaky windshields on them they'd get into the electronics we've ... have problems the fuse boxes with that that's one thing we've seen on we've seen issues with transmission wiring harnesses shorting in those causing issues that both uses and if you replace a fuses and then you still have the issue or worked for a little bit\nWhen they'll shorts occur they can cause problems the transmission control modulate Eighteen year old vehicle how it's going to be this is going to be one that's going to be difficult to diagnose probably when a fused blows how often is it the fuses fault\nI I don't know I've ever seen a few fail and less the fuse had water something on it to cause to corrode okay it just\nCan't think of that to where the connection was bad for the few had fuses ... you put a meter on and still had a\nContinuity through it he was still doing its job it was completing a circuit I remember growing up we we had fuses in our house and we just\nBlown constantly because there was like an upstairs fields [laughter] we had little circuit for what every yeah\nUpstairs downstairs there there was two fuses we're gonna
