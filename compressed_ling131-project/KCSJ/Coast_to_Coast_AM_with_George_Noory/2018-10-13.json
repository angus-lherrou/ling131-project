{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "And so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy strong or something I practice something called modern actresses\nAnd and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd they did accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homeless we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me\nFrom the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say Sean priest\nI don't belong to any particular religion because [noise]\nYou work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong\nTo a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal feelings I wasn't touching anybody anyway is really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes there are already in the homes from time to come into the home the\nSense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's ... maybe a professional habit where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great extra assistant every religion and not the only one\nThat are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well like I called you know a local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have\nContacts with higher spirits are also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow ... do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all\nNo you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on Jeffrey we're at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries

and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems or depression anger issues unhappiness or overconfidence\nAll sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical around and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate death but actually working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power\nSuddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it because it ... the\nDemonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark problems that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits\nTo quit being evil or you know the trip pan turtle like I go to the other side gets\nOff drugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for the spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits\nDemonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirits negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields\nI don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual the safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them George\nI Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ...

I didn't I didn't know when I was dream that it was a dream of a loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all that\nShe has been consuming these drugs we don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in ... in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that we've not open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou don't you're okay where are you a\nUm ... um I had a um a thing you could really believe in a while before I had a I had done a little ... ...\nAnd I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was at a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if the devil we do all this you know and I started reading the Bible and uh\nGoing back to the point when I was out of jail and uh uh as God and I was like ... if you know your eye on everything Israel you know show me was I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I\nIt started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened\nThen I I started seeing in these little things like um with people like a\nBeagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy who had\nThree of them right ... it seemed like everybody and when he had Korean the everything he did he touch with no I mean if everyone like ... ... you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one kid he didn't have none okay now these kids that you know\nNo uh bits of glass of water

traveling I've been enough in Connecticut I was in LA uh on Monday doing some new interviews for ancient aliens really excited\nAbout that you should look this up while you were a year\nWhile he was such a fast track and um so I just there overnight and on a personal note I had a sick cat who passed away\nYesterday so it was really emotionally and are very very difficult time he was my beloved

him to go sadly and I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nHe's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yep absolutely tell me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a wide range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nThat is their mission and along the way they brought with them they're ascension teaching state the the ... are very clear that some of the watchers brought in various crafts and technologies with them that clearly taught humankind how to use various tools and\nAnd other implements but along the way they also\nAnd this was a big beef that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven and the secrets of heaven are how humans and transform into angels\nRide the cosmic conduit and dwell it God's throne and that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels\nYou'd think they would walk in there\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that you cut out the church in the scenario you have no need for the pope send the priest and the whole church establishment because in fact the church doesn't teach\nHuman rights can do it on your own right\nYou can do it on your own and that is the big question can humans\n[noise] take it upon themselves to perfect themselves as the term to become more whole to become more holy to become more complete if you answer no than chase them as demons chase them is giants if you answer yes\nAnd you really you know you're you're getting into the innermost esoteric secrets of the most closely guarded secrets of all human kind the secrets that day whatever government or new world order type authority you subscribe to these are the secrets they do not want you to know about these are the secrets of the aluminum ... ultimately\nWill you mentioned something to is there any evil it all connected with the watchers\nWill there isn't in perception I mean the the the the scenes were absolutely clear in their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by ... Michael is also sometimes referred to as milk he's a duck\nWho is who established the priesthood which Jesus was a member of the other current or force is led by ... who's referred to later as the anti Christ\nAnd they were they were both of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times is is kind of the Christian concept of the devil on your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nIt's an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the other knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from uh several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the renaissance it was a belief was developed that the sheriff and we're actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book uh papers described the the heavenly thrown up God referred to as ... and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this and go ... who are these people ... what did they know how to stay perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I how can I and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise]\nWell I never knew I had my in my garden and I never knew there were aliens on line I don't even live in in my feeling you\n\n\nYou dont need now why do\nYou\nWell you never knew\nYour me when I read in your lead\nIn\n\nMining\nCheese\nDone\nOh he didn't need a lot of things that need to know how how\nCome you\nDidn't come\nFor damned belong to you Tom Dan eyes or Lisa ... who did Sean modest shores Stephanie Smith Chris balls timber with George nap I'm George Norris somewhere out there on coast to coast am we'll see you on our next edition a tool that can\nBe said for every one [noise]\n\n[laughter] Saturday October third James what's new today on the free our radio our heart radio\nFor decorating the house or just letting the scary mood\n... has ... with labor in my lifetime we've\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people ... the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite stations\nThree by radio\nOr why did they get into\n\nBecause they may qualify for free or low income health insurance through medicating share even before you were a kid could still be eligible for doctors and dentists visit prescriptions and more get your kid to cover today\nGo to ensure kids now Don gum recall one eighty seven seven kids now\nMostly in that moment and movie credits that says no animals were harmed in the film director I rely on the decades of experience in Maine brings safeguarding animals that they can\nBe in and play on the U.S embassy soccer team but your money where the miracles are\nGet your children's miracle network hospital\nFive K.

prices have even more and we see every boy and a five dollar G. resort for every one point you rap star card holders aren't going pardoning figure deal smaller prices\nIt certainly believe that we exist and so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author\nIs not caused by demonic spirits negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy shrugged ... I practice something called modern actresses and and that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found\nOut many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so to negative spirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place for carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and sold to minors spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra system deals with the idea that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed\nSomebody like me from\nThe atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent freeze say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clearing so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the whole the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have a clear it out once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAh and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have\nDeep contacts with higher spirits are also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances but the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all\nNo you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for the rest of the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly dot coms book is called power protection will come back and take your calls as well

I have no idea how long had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I have to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep and not working at the at this time I was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion\nAnd actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just sell to looming\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and\nUh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls coming pretty quickly and not only\nImmediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clarinet do these things by Skype\nI work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone or you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our families\nUnder fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained because I'm not getting hit with negative energy for my coworkers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really hard you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinutes already find different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and\nI don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the business or a house\nAnd so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop\nBecause the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy fields both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople who go to school I went to this this is the same school ... elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful but I mean think\nOf the moon energy dinner elated\nAnd so people will be calling on comfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good look like some costs just for you know most all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I

a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness or overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen\nAnd and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that\nDividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate death but actually working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time and I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it\nMe right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it because it ... the demonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark relatives that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm I think of the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to\nQuit being evil or you know a good trip pan sort of like I go to the other side gets\nOff drugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for these spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits\nDemonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirits negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's possessed or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual the safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them George\nI Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kinda stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they\nLove it you know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please\n... you can find everything you want to know about me it's dark clear dot com stark clear dot com it's gotten my Skype address my email addresses my story's a telephone numbers get a hold of me I Do not charged for consultations\nRunner you my church very much money I Do it just to
