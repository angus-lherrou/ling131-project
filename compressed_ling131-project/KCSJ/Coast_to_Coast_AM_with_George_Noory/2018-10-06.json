that it's like they\nDid it on there and they knew better right course\nThey did well one would call me up to date because she always got her her script you know like three days before the new one

show to are also but he didn't uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a um [noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a myth barber stand were standing there\nAnd I I looked at her and my mind would totally blank all I could remember was Victoria bar only from the\nValley yeah exactly and what she was classic actually all while\nShe was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh and ah and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being\nMade now the way the studios were acting and she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake and one of the cameraman said who is that in James mistake of saying some old time movie actor oh no\nOh yeah I'm a you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going\nI literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since\nDead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went into the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people live people she said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it in she went\nIn the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams how\nDo you remember that movie pull two guys in the the little ... little lady kept showing my little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I have no idea I\nI thought that the hip possessed during tricked or some some strange way to get the ... changed your personality or I Know they\nThey turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when go was ... was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and ah the person that will take me around took me into this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house\nAnd sell it turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't\nKnow they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... house he says and and uh and I helped you know work on that\nAnd I looked at him and I sort of squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you\nAnd he looked at me I says why did you put flies in the attic what could that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies have nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that it's like people they just they do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of the I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous million to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest

of empires something\nHere exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or after slaughter bright and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and\nI got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so\nThey they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed seating bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that are in the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them\nIt was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help\nOn the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything and I think that was you know part of what\nPeople were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people and and\nSo I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name police\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I says yep [noise] and she goes we better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the lord and Jesus in my heart\nWould you have these dreams your mind about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it's in me\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody into um where they're going to kill you I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um\nWhen me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nYeah it was weird I

your voice to the to the new year is under way can you believe that um unbelievable yeah have you been um\nI'm very good actually today's my birthday oh happy birthday what a great time to have you with us you know\nI Know no I'm grade I feel really good so the world is pretty pretty insane right now I've noticed\nSeed really seems to be out of control isn't it\nA you know I I just kind of want to say I was listening earlier and I was just wanting to say um [noise] we just need to really mellow out [laughter] [laughter] we really do\nThere is there's just so much a negativity and so much pressure in the culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of mass anxiety and uh maybe that's\nThe the Cairo is a ... a credible opportunity to recalibrate I'm sure that we're now in line with\nThe deep deep blueprints of what it means to be a human being is it a predictor or\nThat question you know that's that's a that's a a a controversial question I don't think so my myself um I I think it's more a reflector\nUm but it it there is you can predict some things but one of the problems with prediction from where I come from is um [noise] see I don't I don't believe that uh the future exists [laughter] um\nI you know I Am a around the president right\nPower now guy yeah right and it's it's all happening now it's all here interesting take yeah the future is a is a construct\nAnd show 'em when we talk about prediction we're looking at possibilities that are happening or in the present moment\nSo and that way it projects\nWhere we talked about the ducks card I learned from you since then that doesn't necessarily mean one is going to die\nI beg to differ I beg to differ you\nYou think now means someone's gonna die\nAbsolutely absolutely because you\nKnow like I always thought it was maybe just a relationship that could be that too but\nYou know what George everybody's going to die yes sooner or later everybody's going to die so of course it means someone's going to die it doesn't say when [laughter]\nSo I remember you once asked me a art you said or if I get the death card does\nThat mean I'm going to die and I said absolutely yes [laughter] and\nThat and then you will liberated but we don't know where\nThat's been but that is true with all the cards in the ...\nWhy would somebody pulled the card if they weren't going to die immediately\n[noise] um well well it's a great question and and my answer is because um as far as the Buddhist say I'm death is certain but at the time of death is our number right\nRight so I'm In in in keeping with say the Tibetan book with a dead the understanding of being aware of the reality of dash\nLiving each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment is a useful way of re calibrating your mind and so it's a part of reality it's nothing to be afraid of\n'em it's not all that pleasant to think about it either but it's just part of the existential reality of being human [noise]\nUm and and all these uh cards most every court in the narrow really though\nDirects you point you to um ... ... spirituality I'm being more ... you know every reading at the end of the day says um\nGet more in touch with your spirituality get more in touch with your consciousness and um be\nMore aware of that now that's what the terror essentially says Everytime\nWell it's an

Still calling myself a paranormal investigator they still have to figure out when people call what the problem I'd\nDo they really have a ghost in the house or do they have bats and the addict you know I had to determine which one it is\nWell generally what is it\nAny more people are really smart between all the radio on the television people pretty much know now they've got activity in their house or not\nYou know years ago they just want her to talk to me because they could tell me what happened when they were a kid and I wouldn't laugh at them but now you know now they they no sense to look for and the other thing too is\nMoms and dads aren't ... kids anymore when they say I'm afraid in the bedroom there's a man in my closet you know parents are finally starting to listen to their children when they are upset about something and kids they know what's going on there are so innocent they can\nSee spirit that crossed over spirit that haven't crossed over normally kids aren't afraid unless the spirit is mean to them\nLike you learn when you were a kid\nExactly that's exactly right so and at least I had grandma to go to and talk to and get a dog you know straight and granted my head\nMost of these kids don't camp that something to fall back on now all they had you know well it must be a cold about it because I saw it on a movie or um I saw him walk through the

an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\n[noise] right and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the left\nHis ... always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the life family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debt debt\nNow can that person one realize this is happening to them in to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember calmer you know be careful who you try to throw under the bus ... you\nNever know what goes around comes around that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know it easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're

information you get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo no no or or if they do they're not passing them on\nExactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show marry him and I want to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were a little girl correct a well were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth bounce spirits the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize that\nWhen I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian [noise] ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket\nBut he was he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung kid who did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did did you always have um like that\n[noise] no I think that the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time and by so\nIt improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me but three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or\nAn airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and it's crazy is the founder our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does that want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is happening\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five\nThirty years ago that happened a goat actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face and and I wouldn't\nHouses if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door you had no idea how loud that was when the yet\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because of all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead and I'm a line I got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab the on throw you into the light it still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man does it look up and go ... Gurley not so much anymore now when I tell them to do something they usually listen but I'm usually older than all of\nThem have you ever have you ever come across Miriam the double\n[noise] I think that I could see him maybe three times or the ones that were so evil that they had come from the\nBlack cool yeah and I\nWould if I ever run across that situation now I really try to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get a hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTo try to get rid of the level or the demon or whatever might be exactly\nThat's exactly right and there are people that say they're demonized images that they can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that\nAnd I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I Would end up leading somewhere I Would get scratched or or look like I was\nBit GE or something and it's like oh no no no no no no no don't have to do this anymore and that again something that I Will refer to in order to preserve\nThat's probably pretty smart we

let them do that it's like\nI did they did it on\nThere and they knew better right course\nThey will love would call me up to date because she always got her her scripts you know like three days before the new one right\nWhen she was good with you she like\nYeah and she would call me up and she'd go you should see what they're having me\nDo oh no no but yeah no and she she knew that it was the first half hour was usually over the top the second half hour\nThey seem to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made it\nTo Dr James van Prague not\nWell no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming what do you mean talking about why not it loves all were earth bumps bears like the ones I saw\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a um [noise]\nA something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a myth barber stand with standing there\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the big\nBallard yeah exactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little clip of us think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm start offering because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd ah and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that\nIn James meets mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah I mean you know rather than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you can do if you went into the light\nAnd she said huh\nAnd I said have you talked to other people live people she said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go the Jewish so rough and talk about it in she went in the light so\nI Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams if\nYou remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady have shown little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possessed or tricked or some some strange way to get the ... changed your personality or should I Know\nThey they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when goes whisper was being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and ah the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore\nHouse he says and and uh and I helped you know we work on that and I looked at him and I sort of squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what could that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies had nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that ... it's like people they just they do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of that I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pains in my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that I had\nNo idea what you're inviting in and it's sad because it's\nUsually teenage girls high school who am I going to go to the problem with who am I going to get married\nTo how many kids are going to have seriously\nThink somebody's going to know that answer well gee we only as to good spirit to come\nNo trends you right exactly and some of these ferrets they came to these girls when they were in high school their forties he's sixteen\nYears old now and

Ross is off this week\nThe end of the who'd shows brought you by O'Reilly auto parts if you need auto parts but can't get to the store just yet had to uh Reilly auto dot com you can buy the parts on

rally auto dot com O'Reilly auto parts better parts better prices everyday\nHere's a call that came in after hours\nThere like that or Texas I live so that's the progress a very excellent show and my question was I have a two thousand seven dodge\nIt's a thirty five ... five live coverage in my air conditioner went out a ... a lot of pressure will not kick on\nAnd off very well heck I'll look into late for the next day when it started trip and the trick is completely that\nI've never had any problems with their color simply for the fact that I've always done before [laughter] but anyhow I could help me out I greatly appreciate it\nWe have had a a friend of ours that we buy palettes from and he had some continuing issues with up around in that same era with the air conditioning and\nI'm not the one that manages a shop like rush those when he's here but I Know that in that particular instance they\nDid some battle with the fact that some of the control for that air conditioning system in that vehicle runs back through the power train control module through the engine computer and so it is it is possible now having said this this is a possibility that with something being\nShortage in the ... in the clutch or something like that that it could be turning on and and uh causing a drain on the on the battery because of that short in the air conditioning compressor so the first thing a person is going to do is give it a physical analysis to see All right\nDo we have refrigerated the system let's just start with the low hanging fruit is the system charged up is the clutch free or or is the clutch itself you know seized up are locked up words it's constantly engaged and\nThen you have to start working your way way back to the electrical system but I Know that was a a challenge for them on that one and so many of the trucks that go down the road\nPulling things or work trucks the the cooling system in the front gets just compromise considerably and if it needs to be considered every time we're going to work on the air conditioning system to make sure I'm covered a lot of basis to make sure that you always have\nAs good of air flows possible through the front of that vehicle because that air through the air flow that comes through the air conditioning condense or is what takes that extremely\nHigh temperature compressed liquid and brings the temperature back down again to bring it through the process\nAnd so you know after it's been through the compressor had there's a lot of heat generated and you need to bring that cooling back down again so uh bent over fins we're we're a good chunk of the front of that thing is is is restricted from air bugs or you know huge amounts of dirt if you've been in a really dirty climate these are all things that have to be considered\nAs you inspect that system so if it is electrical and you get it to work because of the the inspection process and the you know maybe up to replace the cultural compressor or whatever might happen to be\nFind out what caused the stress on the system\nTo make it to make it failed I got ... is there is there a possibility that ... there's a possibility just failed it could just be re route and that's what I'm saying you got to kind of work your way back but make sure you get the things that could have caused exactly anytime you have a failure like that stop from them and say look let's not just fix the failure\nLet's see if there's something in this system that's not normal right before we go ahead and move forward and I think that's important advice eight six six five nine for for one five oh\nYou just gave advice and then call you you've named the advice is good there I don't think you can you you kind of gave the advice and then said that that was important advice that I just gave I don't think that's a I don't think he can do that I just did it [laughter] hey I hit a homerun I have a good I think\nYou're supposed to be I don't think you're supposed to do that was it a humble bragging I like it might have been for the call the outlet everybody else knows that Jim Jim you're on the end of the show what can we do for ya\nHey guys I had a gentleman yesterday he broke down here to Nineteen Ninety four F. three fifty I'm a Chevy man [noise] so\nI was trying to get it to a we just sort of ran out of gas but we figured that out and didn't run out of gas I have no spark\nSo we tested a coil and I had power going into the distributor but I have nothing coming out so I'm guessing it's the module on the side of the distributor\nThat'd be the most logical gas on those forwards it's something that did fail a lot that ... film module and especially with age and he they would break down and they seem to be when they first start going bad it would be under heat they would die and then you let them cool down and they would start again but apparently you didn't have that happen or you would have tried that he\nUh yeah I came by my place and they I was on a highway Seventy seven earn it quit and he just assumed it was out of gas we put gas in and it started back up around for maybe ten seconds later quit again\nSo I thought we weren't getting fuel and then after I Try to push Easter in it and then it didn't have any of that I\nFound ... problem but if you sit and I told him that if I would've had a creator Chevrolet I could have fixed it\nBut if you sit in Nineteen Ninety or Nineteen Ninety four\nNineteen Ninety was a Nineteen Ninety three fifty five pointed gas\nOr one of the state one of the things that I Would check and just because I've experienced this myself is that\nIt ran the power for the engine control system or the early ... system they called it with the they had the ground I Believe run right off the battery and we've seen a couple of different times of their own vehicles were just over time the wiring that came to the battery got corroded\nAnd that smaller wire that comes off the battery was not making a good connection\nAnd you could go up there you could you could wait till that wire and you could get the power to come back to get the spark that 'cause you re power the computer\nOr re power the power system in there it's a it's an early systems I I Would start with the low hanging fruit of checking the connections of the small wires and actually at the battery there and kind of backtrack from there is something I've seen today\nBut it looks like they're going to have to take the distributor out to get a module off but I Can't see any other way to get them to go off don't looks like there's any room to work\nThey've gotta talk back and they're really nice for you yeah [laughter]\nYeah they gotta do Chevrolet and have it fixed by now\nSo well you know everybody's got their favorites [laughter] well thanks for the call Bailey thanks very much are they I think he's on the right track 'cause that was a common failure point of those of those units\nThat's a timely a comment\nThere with just the Ford and the Chevy we've had Facebook conversations of recent\nUh ... words the exact same thing for it and Chevy just back and forth much more good natured than other arguments I've seen lately but I think I think the gym was just make sure he let her but he knew where he should yeah eight six six five nine for for one five oh\nWell most of the systems have a a control of some sort between the switch and the motor and what will always tell people if you've had a motor failure\nIt's always good to look at\nAn apparent you didn't have this problem I ... I should back up the the the blower motor control oftentimes get burned out when a motor goes bad because it builds up resistance in the circuit it builds up heating circuit and it'll feed back to the to the next device which is usually this this control what a lot of times they'll amount\nIn the heat or box on the X is on the exterior but it's in there for for air to blow through it and keep it cool and and the old cars he used to be kind of like a thermostat spring coil that would hang down in there is the resistor and it kind of an old school thing that you'd see and then as they've gotten\nMore advanced with the technology now it's a solid state device that will sit in a similar area a lot of times it's melted under the under the dashing ... on the heater box or near the hitter box but if you can follow that wiring back\nFrom the blower motor you typically find this this next piece and my hunch is that you may have weakened that when you're blower motor went out the first time and it may have just decided to to give up and that may not be giving you your full range of control because you need a full\nTwelve volts to run that is at the high speed you don't have\nTrick which is kind of weird a lot of times they fail out where they they failed and it's worked out and stay on the high handed not the lower speeds 'cause the 'cause the resistor will or the south St device will help control that than don't do it slower speeds so it is a bit opposite that way so there's there they can check that system\nI'd say fairly easily for a technician that's got the the right skills because they're going to look for what what current is getting that blower motor and then they're going to work their way back to circuit and my hunch is they might find the problem right there in the in that border control that's in the inner ear intermediary between the the the switch and the and the motor\nSteve thanks very much for the call good luck let's talk to John John you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\n[noise] ah yeah I got a a Ninety five Chevy course of the car with the uh three one ...\nUm [noise] I mean having issues oh I'd say the last four or five years of the Saddam it are just going on and so on and it'll just over ... gave me doing zero miles an hour just sitting at a stop light and it'll she would always have to like sixty Seventy miles an hour it'll come all the way back down it just sometimes it\nGives you the correct speeding sometimes it just it it goes wherever I Want to I didn't know if that's something with a transmission or\nI've actually came out to nordstroms I about a year ago and has placed the or the desk cost her but that doesn't fix it well\nThe system on that car in the ... of course because they were starting to adapt a little more technology ah I think the some of the previous generation cars in the late seventies early eighties still had a cable going up for the transmission to the ... I mean I one of my old transit just when I drive and I just smiled 'cause you hear this\nAnd it's you used to always have just yeah it's the squeak of this phenomena or cable when they would get dry and all these have to pull him out you'd\nPut oil and him and it was literally a cable that ran from the from down by the transmission up to this prominent but now they've used pulse signals that are set up to be able to make that or to make that go and there is a speed sensor on the transmission and if you had two\nClusters do the same thing that's a good self test to know that you either got a problem with that wiring circuit that plug in or the actual censor itself that's right on the transmission\nAnd you should be able to buy that that a sensor yet I Would think for not a lot of money but if not that might be something you could find that a cell service facility where you could go out and for a few dollars take one off it comes off the end of the transmission where the actual the actual housing part of it is and I believe it has a\nIt has a dual signal on if I remember right on that car and it sends one feed to the engine computer and one seed would still be used for the speed single they hadn't split\nOh yeah that that makes sense because when I plug in ... uh it'll show a vehicle speed\nAnd that won't change from the from the dash\nYeah so I think if you I think if you look at that you're gonna find it's got to outputs on his feet sensor and uh I Would check those circuits and check that censor and you are hoping figure that one out thanks for calling John thanks very much for the call we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back on the end of the uh Joe [noise]\nWe've all had a garden hose gadget that didn't live up to our expectations but we found one that does the brush hero rush era was the ultimate water power detail brush that washes away dirt as its scrubs it spins at a moderate steady speed so it doesn't throw water everywhere and it has a ton of torque\nIt also comes with two interchangeable brush heads perfect for multiple services find out more about brush hero at brush hero dot com that's brush erode dot com [noise]\nWhen\nYou're a battery goes that everything can come to a stop don't take a chance on getting stranded stop by O'Reilly auto parts and get your battery tested free of charge if you're a battery does need to be replaced or Riley auto parts can help you find the execs restarted battery this fits your car or a drug addict guaranteed low price O'Reilly auto parts better ... better prices every day [noise]\n[noise] oh [noise] auto parts\nLike our normal which are used to and it always seems to surprise you even if you know it's coming you kinda every time\nHow long has it been doing this\nWell or just about two weeks I thought he looked for it was something different but no it's just been said in the same\nAnd I got to start with the the the first steps a check to the break fluids levels that's all we're supposed to be\nYup there's no leaks or anything around\nThat's that's always the first step when you're having what feels like a hydraulic or mechanical issue on your breaks I mean even with the analog breaks even with the the newest of systems he's still got to make sure and check that level to make sure something hasn't happened where you've\nHad a fluid last so having that set aside and I'm trying to think on that one time that you've got there is that have the the hydraulic braking system on it or is it a vacuum assist you happen to know\nWhat's a vacuum to assist okay it's got a vacuum can or\nIt's got a vacuum break booster up on the fire wall that you're that that's going to give you that vacuum assisted makes the pedal not seem so hard just as ...\nAs a vacuum coming to a two of those that are hook up and for that yeah there's plenty of vacuum there that should work\nWhen you step on the brakes and bottoms out where we're stopping the vehicle do you ever get nervous that it's not going to stop the vehicle\nWell yes just about because there is just a little bit down there but a voyage just jamming airstrip for a foot to the floor but ah\nWhat do I ... I don't want to stop\nAll right well my my first my first instinct is is that you may have a master's cylinder that's starting to fail that is not what you're describing typically an indication of a problem with like you know people getting deeper with some of the calls we get where they're having\nPesky intermittent problems or breaks that are fading away and different things that we've gotten into some of these newer systems with the unlike breaks you got to be concerned about but this sounds to me like a more traditional\nHydraulic bypass where it's where it's bypassing that hydraulic pressure\nIn the in the master sooner itself possibly you got you know California on the front wheels and I think that oh three you've got you should buy now have ... percent back wheels also not drum break so you can see everything\nSo you know I haven't lost fluids even suspected the lines you are not see anything wrong there\nIf you've got plenty of material on your pads because that will happen to sometimes when the ... the brakes gets so worn down and you can you can get some pretty unusual pedal feel it but they've got to be pretty well worn down for that and I'm going to assume just by how reasonable you talk\nAbout your problem that you've you've probably inspected that also\nSo my my first one which would be that you've got a\nFailure going on are starting to come out with your bright master cylinder which is kind of an old school problem and it's by passing up\nBy jam them on a real hard you know I can stand on the pedal it doesn't go down after that you know like it's slipping by either cups or something yeah\nSo you're you're that makes you wonder about whether that's what it is\n[noise] well we all on ... ... ... just unplug um all that make a difference why\nNo one we were out at a I talk about the few times but we go out to the driving school we've done a couple of times they disconnect or power down the braces things on some of their cars just to show what it's like to do an emergency braking situation without handle outbreaks and yes the hydraulic should work just the same\nA minus the assist of that feature so he pulled the fuse on that it'd be a good way to you could eliminate that from the system but I I really don't think that's where your problem is going to be at I think you're still going to find that problem is somewhere in your\nBreak booster masters cylinder area um you know you could even have a a a booster that's by passing on the inside where an quick hammer it's able to hold but then once you get to a certain point it just it's bleeding by the vacuum inside the you know the big diaphragm inside that booster that could also be it\nUm and so I I still think you're probably going to be at the head of the unit\nUp near the this where everything starts not downstream I ... I really do\nGary thanks very much for the call good luck and\nMaybe stop driving it till you get nervous when he does he's getting in the end of the pedals yeah I I forgot to ask him but he does he have a red warning light on a cause for other listeners out there you're yellow lights are telling you have a ... especially in the newer cars with the modern braking systems\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh what else has caught your attention well it's hard not\nTo watch the news or watch it on your phone to see what's going on in the world and not have noticed the amount of flooding that we've had around the ... and I've seen a number of pictures of vehicles floating down streets cars piled up in piles that have been pushed by water people being rescued\nThe amazing part about this is we've talked about flood things before but you're right now when you say that I Can't think of\nPacific area you're talking about because there were so many so many this we've had we've had the the recent hurricanes in the Carolinas that have been just horrible and uh even in Wisconsin there's been in the early in the season there was parental rains that that are flooded many areas or you know in our locale we've had\nFive six inches of rain it a shot in in a couple of occasions and so I just want to remind everybody\nHow important it is to understand a couple of things about your vehicle and water mhm and most all of the cars now have a air intake system that\nIs that is like a vacuum it it truly is like a vacuum pulling air in it it's pushed area and it pulls it into the intake system of the car but as super super powerful it is it is and so when you go to cross any sort of the intersection where the water is deeper than the bottom part of your bumper\nYou take a risk of splashing up sucking in water and all it takes is a\nHalf a cup of water coming in to it a highly highly tuned engine that doesn't have a lot of clearance anyway if it sucks that through\nYou can kill your engine immediately\nAnd your vehicle will be stranded with you in it out in the middle of the ... with a very expensive repair to come\nAnd most likely what will happen is you'll get stuck out there and then the water will continue to rise and then you will have a flooded car or so you ... you have to heed the warnings and and use that common sense if it's a road that you travel all the time and you know\nThat the boy this doesn't look good or you've seen somebody drive through in a pickup truck that's got taller tires and taller wheels and it's it's up to the middle of their wheels you should not go through that with your with your car or light than any of those things 'cause\nTo me that is that his problem number one is you're going to suck up water with your large vacuum that you're driving and you're going to damage the engine to you're going to kill the engine right out in the middle of the water and and if it's a new event\nDrew a rising water event you're gonna be stuck right there ... now that the next part is the fact that the loss attraction and the floating that happens when you get into too deep water role of a sudden you're drifting off the roadway into\nA ditch next to you that could be a deeper ... um you know the edge of covert I've seen some really bad situations uh with cars that we've picked up as salvaged vehicles and we get to hear a little bit of story from the ... operator Hoover might happen to be some just some really really tough situations that people put themselves into\nMost of the time it's been by choice that they made where they drove that they should not have drove or they should have just stopped and went back and other direction and so it's always good to give that advice\nAnd I deal with this in my job almost you know anytime there's a storm situation that I'm On the radio so we we talk about that stuff all the time and it is I I Want to impress the first part of that because we get into calls all the time were listeners will call and\nThe the standard from the national weather service from emerging services never drive through water\nAnd there are people that will say no I knew that was safer I knew I knew that the road was there wasn't dangerous because the guy went before me or but and then I always go back to that part where if you suck water into your engine the engine is completely done and that's why that's the number one reason not to drive into the water but then yes you do get into those hazard situations\nWhere you can't see what other obstacles might be under the water and it it can be it can be a bad situation and that's when all of a sudden you watch and you see people that\nAre being rescued out of their car because it's they've gotten wrapped in it or you just really got to pay you really got to be wise and I think as a as a whole\nA country we've we've put ourselves in such a hurry all the time we got to be here and got to be there I've I've got to make it here a little pause and think about it and you're stuck in your vehicle and you're here in the middle of an intersection that's growing with water coming up real fast\nYou didn't you don't have time to be stuck there either right and and plus the the dollars of damage that can be done can be budget changing in a hurry because if you suck in water into an engine in it and it comes in fast\nEnough and enough of it what happens inside there is the\nIs the pistons are moving up and down and that water comes it creates a hydro lock and that hydro lock is either going to bend down or break a connecting rod or a valve 'em and these are all deep internal problems in the engine that are in most cases\nThey're repair ... but you're going to replacing the ... right and I I haven't I haven't talked to any insurance can be yet that haven't but I I wouldn't be surprised at some point\nIf an insurance company were to come back to people and seeing their policy that if you chose to drive into a flooded road mhm we may not cover you I'm not saying they've ever done that but I Would not be surprised at some point if that came up you know\nIt's something they would say if you're driving on a perfectly good road and chose to drive into a flooded intersection and killed your car\nWhether they knew you wouldn't want to offer like an extra protection either because you wouldn't want to encourage encourage it so I'm just I really want people to be wise about it and then we get into the subject of okay we've got this flooded car what what happens with it\nIf the vehicle has just had that happen\nWhere it sucks the water in kills the engine\nThe things that are under the hood are designed to be water resistant a kind of like a apple watch or something depend what generation you get there was a big difference between waterproof and water because you get wet yes yeah it it knows it's going to drive down the road and have rainwater snow slush all these things coming up against it\nBut once that level of rainwater\nOr floodwater caused by rainwater or pushed to search for the right or whatever might happen to be a gets high enough where it is starting to intrude into the passenger compartment\nThat's when you start getting more nervous about that car in what's going to happen with it and so people talk about ... you know fixing flood cars new sort of things I've been around a lot of that too and\nMy advice is typically\nSalt water if if you're on the coast listening to us and you've got the the truth the salt water coming from the ocean it gets up inside the vehicle\nMove on insurance companies are typically say move on mhm I I Would not\nI wouldn't fix I've just seen the the only the ugliness for mess with even if you get a really good deal it it's just probably not worth it because that salt water just is so corrosive I mean if you did take the car apart in in in its thruway whatever wiring harnesses the salt water got into it put new ones in\nThe body of the cars going to be fine but it's any of the electronics or any of the wiring any of the systems or any of the unprotected metal for that matter up under the dash under the seats are just be very very cautious with the stuff that salt water has gotten into freshwater\nA lot of that if you clean it will take things apart well dry them out well and follow a good process it can be done but it's not a quick fix it's still a time consuming tedious process that has to be followed all the way down to where the water wasn't before you're going to have a proper repair on that vehicle\nThat'll

Joe you're on the under the ... what can we do for ya\nWell I'll tell you what I got a Pontiac Montana two thousand and when a motorcycle or a large car goes by it sets off the alarm I was wondering if there's any way to turn that sensitivity\nYou've got a two thousand Montana and so the alarm that you're speaking about is on the river bumper to being the only system they might even possibly had right\nWell I don't know whatever the orange long\nYou know be the only that the ... and then it ... yeah the alarm system for for the war in Iraq and okay motorcycle goes by real loud ... Charlie goes by it sets it off in the middle of the night\nThat I had to make sure I was\nThinking so you're not driving I was thinking maybe you're driving down the highway so that may have just sitting there trucker Joe and then these people are either by and you're sure you're not with Frank and ya [laughter]\nNo no I'm Serious I have a large motor alert or are you allowed motorcycle or large allows car goes by yeah it sets off at ... feet four or five times and you can actually Walter shake car and it goes off\nThis is that the two thousand Montana is pretty cutting edge [laughter] I mean it is isn't it that Pontiac Montana was part of the part\nThat I'm positive that the part I'm positive think about though I didn't I didn't realize at the factory alarm had a motion sensor on it in two thousand\nYeah you shake the thing that'll go off or what like I say a motorcycle goes goes off in the middle of the night\nYou were thinking it was just like if the door opens or something out of the you know I just didn't realize that the I truly even sitting here now I Would have to look it up to know if the factory alarm\nHad a motion sensor not are not a shake censor a movement sensor most a lot of your after market alarm systems have that right uh that was always a feature so somebody would start messing with your vehicle it would set the alarm off if if they if they rocked it touched it\nAny of those things and by the way I wasn't a I'm a ... that Montana we had one where I worked in it was so they put it in an absolute cutting edge of the doors and automatic ... and ... yeah\nYeah 'cause they started off with the back of sensors systems there the unborn entertainment in those vehicles a lot of technology now if you go grab directional\nDirections as a a temperature and all that outside temperature\nAnd I'm going to get oil you're out on the west coast I Would have guessed that yours is not rusty like most of them around here there is falling apart and are part of the country you're pretty young I'm\nRight here in Sioux Falls okay All right well we've had a truck or does it always called his\nRecipe on the bottom it's rusty on out I'm like all of them you see\nWell maybe I'm going to have to get another ... to help me because I I'm going to I'm going to go to the end of this call thinking that there was not a motion activated portion of that alarm system ... do you have the owners mail yet\nYes I Do\nIs if you have the owner's manual yet I Would I Would look into that and read that about the alarm system and see if it talks about that and does it have a way to recalibrate well it might be in if not I would take it over if you're in Sioux Falls we've got one of our good friends partner the show audio playground\nI Would I Would drive over there too that crew and have them take a look at it and see just to confirm there is not something else tightened up underneath there that was put into that years ago I'd have to take a look at it 'cause I I just still think there's something been put in that vehicle at some point and I can be totally wrong here\nAnd I think that's the real he's trying to go down as like can I use this long block\nAnd then adapt the components in the top that is not a conversation for everybody sure it's it's it's it's a for people that are really into\nWhat Mary's with what\nThis is a conversation for people you would bring your car to to see if it can be done right [laughter] yeah and and they would probably not want to do it any good racket that you're not going to be able to pay them for the time it would take to do the research and the flag wanted to make it happen\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call the came into the hotline\nHello this is ... and I've got a few thousand sixteen Chevy six points ... the salt and was wondering [noise] on the death fluid on it how hard that is on the motors if you're better off to spend the money to have 'em deleted\nOr what's your guys just thoughts are\nWell thanks for the call and I will I Will start off with\nThis deleting a factory\nClean air emissions device comes with ramifications and Google that we see it in the new there's been there's been a number of companies that have crossed that line to allow tools to let people delete\nDevices and that is typically always going to end up with a\nProbably a federal case against that company at some point if they're going down that road acclaimed probably won't go to jail for it no but somebody else might be right [laughter] right in the company that made the device and so there's a big difference between\nAdjusting parameters and the leading a device uh there's there's adjustments that can be made with in the standards and there is adjustments that take you\nOutside of what was permissible and so you got to be really careful about that the death fluid itself\nIs not it's being injected into the exhaust catalyst to help with the the burning of that it's not it's not something that you\nMixing with your fuel per se and what I've seen with my sister having two of these trucks\nWell she's had more than two she's traded in had a number of these trucks since two thousand eleven when they think it was eleven when they added the deaf into the ... she was one of our first desk calls I Believe yeah and the and the diesel yeah she had her first one was a little problematic handed to fight with a little\nBit but they're able to use that system to get\nBetter overall fuel economy out of it because they can\nRelieve some of the other devices that are re circulating exhaust gas and and doing filtering to clean the air up on the inside because they can create this catalyst effect with the with the diesel exhaust fluid\nOr in a more efficient manner the left the engine breathe better for your but it's at the expense of having that that added\nA process of having to put the deaf flew it in a lot of people don't like it because it can restrict you if you have the run low eventually it can slow you down from sixty five and then down to four miles an hour or if you don't really if you don't keep the system up\nBut it's gotten to be now where it's common place you're it's it's in heavy equipment\nIt's in it's in the trucks it's it's kind of it's became the the more preferred method to get a good clean catalyst affect what does it do I mean we talked about it forever but what is the injection of the diesel exhaust fluid into that catalyst process they're able to create a a more intense and more ... more a\nMore dramatic effect on that exhaust than it would be just re circulating it they're actually adding to it no it's it's similar in nature to what they did back in the early eighties when they would inject air into the gas systems to make the catalyst system more\nA robust by adding the oxygen into the into that a capitalist system and so this case they're actually injecting\nThe euro area to to help enhance that process and they can they can clean more efficiently and quickly or with that type of a process and the words are skipping the exactly what it's what it's called but that is definitely became the more preferred method\nThe reason it was resisted in the beginning I Know international and others in the beginning they tried to stay away from it because they thought just like this customers people aren't gonna want to add this have another tank they have to maintain and another another system that can break\nBut in the end I think they've found that that's how they can get the clean air emissions standard that the government wishes to achieve and maintain fuel economy\nAt the same time without compromising that we're going to take a quick break you're listening to the end
