path\nAnd he uses his whole body legs arms torso\nSteps are about one put four inches is computer vision on the approach they say to hit terrain accurately\nThey call this robot the world's most dynamic humanoid weighs about Seventy five kilos which is about a hundred and sixty five pounds\nBasically what this means that you're seeing the video and if your kids club member you're actually seeing this video\nIs that atlas can shift its weight and it's got eight twenty eight joints has hydraulics built and now the D O D said they're not really sure like one of these robots are not sure if they would never use them in combat but here are some things that I can do right now stand up after falling over\nRun balance on a narrow beam and get this atlas is really good at cleaning vacuuming and sweeping All right I Know what you're thinking\nThat robot has to be cheaper than keeping my wife and other robot taking over the world news here's something that you may be never thought of\nWould it be possible for a self driving car had not just be a self driving car but to use all of this technology be so bad that it can be a WMD a weapon of mass destruction [noise]\nWell research out this past week that autonomous vehicles are a giant security Redskin white hats need to get there before the black hats and do\nIn a closed door a Q A session Ilan most said that fleet wide attack was Tesla's nightmare scenario and announce it they were going to open source their security modules so that all the auto makers could work together for a safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source at all they do a better job at that than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can't even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\n[noise] boy I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of way mo that is Google's self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about way mo because let's do the math together\nHow does Google make its money anybody yes you in the Ford truck they make a huge chunk of change off of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with the self driving taxi\nDo you see the future yet do you envision how it's going to we're All right let's say you go to Google and you search for I don't know fresh Christmas tree up pops in ad for a place five miles away too far to walk too far to carry a tree or on your back but wait\nWhat do you see that Google Search you see an ad click here to had way mo give you a free ride to get your Christmas tree\nSo hypothetically we could start seeing promoted rides for free in place so different search ads on Google\nNow way most of this past week it's self driving cars had ten million miles of experience on public roads and just glad there isn't a self driving car run by Microsoft because every day we hear about some crash crazy stuff\n[noise] and finally as of July twenty ninth team in certain parts of the world all electric cars will need to make a low speed noise by law\nYou see these electric cars are just too quiet right now people can't hear the cars and they're just too many accidents and from twenty twenty on they have to be retrofitted with sound generators you\nSee with no engine sounded all road safety groups they're calling them silent killers and they said they put the lives of kid elderly blind the death\nHeadphone where's textures are in jeopardy so we got a hold here I became committed from a brand new sound is going to be heard when a lead trick car goes by now I Want you to hear it it's going to be the sound and of a ticket or car it has a fancy name\nIt's called the audible vehicle alert system now the sound can be heard and speeds up to twelve miles per hour\nThis before I play the north and tell you a little bit more about\nThe noise is four years in the making\nAnd it was designed specifically to be audible by ... organs but not heard by anybody inside the car\nAnd this is funny that first the technicians developed as down that was like they say a size five space craft but they had to shelve it because people when the car was driving by they would look up in the sky rather than at the road so back to the labs they when they came up with a brand new sound\nAnd if the minute former speaker located behind the front and grilled since we heard in every direction so let's take a listen to the sound that the brand new electric jaguars going to make in your neighborhood\nOh that's it you know\n\nSo as the electric cars going by that's the sound that that the that the researchers say that doesn't sound like a size five space craft or what do you think Andrew you're ready for that\nWhy don't they just make it sound like a car like a V. eight [laughter] [laughter] they're gonna use that one yeah yeah you know what you just can't beat the sound of the eighth or bigger race but I mean here we are we're it's\nStill sounds like a spacecraft to make it look enough where's that where's

welcome thank you what's going on um well a little confused\nUm we're traveling to Europe next month okay um my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\nG. P. N. app so and I'm using public why and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry I thought it was good his fat differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on the public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay so if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever may be is that anybody can just pluck that we're\nSo ... and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that is going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us was traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out OK okay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app\nIs that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun Oh yes I Can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this was like the coolest thing they're going to totally love this to mind when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pickled daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the ... most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right quick song and you know if you could do a food toward any of these that it's been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a comment that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go to your credit cards that you're going I

do have different options there's one side or that you\nDidn't mention is that it's called the ds for off and that's D.

or Andrew and I discuss various topics of high intellect in value\nAnd I preface that by saying Andrew wants to talk about well Andrew wants to talk about I did I say Hi intellect and value did OK I'm wants to talk about Kanye West\nYes but it's more of the tax side of the Kanye West okay we're we're not getting into politics\nNot at all at all love 'em hate him whatever who cares but the Internet was reacting to Conyers phone\nFirst of all we learn Kanye West uses a cell phone because he took out that phone and it's an iPhone and the unlocked it to show the price of the United states uh gifts okay when he unlocked that he was on camera\nSo everybody got his pass code correct okay can you guess what is ... let me give you a hint very\nSimilar to yours well you know I have I saw that them alert to you okay I saw that headline that they pass code was\nZero zero zero zero zero zero correct six zero which you know that used to be\n[laughter] until ... when did you change it this morning I saw the blind [laughter] and\nSo now it's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one close seven seven seven seven seven seven that's far from the zero zero right much harder the other thing that the Internet was criticizing calling us for tech wise\nWas that he had his phone in a case yeah I was the big deal about that it's not cool it's no longer cool to have your smartphone in a case\nSo who's saying that it's not a cooler these people that are ... are they like trust fund kid that are being 'cause those of us that have to shell out ... you know a hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I don't want it to shatter if I drop and the criticism is is that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need\nThe case on the back unless you have a mold for you that's gonna charge you had there is no reason to have a case well that's what the Internet\nWas attacking other stupid okay here's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty good minds pink my black okay but the reason why it's paying it so that when I throw it into my black per se\nI can find so that's why if you got when like me I have a rose gold iPhone it'd be easy to find in my purse\nFew I guy with a rose gold following the only I for some and blows bad case on anyway what does it\nMatter so we were talking about communist password yes zero zero zero zero zero zero there was a call for everyone to try and hack his social media accounts so they wanted to use\nEmail addresses and log in and then just try the password password one two three because odds are that's what his passport is so then came out the stories about horrible past for us to have and I learned something which surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter]\nI've never heard about password walking\nYou never heard a password walking never that's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter and your password\nMost popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are good at the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across ...\nAnd then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to cage two rows they'll go down three\nRight back to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is the first two rows\nAnd let me tell you something if you weren't just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass what exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords I'm Still do it I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\n... what was your or second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's why I Hope to choose to have verification is so great\nEspecially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... and only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password 'cause it's been six months and they used it\nBut if I have an Yahoo apple on my phone they send me a message through the app and I can get in yeah and that's really the off yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we always get people who complain and go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nI'm going to tell you something now my space and linked in yes they bowls since two thousand and sixteen if I've huge security breach\nOr you know in their website ... can you guys in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used in the morning and\nThis is really a tough one I don't know these two stories were connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde hair [laughter]\nMy space and linked in yeah just use it as their password but what's that Mustang that's probably the these are brands of so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy\nOr then our next command on demand that we put out this week is about the deceptive technologies that are being used to fool your senses and why businesses and celebrities like Sharon ... pep boys or abandon Facebook\nAnd what you need to know about Facebook's controversial new posting guidelines for businesses and also for fake news and then of course we had the golden age of radio some of the most popular programs from the thirties forties and fifties we have a some history attack some great podcast tech news today tech news this week you can\nGet all of our podcast on Apple's pod cast on Google clay or get your podcasts or head over to our website over at pot net dot com once again that's ... net dot com and back to the phones we go with Tom in Peoria, Illinois hello there\nThomas hello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I have had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that ... something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go there look they're an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay that we'd babysit our grandchildren\nFor the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer the shit here's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday surfing act\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site a there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available I see\nIf you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yeah so we used to fly you shutter flies at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that a huge these but you know making photo books as a singer weather on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book do yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word bank called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kinda fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so in the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us okay\nOkay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note\nThrough the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your question things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content at for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be\nOver a commander dot com or you could just call it give us a call to the show and fewer kids club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join comes club right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what the Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the Kim commando show [noise]\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on line intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have the freedom to be another on traceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it\nAnd I recommend F secure freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they have the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nF secure even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount go camp visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp\nThey October more than once a day on the ... radio a radio\nA perfect for decorating the house or just setting the dairy mood [laughter]\nOur inspired me play let your tracks with labor in my lifetime we've got about everyone's talking about like maybe it'd be more modest balk at him and Joe Rogan experience all your music all your favorite\nBut my id KPSK dot com [noise]\nI are the forces and brought to buy be prepared dot com slash cam you're one step solution for emergency food water gear and resources visit and\nBe prepared dot com slash Kim and be ready for anything once again that's be prepared dot com slash cab [noise] All right there about nine million Web cams and security cams that are just wide open to attack\nAnd I want you to make sure that yours is not on the list a there's a company called ... among guy\nThat's all that the company who makes all these Web devices and security cameras but guess what\nThat's not going to me the name on the Web cam or their security can because they make tons of Web cam for all kinds of companies but basically what's happening is that these Web cams and security cams are so accessible that if you change in the fall password\nSomebody can still break him and if you want to see if your Web cam security cameras on the list it over to commanded outcome of course that's K.

take it to the picture and then make it appear three D. whatever you post on Facebook now beginning to roll out to everyone uh allowing you they said to brings seems to like oh you do to take a photo

Amazon Prime member gets you don't want to miss this back to the phones we go with a let's see him in young ville Louisiana\nTim hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question about yeah my question it's a ... to ... all along reputation management mhm I guess not let's let's be like what would be the best oh yeah that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it those old or a I'm a software that you ... and then the F yelled at such an optimization ethical would all all\nLittle bit so so what's going on with your business on line\nWell the problem now than what some of it but it's obviously what most of us have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bed ridden balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have the experience is usually doesn't go online and put both the\nPositive experiences with you at your business [noise] so what I'm up here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses so what I Need to do it by something for someone to neutralize the negative responses that's happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any\nReputation type management farm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right\n[noise] right and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp\nOr where where is it but I'm Glad for all the\nMedical it's like ... grade a car okay all the eggs that'll\nGet so OK you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nPhil anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they you know can you up on line and\nJust drop some wrapping up there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it and what I have\nHeard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program\nCalled recognize Dr status and that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo so in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn\nWhat it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google
