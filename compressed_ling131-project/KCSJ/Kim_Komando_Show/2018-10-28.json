Alexa show me the weather and if you wear the smart glasses backwards they can read your mind I write maybe not\nAll right I ran across this next story over at the New York times I\nThink about this data collection speaking of technology how much do you think your personal data is worth I mean everything that you do every website that you visited everywhere you go the TV shows that you watch the products that you buy it's all fair game for advertisers\nNow even when you take the kids temperatures listen to this this flu season Clorox paid kittens are\nIt's a tech startup that sells Internet connected thermometers now these aren't the Mummers we used to have his kids like you know mercury glass thermometers\nThis smart through our daughter will sync up with a smartphone app that allows you to track fevers and symptoms okay get this\nThe data shows Clorox which ZIP codes around the country have increases in fevers\nClorox then directs more advertisement to those areas assuming that house oh they're going to be the market for products like what do you think this infecting wipes yes you follow me Kansas says they have sold more than five hundred thousands thermometers\nAnd the

compensation small businesses are they're paid users will be eligible for twenty five percent refund for any fees paid during that time\nSo here's the deal I was going to pay up to eighty five million dollars to settle this class action lawsuit that includes fifty million for compensation for up to two hundred million affected folks plus another thirty five million for the lawyers and so the lawyers are getting thirty five million\nOr the ... million effective users are getting five hundred million so uh to the lawyers that means millions to you is probably worth about a hundred bucks and

hour but first back to the phones and go with Gary or primary Greg in Beaumont, Texas either\n... have a well what a ... or ... thank you for it's an honor to talk to my friend the digital got his work trends right oh ... ... email you know that [laughter] ... let me run the little the little briefing Europe seven years old okay I have\nTwins Tony or ... years old a boy and a girl ... they're not your typical little in the ... ah they're both going to college studying nursing great I Wish I was forced to retire in two thousand fourteen pseudo heart issue at\nAll Social Security but I Do a little bit quirky little set a couple of things and they told me\nA lucky does have they got Thirteen inch but the pros that they had just two thousand twelve they use them all through high school and now they're trying to use ... in college [laughter] they definitely need upgrading real bad yeah and I figured I Would call the expert\nTo see what I can do to upgrade computers and spend a lot of money\n[noise] um boy there six years old huh\nYes [noise] and the kids are twenty isn't there they're they're terrific kids you have no idea about which all kids look up to like well I'm so blessed you know what it is because I had a great upbringing you know\nI I think I Know I I Believe that I Do believe that um [noise] alright heres deal or there's really not a lot\nYou can do because the six year old process or especially with today's video streaming and programs in games and everything else that they might be doing is still a six year old process or write\nA day and the good\nNews is that there is any good news is that the next week a on the thirtieth of October I mentioned briefly during the news segment at the beginning of this\nHour isn't it yeah is that apple is set to release a Mac will care for okay they say under a thousand dollars but\nYou know the prices any no yes exactly like a ... yeah I Know I hate when people do that it's like under a thousand dollars a lot to say yes it's nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars right a little tough and so you know and your other options that you look at refer a\nAnd so if you go over to apple dot com and you have to actually ... to the bottom of the page Gregg and then there's an option and the second columnist says refurbished and clearance\nIs that you I think you might be able to start looking and you know you look this weekend but you know as more people are buying the newer stuff they're going to be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever it may be and so what I live with you by refer golfer apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this Mac book released and then if the screen has to be replaced they do that it also still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nAnd so you still have that but it's still gonna be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen hundred bucks\nOh sheesh living it let me ask you questions I talked to a guy at will the apple stores here a little while back and he was talking about putting a fish is ask Dr in or something\nOh man you don't want to miss because it's about ... employees getting chipped implanted and then we talked a little bit about it the news block at the top of the hour but you\nKnow towards a frightening Nineteen eighty four society big brother they warned us about this but people are now in betting RFID chips right into their bodies and we're talking to some employers and some people who actually had it done talking about bio ... so we talk about how to add another pod

really have commando in it where I liked the alliteration a pod net dot com okay so so I talk about it in this podcast about how much I paid for a pod net not caught now you've known me for many years you know that I'm\nFrugal [noise] 'kay um\nMesh most you use that word I'm going to say three thousand five hundred dollars\nHigher twelve grand\nYou don't have to listen to the podcast because you're not going to give me an answer for grants to much you have to listen to command on demand I Know and so again we do to combat on demand\nEvery week the other one's about buying and selling a domain

it but basically it's too many of the things you've been saying regarding antennas\nUm type of antennas well we've got four TVs and I think if we had it indoors than I was at one for each one like yes\nUm and I was doing so much advertising now I'm a big baseball fan and watching the playoffs at the ah the advertisements rather than political the court has been um have been about YouTube TV and I was wondering what\nWhat the difference might be between acquiring YouTube versus streaming service\nAnd there's tons of them right get so confusing you're like what the heck should I which I should I sign up for all right so\nI Know that in real cool you got little ...\nAnd then got chrome gas and that was on fire oh I'm so what's the baseball team you like\n...\nOf course we knew that so to for
