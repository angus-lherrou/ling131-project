imagine\nFor a moment that you can get a warning that you were going to have a heart attack years before the event ever occurred that's right well\nThanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hearts scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans tell a doctor when an artery has already\nBecome narrowed by plaque well that's the problem\nThey say now that they can figure this out even before develop they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries are inflamed\nAnd what's

[laughter] okay [noise]\nI actually thought that was funny [noise]\nAll right this next story is not for the kids so if you have kids that are listening to the Kim commando show time for them to cover their ears or you wanna mute the television if you're watching the game commando show there mute the radio if they're in the room as long as they're clear we're good to go or at your ready\nGood there's a dark side of technology that a lot of folks are brushing off is the use of robots for use in how do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a poll dams and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is legal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with the company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right\n[noise] they wanted to open a love dollars brothel and a huge soon so that people would be able to use it\nHuman like dolls a kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie west world Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visiting location and they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits [noise]\nSo Houston's city council actually updated the local audience to specifically banned individuals from having sex with a device that resembles a human being [noise]\nOkay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the Kim commando show a we have come up with the perfect name\nFor that how about a Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck yes okay [noise] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise\nAn average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies and the year two thousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers\nThe studies show that men account for seven of the ... fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all self the death so here's what's going on\nLegislation politicians are getting together and coming up with no selfie zones so it's right to say\nYou're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building a U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nA a tie woman was hit and killed by a train this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the real tracks\nBritish woman Louis she's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach wall so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we may see that's it\nBut if you think about it on a positive way at least they had a refund had shot for the funeral mhm\nAnd finally be careful what you search for online we were talking about this before the show\nBecause I read the headline and it said ruby rose is the most dangerous celebrity to search

not the best idea okay I was a dummy\n[laughter] okay and you are still using their password that that if I were with you I Would just like you know slap you right across the face for doing that because you need to stop using their password okay\nNow what ... what's happening in is that these uh hackers are getting hold a username and password and then they are crafting these emails in in a classic sex extortion scam\nOr you don't want to pay them they really won't go much further than this they may send you another email but don't feel beholden to actually give them any type of

next Google update is one that you might want to pass along to your family members and friends who say they've been working on a brand new product that lets Android users control their device using only their voice\nIt's been a beta a really long time two years but this past week Google started releasing the global aids called voice access allows you to write text\nTalk to the Google Assistant navigate using your voice oh so you can click buttons and other things just with your boys\nOne's voice access is activated you see numbers next to everything so if you want to issue a command you'd

before it's too late and then later on\nThis hour the things that you should not be even thinking about buying as far as technology goes in the month of October but back to the phones me go with Nick in ... Washington [noise] either Nick\nHow are you I'm good what's going on [noise] um\nI've been looking into some money making apple um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are maybe inviting trouble phone ... possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA\nLiving you know on a book extra months\nOf ... so it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars were you know two thousand dollars or anything like that or a you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is the one that let you watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I pull this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion ... that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right um 'cause I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to Costco came up and says hey you know we have a task Rio and so I figured you know what\nMight as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right\nAnd so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Cosco so I took a picture and sent it off through the app and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one's called folk\n... pie that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way\nThere's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business [noise] uh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit there's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right\nI ... you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff\nAnd but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks their sweat coin okay for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coined that will be translated into like an apple gift card their surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate money making apps over my website does that help you out\nTo cook or someone to feel it\nOh it does and then when you and like most people nobody reads the terms and conditions on any of this stuff so

happy apple surgery and Google's assist ... using the sounds of birds chirping\nManipulated in a way that only the microphone on your smart speaker or your smartphone can pick up an attack can bypass detection from the human ears and then start causing havoc\n[noise] so the researchers say that the attacks you psycho Cusick hiding to master true intentions and so this bird chirping or something that is some audible could be hidden inside of commercial that plays on television or the radio and had thousands of targets that was\nAll right so you're like okay well it hasn't happened yet but when it happens how to protect myself well there aren't a lot of security settings and smart speakers that the problem I mean you put a pin on your Alexa or or you can just turn it off we're not using it but the researchers say that this is possible and they fully expected that happen within the near future\nAnd speaking of attacks\nIt seems like anyone who I meet they always want to tell me how

security crazy story that I have to tell you about how voice\nFishing scams are getting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this [noise] ...\nBags and a small Portland credit union last week he got a call himself from it from an eight hundred number\nThat matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession he didn't answer the first two he's let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer [noise]\nSo he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio\nMade to his debit ATM card [noise]\nShe then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I'm going to replace him card immediately about travel out of state California\nWell the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California or those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California ... not a problem\nAny charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\nOr to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably do me a favor\n[noise] she said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up or just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect shouldn't is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother's maiden yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit code printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seem ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply\nSame PIN number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you\nOh can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have\nRight now and he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account so what the scammer had\nWas every single thing about him\nExcept for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had and duplicate of the card she had been number she had everything in\nFront of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhere would they get all the information that is our dog when it's on the dark Web crazy stuff don't do any banking on the phone [laughter] ... the bank calls don't dancers yo green color green color hang up and go to the bank\nThat's it [noise] ah Chaz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin chess\n[noise] has thank you for taking my call how are you
