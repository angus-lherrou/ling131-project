world continue to doubt but now that he's being told by Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalists can knock a shaggy inside the consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Saudi Arabia's foreign minister is defending the kingdom\nIs within a designated patrolling area\nNight scope or the makers of the robot they say that the data secure and it's only seen by the security controlling the robot\nThey're able to stop it and tell us what to look for but nice scape says they can't follow a specific person [laughter] yeah right okay the company says it caused between six dollars and twelve dollars an hour for the new robot to hit the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I gave us thirty minutes before someone knocks it over and then just stripped down for parts\n[noise] or when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible to them that's right\nAnd twenty six Tina drone came within two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX but what if that collusion has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division and he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer that he arrived at isn't very reassuring his group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of a moonie and twenty plane and then uh\nRhone it was a DJ I Phantom to quad copped urge to point one pounds and then he had the biggest their cat in his lab could\nActually handle so the phantom wasn't certain does forty foot cannon released at a speed of two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like us food through chocolate moose than if you're a

what's going on well wait wait wait willow use it and I talk to you again so you've been a caller before\nA long time ago I did a long time listener but I'm a ... called the number\nOh well thank you Jim I appreciate that appreciate that\nI listen to every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good way to either [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but you didn't\nI didn't have an acquaintance too recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a marriage when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born she reconnected and the people and his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she would I could buy a no avail us failed miserably\nOh hey man saying wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years old okay All right so she's Twenty years old\nAnd that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um you couldn't really\nFind anything about her like on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a Facebook account that looked like it had the origin or January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social media no not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend more about her or are you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or whatever\nAll of the above okay uh she does for for money or they're not rich by any means uh uh the the family just to spend a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nI'm sure and then all of a sudden you have kids coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I I'm\nJust a body standard all the [noise] well\nHere are good friend I mean you're worried about right and you want to make sure I was\nI was concerned and at least so uh I don't like she anybody get hurt\nA ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in a different sites for getting people up but I used to ... dot com yeah his book to go up and um come up with nothing\nYou know there's also family trained now\nWhere okay you\nMight be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer glass of wine okay ... click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to check but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out\nThere yeah I don't think he wants anybody ... thinks oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know [noise] why\nYou have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that\nShe is his daughter and I don't\nThink she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get what she can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she ask for money so that this way you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember or it sounds like he's probably not even gonna tally and now that I think about that\nIncluding emergency power light water

that if you wanted to you know paper one there are the ones out there but I couldn't find the other ones that you might recommend well here's the good\nOh no I was gonna say you know so here's the deal is it you know he ... the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\n[noise] I mean that's sort of issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending on the carriers of rising ... do you know who the carrier is a\n... to ... okay if the mobile has it to 'em because he's probably play paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if he paid for the kids phone okay\nIs that the carriers they also they have something like family located or packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier is that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at\nAn okay and if the if he had you know his grandparents\nWhere he won even in normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nOr a you know and you know there's also glimpse\nWhich is also something you might want to look at that but not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y. M. P. S. glimpse and Clinton glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the team of a Web site looked at their family locate or\nLike I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his mom\nThen everybody's close by and he can see exactly in paying somebody and if not look at that glimpse program deck limp sap rather because I think that'll do the trick to and thanks for your

Google Maps on Iowa west and Android [noise] alright\nRan across an interesting story over the wall Street Journal this past week and the title was you want twenty first ... for handing me a muffin the awkward\nAdvocate of I had ... and I don't\nKnow if you've noticed it but I certainly have that wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their eye pad or on their phone is that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it's on but I\nDon't want to name a possible I don't out impossible sponsor a future sponsor so I'll just say there's a place is called bone marrow bread\n[laughter] I'm Talking in code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazingly\nDelicious food yes did the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had booked every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that has just standing there at the register\nSo big cubs a bone marrow I developed the seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you but if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do\nThat though if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay\nI'd a farmer's market I bought spinach pasta was twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip\nOf course not okay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is her business and what I Love about in the call is she treats her station like it is a business so she's professional sheets on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen\nAnd and for somebody her age to have this type of business at command has something she uses square\nAnd to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call which is really the goal of all businesses that people have more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so you know you're married and you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know\nAnd the you know and they're trying to get a they need a new you know they're getting ready for college and they're cheekbones looking really hungry [laughter] whatever it may be I said seriously\nResearch has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nAnd see if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty percent\nBut she isn't that different though because of that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut it's the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on the screen\nSo when you're up a narrow do you tip yeah really I Do that where they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I worked at Houlahan which is a bar like Houston right and and when you wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at ASU\nAt a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register\nNo of course you want but and bad but at ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in\nAnd said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nHow are you lived there were a beach in California that's just south of half moon bay\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe the low seventies um but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nNow let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband how just because we have to\nThat's it and they uh they retired\nThey sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is how big the bus\nForty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you guys\nBut just what everybody has the picture and um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are or right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we're in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's an adventure in what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator\nAirbus and if your guest decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there\nSo we didn't get systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there are kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard a was that we have to take out the side when does it take off\nAnd pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was it that was it off it\nWas it was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] nice [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question and then I bet you you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah basically what happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early days ventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see but we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. G. P. site which is a file transfer sight\nOf that we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and drag that twenty two gig radio uh back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital\nUh we decided to call the gym commandos show so here you go\nAnd so so what this is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and the money to gig cats huge it's really a huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nYeah but then you can delete it\nYou want to you or you can protect it yeah you protecting put in on a you know with a um a private you are oh\nOh okay so that if somebody is searching for you know how big adventure which we all\nI mean All right\nThat they do that has big adventures doesn't quite come up well totally miss you guys\n[laughter] well we wish you do it's a very much for pleasure glad to talk to you today yeah\nNearly break up the files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're going to do years three of Hal in Jackie on the road because if you're an RV or\nThey have a lot of lessons that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends stay right where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life\nParents teachers dentists and all these different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't emotional issues worn out toothbrushes to boot\nSo let me introduce you to quit clip is electric it's small light and sleek\nThere was a built in two minute timer that pollsters every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quit\nNew brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTry quit and see whites backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quit starts to twenty five dollars bats it\nDoes it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.
