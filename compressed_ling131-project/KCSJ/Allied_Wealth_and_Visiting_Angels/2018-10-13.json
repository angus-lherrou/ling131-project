shows in the U.S for seniors and we always have a son show for you and this weekend is no different and we're going to be talking with some great friends from Humanae brandy Johnson and also Sean modest and we're going to take a look at a\nAt some of the some of the programs that they offer at human welcome nice to have you brandy and Sean thank you thank you will ...\nWill thanks for taking the time to to uh to come along you know I'm One of the things that are um I don't know too much about and I've seen Humanae I just really excited about learning more about what he meant it does\nAnd I know that you're both based out of ...\nThat'll springs but you serve a larger area so tell us a little bit of humanity and that how how you function the in this in this area\nAll right so Humanae is a complete Medicare company we also um [noise] are so Brandi and I are both full service eight years so we cover all products\nSo that's where we come in and we actually live here in public Colorado and we branch out so we were technically work from home\nOr work I Hope they're okay with the home office get up in the springs to cover that larger that larger peace\nCorrect yeah so you man has been in business for over fifty years ah they started out in the\nNursing home business they kinda branched out purchased hospitals kinda got through that side of it and started working into the Medicare realm\nOr that allowed them to start out getting Medicare Advantage Medicare supplements prescription drug plans and then they brought us agents in where we actually do the whole spectrum you know life health annuities everything\nYeah I didn't I didn't know how large this spectrum really was so brainy what uh so what kinds of products are you do you handle specifically amount or do you kind of handle everything\nWell we we handle everything actually and we are full service insurance agents with Humanae that's what we call ourselves and on our business cards and you'll see it and it says\nUm service agent or sales agent we're not here just to sell people things were actually here to\nEducate people on health and wellness humanity is a health and wellness company a lot of people don't realize that either so we offer a lot of different programs that are not just Medicare and not just dental and vision not just life insurance but we also try to educate our community as well\n[noise] well that's that's really important part of the show it's really educating our listeners\nTo what's out there but one of the things that that I think when I look at this topic is is that we don't plant enough um if you're a senior in your aging or your son or daughter oftentimes we don't react like we should until there's an issue and then you wonder well I should have known about that or I should have done that earlier\nAnd so is that something that you both run into a lot when you're talking to families about uh any one of these issues is is it really bringing people up to speed and letting them know that now's the time to do this um how does it work for you\nSure um we have we had a lot of confusion especially when we say the N word Medicare yeah of course and\nA lot of people aren't sure what to do so that's what we're here for in the community to educate and and start planning for if you're sixty you you need to think about when you're turning sixty five you needed to start thinking about those things now what's going to be available for you and what are your options going to be\nYeah you want to make sure if you're a veteran you have if you're a veteran benefits or you want to make sure and how that last or I guess you could say the last quarter of your life is going to play out um unfortunately we do run into where we're doing\nA life meeting and nobody looked at their life insurance plan for Twenty years ago I got one no big deal will Hoosier beneficiaries pulled the poll the plans outlook Adam unfortunately make sure that they're not to you know accidental plans 'cause we run into at all the time were accidental\nInsurance plan accidental you know I don't see that made it gave me this years ago and I want to have it now\nYeah it's an accidental death so that we're OK yeah sorry they they actually have two accidental death policies where they don't pay out unless you die from an accidental death right where you know they're thinking they had life insurance and as soon as you know mom or dad passed where we're going to be able to help pay for this funeral or what ever happened\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't so we always do a review and we make sure we tell everybody pull it out at least every five years make sure you're beneficiaries are where you are\nMake sure nobody has any cognitive issues where they can't make any decisions anymore we need to change those beneficiaries we yeah we do all that and then well so do the Medicare review to where we\nOkay do you have your everything's set where you need to get your Medicare\nWow so red when you go in a unit appointment um do you have you have so many umbrellas here we're talking about I mean this is there's a lot of different facets that\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think you know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met is no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have\nI Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable ... can you what have you explain kind of where we position is in our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at and very they're very in price too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage\nAnd I think brandy can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more on that side\nAnd with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lotta people\nThat we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nAh we kind of think about it as that Sean does it really well the combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical\nTheir prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know and this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man of brandy Johnson and Sean modest and uh and I would I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at\nI'm actually on our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number seven one nine to three eight\nSix three five five and Sean's is seven one nine to three seven four or five one night\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming next I mean we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah just because you're gonna see things coming that we don't see how that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is Shaun how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think ... affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're gone\nNow and I bet you if we made a phone call they'd probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retire and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go that's where you could say brandy and I are your age are person because we can help direct even I I'm a big believer even if he didn't pick Humanae at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy and the guy just so I think this is a great discussion and uh hey we're going to ... uh come back and just a few moments
