showed America so we're glad that you're with us and today we're going to be talking about something very interesting and uh\nUh typically when we age we sometimes withdraw from the things that we love and we think we're no longer useful\nAnd I got a special guest it's going to tell you otherwise and so there are great opportunities out there we used to justice and who's a coach for entrepreneurs source is with us and we're going to talk about if you're a senior there are some great opportunities to continue to understand who you are\nWhat you are and make sure that you could be out and do something exciting good morning Lisa great to have you on the show\nGood morning David I'm so excited to be here good to have you here and I think this topic is just wonderful for us and and uh hey I'm sixty one hey I'm I'm thirty four or we go\nAnd uh we're the kind of aging folks that are that need to listen to the store so\nWe'll good let's let's find out a little bit more about what you do and then we'll talk about how our listeners can relate\nTo what it is you specialize in absolutely I'm an alternative career coach I'm with the entrepreneurs source there from that's thirty four years old with coaches located across North America and I have an office here in southern Colorado in Pueblo and I work with people locally including in Colorado Springs Pueblo and\nI'm canyon city and so forth but I also work with people a nationally and I get to have the opportunity of actually working with people on their dreams looking at possibilities option and dreams\nCreating a life that they've always wanted and looking for self sufficiency and financial freedom you know Seventy five percent of the adult population Dave desires to be self sufficient um however\nMany of us don't know where to start including me up until several years ago we always wanted to be self sufficient independent but I didn't know where to go so I get to work with people who want to go on a journey of discovery\nSo you never too old to become an entrepreneur\nI was I was in my early fifties and actually it looked like\nThe worst thing in the world it happened to me I've been with a fortune five hundred company actually they were in the top twenty uh and had been with them for twelve years very successful had a multi state team\nAnd uh the company decided to go in a new direction and so my position across the enterprise was eliminated and so here I was with this company that's a hundred and sixty years old thinking I'm safe\nYou know nothing's going to happen here I'm going to have my benefits I'm if I wanted to retire here I could uh I'm gonna keep stacking up that four one K. and then\nLo and behold they eliminated all of the people in my position and got rid of the position and distributed our responsibilities to I'm younger less tenured people and so I sat there and thought well my gosh if this could happen\nAt this point in time right is it safe to go back into these corporations that you feel like I'm you're going to stay with forever and earn that golden parachute so to speak\nAnd so this is great for you a new career in coaching people helping them find of the special qualities the experiences that they have to enable them to the you know sort of walk with them while they're broadening their capacity and broadening their perspective\nYeah usually when these things happen then it's a window of reflection it's a time when people are looking and saying what else is out there and they start to look at those those dreams of being their own boss doing their own thing and believe it or not there are so many people our age that this is happening to them in the traditional\nVehicle of\nHaving a job in working for a corporation um often times they've been very successful and then something happens with the the company and they're going to go their own way and their position is eliminated and they're sitting there going oh my gosh\nBut they've got gas in the tank you've got so much experience they have so many skills and so I get to work with people\nWho want to nurture their dream of being their own boss and being financially independent\nThat's exciting for those of you are listening I mean\nA lot of times we get compartmentalized in our in our daily operations you know you look at southern Colorado and many people were raised with the bill and yes or you've been working for the company and you know there's been so many changes because there are just like leaves a story where the company made a joy of change that affected her\nSo many of us in our fifties and sixties or know affected by corporations stretch they look you'd have a discussion of terrorists you know and and those downstream effects of taxation can cause a couple of you to change strategy overnight\nBut you know there's a lot of different models out there and I love what you talked about earlier when you when you think of what a franchise is a business model and that includes things like licenses and distributorships um you know it's basically what I call a system and if you think of the acronym S. Y. S.\nT E M save yourself significant time energy and money and that's one of the reasons why\nI Love this business is because people who want to take control their destiny can ramp up fast they can really the go quicker because a business model has already been established it through an audit of overtime tweaked in and brought up\nUm and there's just so many different things out there for people to look at\nAnd as well said I mean it is a team sport and I've told so many people they said well I Want to do this business but I'm going to do it on my own yeah um and it takes sometimes three four times longer to do it yourself and it does to\nTo to get in capitalize it get a team working with you and take off fast and and that three or four years of time you use to grow something as you could do it in half the time you take a look at the resources that you pick up\nAnd the momentum that you gained so ... it was a great way to ... to interrupt\nYou know absolutely and you know doing start up completely from the ground up there are people out there that can do it and they're very successful at\nIt this is just a different model for me it's about efficiency I have a I have a girlfriend that she can she can create a financial platform a marketing platform and operational platform you know an HR platform and she can do all that from the ground up and you know ... you know hats\nOff to her um but for me I'm like I talk to me about a financial system oh my goodness no way I mean so so for me having these platforms and having them tweaked in on it at an already that's what really that's what really is good and you know basically when you look at franchises people think that they have to have the technical skills Dave\nBut you were in visiting angels\nWhere were you a gerontology\nForce officer and I'd never even been to a hospital and they were just piling yeah well I did television shows here I'm going to fly but what you know what the system helps you to learn those skills\nAbsolutely and that's what people think they think that you have to have the technical skills but most of the time there's only two skills you really need to have success in business model and to run it well and that is managing operations\nAnd following a system and that's because you know you're not always in the business you can be working on the business\nBut you know the really neat thing about it is that the clients that we work with and you know this is the meat thing there is no cost to work for me or work with me no cost whatsoever there's no risk there is no obligation I get to work with people all the time who just want to go on a journey of discovery to look at\nBusiness ownership and is it is that right for them is it the vehicle for them to get those possibilities options in dreams that Ninety five percent of clients we work with\nGo online to in a business that they wouldn't have considered on their own war had looked at him prematurely dismissed and part\nOf that is because they don't know everything else is out there and part of it is because we back into it we look at what are the things you want in income lifestyle wealth in equity we don't want you to buy a job yeah we want you to have the benefits that you want\nSo that's good I I think that you know this discovery process in everybody's life is the light bulb that comes on and you're sweating you're saying you're willing to do this for free\nAbsolutely and you know when it's a dream job Dave I mean you love it to you always knew of always talk to me about the the CEO of your life go make things happen just print up some cards and that's when I get to do all day I get to say hey let's get some clarity around it and you know what if you find out that this isn't the right vehicle for you\nThat's wonderful to because you've reached a point of clarity\nIs right and I'm Talking to your listeners right now because a lot of you are my age and many of you are older\nAnd you're thinking hey man I've done it's all washed up I waited for Social Security and the bottom line is you know we have entrepreneurs out there that are ... that are running home care companies ... we have people that are just starting at my age of sixty one they're just starting ... and they'll be doing that for Twenty years as long as you're alive\nSo it really is never too late to discover\nWhere your gifts are absolutely any now are expected life\nIs eighty five years old now I mean so what are you going to do with that time and think about things like leaving a legacy for your kids I mean what if you want it to you know and it was this was the big thing that I thought about my daughter\nIs entering her senior year of college and I've been talking to her I was talking to her all last year oh my gosh you're halfway there you know you're going to be senior these are the wonderful things I can see you traveling the world and you know she's a photographer a photo journalist that journalists and stuff and I said I can see you out there\nBeing a contract writer on travel around it and I was talking all these dreams\nAnd I was applying for positions\nThat made me go to sleep when I thought of him and I thought hey what about our dreams and how we telling our kids\nYou go live the dreams in the life that you want and yet we're sitting here and what are we do eat where soccer if I were were settling day were settling for us you know and yet that that really let it only sent have always wanted to be\nAlways wanted to be a business owner and when does elimination by position happened my eighty three year old mother\nWho had always heard my dream of being a business owner basically said well you better get on it it looks like this is your time\nThat's right that's right I Will tell you what if you're listening to the show right now I'm this may be a chance for you to just to think about is that me do I still have ... to become a
