three\nIf you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors\nIn I mean I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nLowered talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of\nAll the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nNot heard a whole lot about magnesium ...\nAnd he was magnesium so important there's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart or beat who very important factor in life\nAnd I would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this was associated with a a lack of magnesium and the bunny\nSimply lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first\nOf all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case study of people actually taking the ... formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches\nThere's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest\nAt well all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researcher it how do you get this into the system\nThe formula we have the count max formula is so fantastic because you get a\nPowder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink this cut down\nThis great my absorption rate is really a incredible because it it actually goes right into your blood strip\nAll

a great organization I'm\nHappy to be with lifeline they provide so much help to the community and help support that special programs at eh thirty some very happy to be there\nIt's a it's so great to see you again and uh we're going to be talking today on the show about lifeline and a ... rising people with what lifeline is and and really what an impact it's been for all of southern Colorado\nBut before we do that we have an annual event that you're sort of a really want to talk about today and what would that\nBe coming up is the eleventh annual safety of seniors conference sponsored by as thirty a and their circle of friends and it's a great event we typically have about two hundred and thirty seniors participating in this event every year and it's coming at on September Eighteenth\nRegistration is going to start at eight thirty and we just have to find that gay full as learning about and just safety information for seniors and a wide variety of information is going to be provided and a lot of time for people to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd we have about thirty vendors there that are going to provide a wide variety of information and so we would love to has as many people there as possible and we want to provide some great an education on safety for his\nGreat I remember when it was the first one I Love I remember the first one\nAnd it was very unique because it was a smaller gathering but it was really about really are influencing seniors to come and to learn about safety and that's just kind of state that's kind of where this has been and a what a great event it's been through the years and you it's nice to see it growing and people actively involved\nAnd it's just a lot of people there and so our goal today is to let you also know about it so those view that are listening will want to come\nYes um [noise] I had to get some information on some of the speakers were going to have and this is typical for most years we will have the police department there\nUm which will be our first and our lung talk and question and answer period we have chief gathering part coming and he will begin to poke around and out a little bit after nine o'clock and just go over ... updating as safety and information and crime information in\nPueblo and then and provided some time for anybody to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd then we also will have officer Brandon buffet there I'm just to answer questions that anybody might has so that'll be a great way for people to start a conversation about anything they might be worried about and then um we have some other programs later on in the day that will get some specific safety\nAnd we have we live in a great community um a lot of great support here\nAnd I think one of the one of the things that we often you know people get so comfortable in their in their life they get comfortable in their day to day\nAnd seniors you can just sort of lay down their guard a little bit and there are people out there that really want to take advantage of that I've done a number of radio shows a with our local law enforcement about fraud in\nThe in some of the types of things that that that are going on phone calls to our seniors and trying to build them out of things and I and I and I I'm not trying to scare anyone but I think this is a great place to come just to Research Center\nUm how you live your life what you're doing just to make sure that the ... if you're living independently ... where you are that you stay very cautious\nTo your surroundings and and uh it it ... it always helps to have more education about what's happening in the local community so people are really come how much does it cost to go\nIt's free so yeah it's free it's free and you get lunch and great entertainment as well so what a deal\nSo that's a ... the data this is gonna be September Eighteenth yet\nAnd that's a that's a Tuesday that's correct and if you come like you'd come early but if you're a thirties radiation begin mhm and when did when did the festivities\nCell and registration to eight thirty people have time to get a seat and walk around and visit our vendors and then we will actually have an executive director of ... Asher introduction and and then we will have chief down in ... shortly after that at ... little after nine o'clock\nBut they may have fallen and not told you and once we get into falls you know they can they can happen in series and then one day the fall is really the number one cause of why people die so ... did this is such an important topic and and this was a pretty affordable system isn't it Andrea\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um hospital possible hospitalizations I'm I'm a fall and especially laying there for a long time and\nIt's definitely something that you can be proactive with and and affordable product and that can help keep families face and keep ... parents at home longer and independent and help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know\nThat if they were to have a fall that and that it's just a push the button and they can get help\nAnd actually we do have a son and units that have father catching him so with that technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be unable to push a button and it's very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help\nAnd even if a button isn't pushed so um that's just\nThat's really great general for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there no one's around that they do fall under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independence that they're really seeking and then after that of course you got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but what a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it's small\nAnd it's not bad and and the one with the fall detection has to be one around their neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more on on the wrist and those are mostly for people that are more and just an ad in the home um by themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them\nAnd but with the ones around the Napoli has some that actually are on mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all the tension and on and and if they were to fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood\nAnd it would detect that fall or they could push a button and and it has GPS locating in it so that and help but be able to find them where they are\nOkay so somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do we get it set up how hard is it to get it set up at ...\nAt ... at the very easy and again you can just call the same number that you call for that the senior conference that's I mean my my number it's five for five when he went to jail and\nAnd just give us your name information and week well just figure out what kind of and questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need to get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get my my dad set up\nAnd so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nThat it's like this into the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it uses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape and that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah\nThis is good so if some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil as they go pass on that I'll just hollowed out for the neighbor you know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this is lifeline that they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in Pueblo\nTwenty six years ago and now look at it going all the way to Durango\nAnd and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of ... you learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and whether you're in assisted living whether you're an independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids I mean what a great what a great opportunity to have that extra hand in the house for under fifty bucks a month\nYes definitely so what does that number to call once more\nFive for five one two one two\nGreat that's so easy to remember where if you want to so yeah we be thinking about life why and if you don't already have it I Know that they could uh probably take care of your pretty pretty quick\nYeah and I did I did want to mention that they don't even have to have a landline at home and we also have a mobile units and even with our new go safe to button and that doesn't have to be connected to the base unit at all so and there are a lot of different options and depending on if they still have a home phone or if they have a mobile devices\nIn technology grant and this is the thing that amazes me all the time everything changes\nWhat great we're going to take a little break right now and the senior living today show and a rabbit a great discussion with Andrea ... about lifeline and\nBut uh there's another special event coming and we talked about at the beginning of the show but as soon as we returned again we're going
