him and explaining\nThe divide that exists in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about\nThis country surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never been worse\nAnd they made the civil war but but those were different circumstances a that was a specific argument\nAbout cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude can ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America as mountains\nSome people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I I've uh just sort of evolved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning ... and it may be present some\nAre solutions but they have to I have to be very careful I don't overdo do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are so that's coming up as the program on falls back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off\nApologizing to the nation\nApologizing the cabin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and the Kavanaugh episode codified is exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling with people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limit on how low they will go on how get braved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean getting back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born or and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it\nSo the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I bought [noise]\nBut they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence Kavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says buddies believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck

not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were sneezing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it

nine seats firmly order wing\nDemocrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you and me and for\nMajority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTwo hundred feet firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this\nIs a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nBut is that this is [noise] and yet they believe now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans you know I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that two thirds nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce obscenity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning in the Democratic column\nLet me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\n\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to\nGo out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ...\nWith the party\nThe left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump\nThat the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election night two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind of disgust\nOther than the alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the

and the SVU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nWitnesses when she was Fifteen Years old at the hands\nOf judge Brett Kavanaugh is is what they do folks\nI predicted that I told you this this is just the first of many she's gonna get book deals offered to hers they're going to be TV movies\nAnd HBO feature movie didn't really documentaries then there'll be probably one of those Netflix making of a murderer type series to explain how capital beat back her charges and scarred and ruined her for the rest of her life and all of that\nWe're just seeing the beginning here of the rehabilitation of balls the Ford\nAnd it starts with professor whole rehabbing ball the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill whole writes we live in a society that does not believe women\nThe many indignities that women experience of their day to day lives\nIs proof of this as is the continued attacks on Dr Balt the Ford after her testimony that had no evidence and corroborating witnesses we know that people who are survivors of sexual assault that did not happen do not experience justice for their trauma\nWe know that many of them choose not to report to the police and choose not to reveal their assault\nBecause they have to have no evidence or corroborating witnesses and the fear they will not be believed speaking of which grab audio
