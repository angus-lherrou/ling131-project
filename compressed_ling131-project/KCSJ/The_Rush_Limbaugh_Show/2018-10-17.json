know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch\nStory I said you mean about the show ... he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when suddenly said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but\nThere was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible there is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car\nIn the parking lot of the consulate\nThere's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service on watches sold them operated in Turkey so on the last ... had entered the password for the consulate wife my network on his watch\nWhich I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why five most people\nThink they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I

pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything if has got to be in tents everything has\nBlown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on I'm Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blew up on 'em every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all along the mother is going to\nGet the goods on how Trump's Foley election my chipping in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're there and look to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up\nBase\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been\nThey've bought it\nThey drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump gee even with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released within this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated\nRural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections\nI thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media rather\nThan break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped it up my mother\nIs gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking it up before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's throw the election is imminent that is what they're hoping\nThey're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there\nThe ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here\nIs\nWill create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that port handles disaster for Trump they'll ...\nAnd ... each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms wouldn't\nBlow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this\nIs going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic peaks lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is\nVery serious take them very seriously don't tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth\nBut you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that\nThat that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people to think about this series is it makes no one's about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched\nThis I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen really honest this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\n\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally\nOn affected by life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he'd one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it went with it\n\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's quite it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor now I imagine\nReal journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople who have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThe competing editor of the clean paper above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the ... story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed that\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls the guy to beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the news stands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nTo run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of it is press I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um\nIt's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it's hit everybody everybody as a rubber made including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's ... Brazil now I was I did not lose my play she's ... bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed and remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the

back to the phones we go I I'm I'm not through making the point is blue wave stuff but there's a lot of like here\nIs that CNBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories that are out here plus Don of Brazil about\nThis now I don't want to make too much of it but that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing back\nFor Strategic reasons and I still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but\nWe'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi\nIn a Damien nice to have you welcome to the ... network\nThank you Mr lumbar I appreciate it this is definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhen I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nUm so I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms and not not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh\nI don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the flight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worth\nThere is in in the\nIn the quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections\nI mean call me even cited this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it\nOut I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact\nOpposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman late procedure that the D. O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales that justice are blind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases do they had ... heard their futures dependent on it their careers dependent on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing indicting the Democratic nominee again ... the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in Mahler report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to\n\nNot have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally ...\n... ... ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves how long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is\nHow long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian ...\nJake Tapper start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not what about you play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple

crossing\nBack\nStabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer she's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call it a name she is a woman who attempted to run with him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like\nPeople don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on\nPeople talk this way this is what resent what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply looked at the things they say about

mark balls the Ford but simply ...\nFeet in the truth about her allegations I just I just find it to just a little bit hollow as though take your pick ticket that take your pick any left wing or on

she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive by it's had not\nAnd that then caused a meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of ...\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence\nPlaces people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap\nAnd reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply reminded everybody unreal world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and cause the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford vanished jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well it does happen but if she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that were there and say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in cabinet came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around the drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\n\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn or your who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that's a drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was thrown Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay is legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here ... the prostitute porn star is paying

think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than our time with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep\nDescribing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more ... low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved\nFor the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork you it was it was after the signing of Obamacare and after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nApproval from only five percent of Republicans\nAnd I

what\nHas it been confirmed if something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia has it been confirmed not confirmed so it will likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out\nAnd then they listen to music while they did all of this\nAnd of course\nUntil I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like\nProof existed in the form of audio recording

has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they were using to try to make that case\nBut I think there's

on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors you know that\nDr balls the Ford had two doors at something to do with a claustrophobia and fear\n\nAnd handed over to Google employees reading

a big difference than needing it for claustrophobia and the the as the like being afraid Kevin always going to show up at any moment in the last thirty five years well anyway\nEverybody has a home with a front door and a lock on most people have one front door for some people that's all they need to feel secure for others securing every door and every window is what's important\nTo feel safe inside\nNow how you go about securing all of those entry points now that's another thing early home security system providers gave you one solution and it was it was fairly expensive\nAnd then simply save home security came along offering a solution to protect all of your doors and windows in the most effective ways for far less money\nAnd they get that done by using state of the art technology
