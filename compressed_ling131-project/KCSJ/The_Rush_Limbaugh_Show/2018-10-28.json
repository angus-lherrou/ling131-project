you\nKnow there were never any attacked or these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered the Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply\nNo load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and like video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh\nNothing has worked what

believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that

ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this
