explaining that to me ... as long as I can hear you that you know that's all I mean\nThat's that's awesome I appreciate it but I just to answer your question are we can't divulge members I wouldn't\nThere are thousands of people who are lined up and probably will do that tonight and we're going to go down here as soon as we can we don't want to interfere with anybody we want to go as soon as possible you have been raised nearby we have\nThousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails on this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real interesting he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not\nConvey\nProper information about him as his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have yours are high\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best stepping pond yes uh should have\nThe ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even used that it\nUh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism I\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are so but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what was your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time their basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws and a win for what purpose\nMy point of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the\nModern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in honor militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be met for green\nRussia's law guide five Ninety dot\nHey I'm

a category five Fox has Evan brown tracking it live from Miami\nSince where they see the campaign see so I think I think Fox is dialing back you know on the potential you will time claims even though there are Democrats doing rallies like this\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing them and and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all you can't miss it\nThese people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time these are people that are up ... am happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally in your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids\nAre slowing and the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon\nRight I see you again banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get in\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the west army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies or the exact opposite\nAnd I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people and they're they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event\nAnd even if you do have some happy people with the Democrats sponsored have been audio doing in the last war because a Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else checked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about ... minutes worth the Trump rally crowd

their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss or on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so used to having it thrown right back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being laughed

impossible people are not going to vote for this guy that has become people regret voting for this guy they can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up and apologize to

that's why she lost she doesn't get it she never did Hillary said what was done last night in the White House is a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nReporter during a press availability of the oval office asked Trump about our comments what's your response to Hillary what's your response to Hillary saying what last night's swearing in was a political

claims against her husband are not\nLike the Kavanaugh's confirmation because her husband faced intense investigation\nHillary has a point we have to acknowledge she has a point the allegations against her husband were substantiated they were investigated and Bill Clinton was found to\nBe guilty he was found to be guilty of all kinds of things Kavanaugh is not has not ever will not be\nThere's not a single allegation against Kavanaugh that has any evidence or corroboration but all of the allegations against Bill Clinton had been proven Hillary's right she doesn't intend to be\nBut she is right the allegations against her husband were substantiated Bill Clinton paid an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar settlement the Paula Jones\nJennifer Flowers have audio tapes

print because they couldn't validate any of it Jane Mayer showed up\nAt what was it the Atlantic there was some kind of a\nConvention or festival or some such thing New Yorker reporter James mayor\nSuggested in an interview that she ... Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh out of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told Elle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors and that helps to stab her she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere was a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated\nStory to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nObese you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from all the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story\nDidn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people something happen just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is that Chris Smith of Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you\nWas just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts in Internet for it yesterday but with this novel as it is and Hillary claiming that their pain neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried when the mom and he left and the actors and", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "10"}
