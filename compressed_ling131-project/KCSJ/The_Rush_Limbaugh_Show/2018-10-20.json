so he felt the need doing expanded\nTo include South America\nWhen other reason there isn't much into your DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine lineage they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story\nI get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA in any of this but ...\nThe media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary\nDNA test and he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate the future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do any ... that she wouldn't show up as Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion in my my dubious a nature when it's\nIt comes to this blue wave business\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that and so the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point to we're going to take the Senate but if you look at\nThe reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten\nDo you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand four team in terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships are you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to where in the in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed dollar polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power\nIn terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so\nFrom two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people willing to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they could do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean the having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift make people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so\nSays the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no return peasant done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not gonna see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey\nSoaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight team is this a CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million\nJobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat equals a roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees\nCan set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would\nBe unhappy by it or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote and yet\nThere isn't a middle Lincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six game

happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it's something you'd never Trump person but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen that Democrats attempt on Capitol\nRepublican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up

considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this DNA\nDid not actually use samples of

touting that it's true is she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indiana Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is pathetic\nI think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every ... they're saying that what Bill\nWent and did with Monica ... no no no no no that was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it and selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who or soon to be barking on what\nA stadium shore or yes\nBill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump

nobody cares what they have to say not like\nPeople care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is
