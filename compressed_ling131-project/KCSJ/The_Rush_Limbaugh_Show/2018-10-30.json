I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd\nIt's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one is not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nNot a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel bad and something's not right\nAnd that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

the\nVideo claims that Trump's support for a border wall and attacks on the media make him comparable to dictators\n\nDictators not attacked the media they own the media\nDictators don't spend their

the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's I'm\nA ... ... it it it's we're we're dealing with\nAsk ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right 'cause what's causing this is causing a discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July Nineteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques that it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThat weren't going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the those black coaches were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio and he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that\nIn a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's\nWhat's different now there is no interest in how\nWe don't even make a serious effort have assimilating we're Balkan icing if they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population\nBecause modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got to come together we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being\nSet up that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you're ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer the legislation that in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nI don't make the solution to this is enterprise

suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise]\nTo comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller I lost her when she is how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I I've never seen that\nSo I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light a I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what happened and that that that has been my point it's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act the media I hated\nIt was in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file a lawsuit was trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified that these bigots\nWould refuse\nTo bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along Pence who's the governor the media was outraged and they began\nTo report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude\nAnd all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses would you bake\nA pizza when you when you make a pizza for winning and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't do it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this

them she thought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd we're racists bigots sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and\nSo gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a the synagogue shooting quality obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they\nAre the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who knows they are not by definition\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm and on many people still\nDoes we still have a lot of people in our side still want a couch out of the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the electoral\nResults just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nDidn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday\nBut apparently Chris ...
