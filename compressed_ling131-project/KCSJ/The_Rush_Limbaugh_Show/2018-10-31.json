talking the freight formal\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's not on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair\nThey continue to point to slavery as the primary\nEvidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration\nPolicy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and filled of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood into a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be right medic continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people and notice how quickly they want to do that notice\nHow quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and so I went to the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either loved Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that didn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nIncidents these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody

Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump a good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nThe hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when they decided that time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or

remember seeing them go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in the last place out there\nAnd ah this was that was pre Trump and the\nBelief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where is the damn thing\nWhere is it Don women even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board caught it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... certainly remember that Americans are ...\n... ... ... ... they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall\nWith it and it became a

you ever uh forget what you call that program you\nKnow I just found that the kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show him that many people especially it was a brand new planning that I don't\nKnow whether you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he says about what will you remember the model number\nNo but since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the dumb somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going down is unusual and uh we went out to the sea salt\nIn it I'll

cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if that momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline than wire Trump's rallies still ... over the he's got one in Fort

he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties know what is messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh attitude\nOr anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful\nThinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis was ... you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on the election day and I don't believe in Rio's does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe it did not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close I mean we don't know\nWe never know until the aftermath here's\nTrump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies\nThe American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade\nOn this as one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why\nIs it why is it when he gives it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America as you know it which is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today\n[noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations\nWe had balls the foreign with her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact of capital is spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named a Supreme Court he is the passes it gets ... got the confirmation vote and is in sworn in\nWhy did the media drop it\n\nKavanaugh was such a riot\n... S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rate serial rapists where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway\nIf the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political\nDont for which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed and the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice they would\nBe out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kevin ... did you believe ball Z forward and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions the reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true\nIt was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capital of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring bossy for up until the very end as a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made laying eyes terrify the here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all\nDon't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week if not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot to wait to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof than it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost and their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurt Democrats hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women\nThat were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought any longer\nIn Monday Night birthright citizenship is ridiculous and

with us Hi\nThank you so much I close my call I was a twelfth grade\nAmerican history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession and ... was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class her cause courses because I couldn't handle how they had we sized American history [noise] what's the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is one ... millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our honors and say come on in the way the Democrats want it to him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship is specially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper I live and if you had a disease called trek karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were a strong and we're not when dead\nNow once the ship doctor perform chance examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps and if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people\nWere sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quite not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nWhere am I that's what people are thinking listening to you and tell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved\nWith gold and then I found out I was going to be the one have you on the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it from the world and the whole global buddy not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shut it to think about it kind of history he's gonna be learning it's um I don't think I'm giving him for Christmas one of your books\nTo oh wow you know very was hurt\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it he's not gonna learn it from his own history books they're all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties did a survey and the most popular\nHigh school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference neighbor I'm like a one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in an American history\nThe name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nNow we were a much newer in younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was Rick wired that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that in that\nRoom erupted into a game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they

was\nGreeted by a hundred protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protest or not support what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did come they

done that that's what conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four a and there are those examples where were you know\nThat that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can\nI can show your countless in in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in herself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four ...\nDid I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty some of them he predicted was off by two but nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out we didn't do just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats the left was\nDon ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen they ended up being surprised the brightest minds been greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out to four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mint terms and\nHer final stretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democratic majority\nBut this is here splitting do a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat what two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't\nThe only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we've just concluded here that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not just ... days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races in ... the ... of numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slam Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend\nDay here is we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality a penny is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests but what about the\nNineteen representative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money and to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how reliable arms on this thing and then the next\n... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know in the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nElse is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the candidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen\nTerm elections and there's feverish campaigning coast to coast in Florida there are too tight races both Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican rather than just want to be governor but Gillum
