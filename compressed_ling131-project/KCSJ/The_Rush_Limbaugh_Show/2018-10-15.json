I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nIt's just not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you hit people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the elections uh the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result\nPolling data and says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the transition pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest\nLandslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide provided that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created\nBetween the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but I don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union but mine was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hobby on some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily within within the stupid country for so many years I you willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and not going to do it any more they understand okay\n[noise] so\nWhat once again we have here the concept but just so hostile to have the it sounds so hostile it sounds to me it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left\nWe want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be wife\nDuring the socialists they think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves\nAnd this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on ... says he's going to do something he's going to\nWe've seen positive numbers and consumer sentiment and retail sales but both missed expectations so we're focused their\nThanks Michael this is the ... stock market report with Michael O'Keefe truth and desperate officer for steeple Nicholas in company incorporated member S.

minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort by Lesley Stahl\nIs ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair it's six of one and a half dozen the variety is not so much a celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is\nA but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors actresses\nTV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump and Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in states prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you to try one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage\nOf what general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments explosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice it sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her\nWhy she is undermining NATO Trump already called her out on it for doing this\nThe Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got on the roster coming up probably do he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell them but my opinion is with the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I\nI think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laughed but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised by this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else have you learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment is full\nRush Limbaugh\nMuggy like be met for\nRe runs a blog I might not be a\nDa da da na na na na ... stay have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck

Michael's path of destruction and Lisa ... is President Trump and the first lady or in Florida\nThe bottom fifty per cent paid three percent there isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every ... both parties\nRunning around and we're going to middle class after the little ... bring the burn through red but we got to ... when there isn't much to cut anymore when it comes to income taxes now which small\nOf taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone have free point two five percent of all taxes one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty of which is a little round it to fourteen hundred\nFor teen hungry tax payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent of the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich not decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share now this is\nAs it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce\nIncome tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if you if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for gene hungry\nPeople out of three ... some odd million is it fair that fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change\nBecause if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom settled ... percent so you need to pander to them you\nNeed to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the lived ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes that we are going to ... and so the bottom Seventy physical yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's

speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great this guy's blacker than Obama this guy's on my side just guys going to do wonders for me\nHow does he know what's going on in\nTrump's in they have a crystal ball\nThat note he is not racist I this is the kind of think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him it befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number just as a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity\nOf consequences for illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their\nParents it was the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painted and enforce had one for them you launch that zero tolerance policy to deter families with children and then everybody decided and of course you don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate\nWhen you allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our consul you gonna go back to ... lashes\nLeslie for coming into our country illegally and part of\nI mean part of the reason I have the blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states you know my\nFault Leslie I've done such a great job of the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now\nShe says she misspoke there this law on the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner had many good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nOnce they see it was on the books but he didn't force it what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump has enforce it but the Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just in that the one that separate they don't run from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and\nThey had a whole premise some guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nOf a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families whether it's a law that he inherited I've looked at explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally and has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids are put in much better surroundings and Sanders while their their family their their their adult parents cases are being adjudicate there's nothing\nThere's nothing me this is the United states of America we do not due to kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more in a smear\nThat the Democrats on the left of engaged in an Trump does not back then\nNBC News radio I'm I'm

what we have to the phones and this is Scott\nIn Oklahoma City right to have you here hide\nRush couldn't talk to you know it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti bail them a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this is a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now to that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah and so when we need to know how much of a percentage\nOf pressure you are versus oppressed this ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists concept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nLet glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so you're more than welcome that's a good host I have ever that no one knew thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out comes straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection adult eight actually has basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA co habitats with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people\nIntersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old pressed she's passed it in any way she is a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you've never seen me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American is\nClay just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor Afrikaners are not black\nUh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks in\nOkay All right I just want his best because a sub Saharan this is somebody what are you in sub zero what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent than some people really get confused you're jumping from from India\nOr overt sub Saharan Africa is below the arid desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I
