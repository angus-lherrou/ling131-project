John decker live at the White House\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent middle ... even if it's sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would\nBe covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road CNN is is not\nWall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet everybody\nWants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like that where they didn't want it to last and so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gamut is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not\nGoing to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody\nHas to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two\nThousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states since ... Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTwo thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and it'd be one of them start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the ... in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human PC\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to get her I just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles\nA day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen\nVideo of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand\n[noise] and\nThen of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News ... ...

motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe\nHave somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help the benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having them may I ask a bunch of experiences there\nIs no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever we may as well not have any\nBorder if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and

have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as

attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer out\nWe're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned about this ... saying that we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou didn't you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's

the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona than he is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN and MSNBC ABC CBS are not showing us

this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\n\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call it lacks ability in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed there what have you\n\n... ... the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThat is the number of people the size of crowds to into what Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you know those pictures in the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand

type a lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it\nSince Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I are separate putting the military before but this one does perils and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving or steep poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife or am I gotta let it play\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it\nThat wouldn't be enough okay what about this what about the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and what\nWas the end of the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your like you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force not lethal\nYou only have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it's you know we ... we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the presidents would be okay so there's ... you think the cherry showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they are not used to it I don't know how to do it\nNow that still terrible you know I ...

mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because it'll like Trump's manners because they think Trump has goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's no line to hold off\nOn this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding an end to the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if\nThat's what you want to be that you got to vote Democrat because that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful\nAmerican needs to be unleashed whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nArgue better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes you are not capable of your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to the wise that
