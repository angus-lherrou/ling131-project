totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified so there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part and think some Democrats do not think that this don't range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\nWell let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that\nConservatism is made up of their range lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think that that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote intimate [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea\nWell we don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh for the midterm elections\nIt is a\nInteresting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides\nOf this\nAnd that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party in the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad\nInsane crazy percolating compounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been ... loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen\nAnd his cabinet situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her policy wants to see\nThe F. B. I. documents released\nShe wants a full fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Jerrold Nadler of a house Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're gonna impeach cabin or they're going to investigate even getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side and his cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging\nIn what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I Know it's not even ... like ... but we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that the suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the Democrat rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it and rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about\nThem\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that\nI can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not but for those that don't get it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative\nOf the uh the party\nAt large here's Jake Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh foes fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo if there's any doubt that the opposition to Kevin all of a sudden hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited hospitals for the seriously\nMentally ill enlist shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery whereas off and on earth waiting as anything I ever heard in ... and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning with dude\nAnd then the role was called but it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was jewelry was rage was he\nIt was poisons in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness maybe the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to\nThemselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all this kind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the opposite\nThey may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in to not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics envy insane face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get more rabbit\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen that

now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentlemen that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all this\nTrump action now I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nAct and I'm concerned on interested in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies\nYou can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said at every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't\nDraw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you that they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd\nBe they have the\nTrump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\n... with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy to try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe\nKamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able to show the Democrats thinking\nThey've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as\nMuch attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody\nOn the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide stadium toured\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show\nIt'll feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in\nPublic service while also discussing issues of the day and looking toward the future the tour is being sponsored by live nation wide nation also hosting a stadium tour for Michelle my bell\nThe Clinton turtle start in Las Vegas November Eighteen this Sunday this was after the midterms it'll crisscrossed the country ending in Los Angeles next April\nTickets go on sale this Friday October to twelve and they're not cheap if you want to see the Clintons joint speaking tour that Clinton stage show the Clintons national stadium to her at the park theatre in Las\nProfit it shows you everything from crypto currency is or how they work how to buy them one by\nEven if you think the ... to bubble has burst for you to like four to four technologically challenged you must see this education course now go to ... do you do class dot com that's from review of class dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nI Want to get back to the phones and here is Sean in Philadelphia right to habeas are high\nHey Russia I'm a big fan of yours thank you appreciate the I'll ... I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment one question or comment is\nIt's going around this talking point that uh you know since his cabinet victory that the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nUh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixty and it got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them just even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\nThe Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a\nBuck the Republican governor California is is closer than is running if Gavin Newsom that anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't seen the meltdown that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again\nUm anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all\nVery quickly\n[noise]\nYou're\nListening to Russia's week in review\nHey welcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain tied behind my back as always made interests of fairness and equality [noise] sorry last caller\nSean from Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from\nPolitical just just today political story ready for this political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly already leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling me right and\nIt you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers\nTo eight teams the majority so to resign seats firmly or leaning Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that two thirds nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's going to be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide disgust with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the\nPeople of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election night\nThrough thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching me I mean you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and\nYou know officer you know\nOur government is separating the two parents that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the civil that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this\nCountry where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\nProbably best known for throwing Washington's best dinner parties during Democrat presidency's during Republican president Xi's nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best\nDinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just that everybody that got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend him while telling him he needed to resign one of them\nWas a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower I knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture of the guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught I'll Try to find one here and show you on the digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says John Powell once assaulted her but she didn't come\nForward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of hard to be in senator you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she asserts that happen in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and ordered Randy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer uh Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and a cab driver would lie about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car and Senate screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think that and power and got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot and God\nBut I went to the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um but\nBut you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more bite we got Times Square here's here's another reason why number forty three when\nI think about it I thought I'm so glad", "show_name": "The
