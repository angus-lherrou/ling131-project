goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that dot CA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think these package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the hoping into turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state they are going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to

going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening

it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people's the inter find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and

to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you if you wanted to decorate\nTo justice and\nI I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators on a drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing it for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity you might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox and he called Trump a\nTotal front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos and\nDivision they will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the ... the room the Limbaugh the room was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portraying himself as on involves getting any policy

up\nAnd I marveled at this and how how the relationship between Obama and the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable\nAnd all those lives about Obamacare you keep your

S. A.\nWe didn't uh let's see there'll be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent his highest yet I don't need a despite the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN\nPoll and it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBuck forty seven percent in whatever poll with is is Trump's highest and also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating you have a twenty ten ... terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nThis historically a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president mid term but how many seats the Republicans win in the two thousand ten mid term some of the the three\nThe Republicans one six\nThe three now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but kirks point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the and a bit of an upset\nThere's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this it is yes your ego barely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum\nWas leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum had some regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated for\nA we had the news that he had he paid an under\nCover ...\nThe money to buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails and tax raise questions on ... trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a Politico story today actually saw it last night that Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThat Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win\nEverything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political stir and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drugs has links to them that are the socialists of America appear ready to win and

Charlie Cook report the vaunted inside the beltway\nAnalysts\nWho take a look at every election inside out with the election just eleven days away now it seems that the overall Senate playing field won't change much although what appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even tighter\nThat says\nIt's getting more difficult to see a path to the majority for Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp heading for defeat in North Dakota\nDemocrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority the one way would be the whole the five Democrats seats and toss up and pick up three of the four Republican seats in toss up\nIf you will read the book report I'm not going to bother telling you which ones those are but that's how they analyze the bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has been moved to toss up\n\nIn the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it\nNew Jersey being in in toss up\nAnd Florida remains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he the incumbent he would have the\nPath to victory in Montana

so much that we don't know yet and we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is despite all of that there is enough information gleaned simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that\nThe the deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what has been done in these\nPast two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why did the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was how many dropper or your advisors who's obviously spills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea he drugs do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that stepping up was twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador\nIs stepping options you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted it in his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point that investigations go get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state\nWants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it gets theirs\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years ... who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it
