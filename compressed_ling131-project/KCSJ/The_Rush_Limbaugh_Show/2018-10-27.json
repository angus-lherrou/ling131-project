result of the shooting incident\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the caravan that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let and it's the wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid germs at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nCan't pin it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in place\nActive on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he\nSeparated families the border and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want it but last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where would they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles I also\nThink if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border may cause they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are very real limited that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up\nRight as the polls open on mid term election day\nSo if they had been walking\nFor what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course a ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News in the a P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThey're hoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing to join the main group which reportedly and swelled its ranks with several people who've already been ... or did the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the more again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city of tapping Chula the smaller group trailing entered walked a mile away from Honduras late Sunday according to the aid pay\nSome in the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across\nThe border with includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times\nEight twenty nine year old the inner Anthony ... is reportedly was deported for the six time from the U.S five months ago said they catch you and you're trying to get back he has a son and a U.S citizen girlfriend living in Birmingham, Alabama according to the Washington Post\nJust like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades I mean it's it's an invasion that has so far\nLead to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the country and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them\nBut let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers\nOf this thing began to deny the members food and water\nLet's see if the people behind this creating a humanitarian crisis one week before the Irish jeweler rival\nOh my God\nLook what's happening it's in the middle of the Mexican does or doesn't they've gotten out of water and there's no for my we've got to do something we got to do something\n\nThere is a hurricane coming that Mike oh well it's a perfect storm that couldn't be\nComing to fruition here this is the ultimate\nOctober surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this here's let me go from Texas He was on today with the Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us\nWhat you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way to the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats and Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents ten Nineteen sixteen after ... gangs came across\nThe border New Mexico and killed a bunch of people not only did he four Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's I'm going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs me stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the the way I talk to the Louis he'll talk about Jeffrey is talking to Jeff and I don't even know who these types of who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions Jeff Sessions or big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points\nThey already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country and if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary mover is behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this is the left behind it\nFor a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review and we're back great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new weak and broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight to ... to eight eight to [noise]\nOne more of an Louie Gohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill cameras says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply conservative violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nIs it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind would want this who when their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they've they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration\nOf how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the\nElderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest they're being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a masked a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't been here for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nCom\nFormulate your [noise] dominant gets to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people worked up\nAbout that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence from up by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because of positive comments out for\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do\nStand aside for seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms\nOf it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because\nOf the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized has the border if they bomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is about the people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can't try to deal with this on his own he needs to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on\nTape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends and we will continue as we always\nHave to get them off\nTo Russian by be Mitt and work\nOn the radio

and wreck and ruin everything we'll tackle this\nAnd much much more when we get back after an obscene profits time out ...\nYears ago making a murderer became less the TV show then a force of nature and veto uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and\nIt was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan gassy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to overeat budding emerge\nMounting a murderer is now in the ... radio as to when the fog\nOnline at ... dot com and on your phone with our ... radio lab\n[noise]\nHeartbreak in Pittsburgh I'm Joe ... in the morning has begun in Pittsburgh after eleven\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past him kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to\nPromise to do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support it but able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to their Jim Acosta\nIn Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring\nAnd cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it\nAfter all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you keep falling for the lives and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore\nBut what is troubling as to what behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes and he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly yeah\nOh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump has been working is spend like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you\nAre which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to a David go lurk near brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times on this\nProgram over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... way\nBack when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate ...\n\nAnd let me give you some quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming\nAmerica's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrint says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist\nFor future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten and this is so\nRight on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American
