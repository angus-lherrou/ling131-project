women have JFK I make I make the money all went away from having to them but here comes Donald confident a prostitute\nPays him the four women\nThese four women have one thing in common Dianne Feinstein Hillary Clinton Stormy Daniels she's the one I couldn't think of their lives have been more and\nAll four of them\nAre just raided damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted twenty different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people twenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown\nAnd again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quotes and make up for the dearth of Native American DNA\nDr Carlos ... among pay use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand\nIn for Native Americans now she's out there touting that it's true or she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in her Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is ... and\nI think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself ... they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ...\nNo no no no no no that was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the meat to move but she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be you barking on what\nA stadium chore Oh yes bill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get\nIn on it there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has that Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habit\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had it and it really the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe wake of Donald Trump is likely is it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave her radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as a rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed and inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program in Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never\nHas happened every attempt to supplant\nTake over relegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up to get the kind of\nCrowds would they want you may think rushed enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that what we're going to find out\nCommon sense will tell you you'll read Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't drop ... campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would've been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look what I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the good rule David analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN\nAnd then he went to five thirty eight and then he went to vox back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nNothing has gotten rid of Donald Trump nothing hasn't turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody\nFor destruction whenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone already damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking use only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't\nLeave with it it was it a central part of the Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball the Ford could not pull this off under pressure\n\nI'm Still in shock the balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that uh fifty whatever year old woman literally talks against human she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how you talk to the Baltimore and you're running around the beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talking you're running around the beach out there\nUh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed or yelled out or whatever\nAh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the real objective\nFrom the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if\nThey have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... the thirties and those are the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did was cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns of people who were sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat would warrant such a thing but the Democrats didn't care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well\nNone of it has worked\n\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... I'm telling you that they are\nTeetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it all together and it's in this universe framework contacts I just\nI don't see this Massey blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but\nThese are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for him [noise] we'll see I mean look it's possible that I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing\nWhat's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground\nActual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against them Democrats having\nFewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq Hussein oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American and check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\n\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold that tall all Rourke\nRace thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closing Beto has told them to go pound sand\nThat tone has told them if you're a lecture that important and you're going to raise the money yourself I'm going to ... ... that's the way I Want money used is the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but nice him\nHe had he wanted not part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\n'cause it was nice the office of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with his mom didn't have confidence of coat tails\nAnd that ... is not going to want to share any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who's by the way what does he down seven or eight points now the latest poll\nIt's not fair that Beto has more than ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats\nThat's what he's saying that he won't do 'em yeah outlook also have the um the ... situation\nAnd there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he is Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by its purpose here is again\nThe drive by his are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump\nTo ... murder my other way just so you know there are a couple of CNN ... pronouncing your name could show jeep because there's two genes in there\n... it's a very big ... where's your view on a general

be frustrating\nUnder my tribe is joining the lowest standard of living in western hemisphere others and have you gotten rich South Dakota so I Know what I'm Talking about it for people I Hope\nWell I was you know what I'm Wondering if this aspect of it I mean I'm here's Elizabeth Warren claiming that she is a member of this ah mistreated minority but what she'd do unfortunately all of this is trying to make her better as trying to make her look better trying to improve things for her she's not\nTrying to parlay this into something for her quote unquote Indian relatives and people\nThat she hasn't mentioned a tribal connection at all\nWell because there isn't one I mean that she has mentioned that she Cherokee because the high cheekbones which I think\n[noise] gee I mean millennia Trump has high cheekbones and nobody's going to say that she's Cherokee [noise] I think I think all of this is offending a lot of people she doesn't want to yourself to a tribe because that'd be the fastest way and they have this blown out as non story\nNBC News radio I'm I'm Robert\nPresident Trump is on Twitter today maintaining he has no financial interest in Saudi Arabia just like he has no such
