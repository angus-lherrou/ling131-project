and Obama never got\nTo their homes just F why\nWe still condemning them don't misunderstand\nThe bombs were intercepted by the postal service at one of the distribution centers so they were discovered very quick into bomb that was sent to CNN didn't even get sent to the right place\nIn terms of where people work at CNN and it was addressed to John Brennan a who doesn't even work at CNN

around\nMade to look like a drill ranged lunatic Trump supporters and so in the midst of this\nAtmosphere we have this series of bombs that were supposedly sent today explosively to Democrats\nAnd it just there's a smell test that this stuff has to pass and\nSo far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain what to make this\nUh this is just it's it's it's not it's not Republicans that show up for example at the offices of the family or what what is it a pro life groups offices\nSome guy shows up on with a gun and it was going to shoot people got caught before he was able to shoot at family Family Research center I think yeah Republicans just don't do this kind of thing even though every event like\nMass shootings remember every mass shooting there is a Democrats in the media tried to make everybody think right off the bat that some Tea Party or\nDid it or some talk radio fan dated or some Fox News viewer did it turns out it's never ever the case not one of these bombs went off\nAnd if a democratic operatives purpose here is to make it look like hey you know there are mobs everywhere to the moms are not just Democrats mobs I mean look at this you got people here trying to trying to harm CNN and Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton and Debbie ... show and\nYou know it just it it it might serve a purpose here\nBy the way I guess what's also not in the news now and that's the that's the other mob that's finding its way north through may call attempting to crash the U.S border at or near election day that story is off and I'll tell you there's another story that's not being covered right down that is the declining blue wave\nThat was supposedly automatic and going to happen a week ago and a month ago but we're not going to let this side track us\nWe are not going to be distracted there's only so much you can say about this incident until we have more information\nAbout speculating would\nBe fun but since we can damage all bombs here at the ... network we don't want to go too far down this road I Do know that people want to weigh in it or wait in on it on the phones and we'll get some of that in right now starting in Atlanta this is Tanya and your first stop was how're you doing Hi\nHi Russ Crane can be on your show you about how about yourself a little nervous um\nWait a minute wait why why why don't I don't know why are you

compassionate and helpful [noise] time will go on and we've all we've all learn who it is targeting these innocent Democrats we will learn why these innocent Democrats were targeted and probably whoever did it will be\n... and we will find out who they are where they are why they did it who pay them\nOr if they were not paid by the simple fact remains Democrats in America are at risk\nTo save them to protect them vote against them\nA public service announcement from me your host Rush Limbaugh and the idea of\nThe uh the bomb here as the bombs it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise] so I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing to show me right\nSo Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill showing and come back here and they start sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn end to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy ranges is [noise] I mean [noise] the elevator doesn't go to the top floor like to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal\n\nWhy would someone smart enough to make a functioning mail bombs actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to an election what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter] if somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left this much\nDoes he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think in all ... what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this\nWay if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on your your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports and at\nRestaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got\nAnd so if none of that work if all of that backfired and ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do\nYou might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side\nYou might want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters perceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place\nWas on ah the Fox Business Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here\nAnd Tom ... all the polling data that they have it real clear politics\nAnd analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one the seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats plenty of out of that sort of two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races the G O P can hold the house\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\n\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n\n[noise] and Trump is a great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sends an email\nEver new it's a cycle and you can print\nNews radio I'm deem you to a suspicious package sent to CNN studios in New York City was reportedly address to former CIA director John Brennan renting ran the CIA during the Obama administration earlier this year President Trump revoked Brennan security clearance\nBrennan has been highly critical of Trump's actions\nThe discovery of the suspicious packages CNN prompted the evacuation of the time Warner center that followed news that the secret service intercepted suspicious packages mailed to former President Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton all three packages have been identified as potential explosive devices\nThe White House is reacting Sarah Sanders noted that a full scale criminal investigation is underway\nFor from Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning this and the strongest pops a language saying that they condemn the attempted violent attacks made against President Obama President Clinton's Secretary Clinton and other\nPublic figures and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law the United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take appropriate action\nTo protect anyone threatened\nBy these characters quite a strong statement but it's clear from this morning that I hear the White House during a crisis mode they're trying to stay in front of this story and uh they're letting everyone know the president has been briefed\nTons Nichols reporting a Miami building that houses the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is being evacuated doo doo suspicious package sent by mail\nThe return address on the suspicious packages found\n'em at the Clinton Obama insurance residences or the return address belongs to be in the official Debbie Wasserman Schultz obviously the return address to say there is no suggestion obviously that the congresswoman sent these packages right now her for the office has been evacuated his police investigating a package there\nThat's Craig Melvin reporting you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio [noise]\nShowers likely off and on throughout the day today fifty five for a high forty furloughed tonight was ... Sunday in warmer tomorrow is sixty six looks like upper sixties low seventies through the weekend [noise] loving that's the beauty of Madison read [noise]\nCan I ask you a quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how how many are the are the Clintons an obstacle for the upcoming mid terms of the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium chore third team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and\nTalk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons aren't anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on this phony collusion story to lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much age and so much anger the wife and I remember hearing is not sick it just it just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on\nThe phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia or been within that there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate\nThat you very much rush you know it's a you're\nTalking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh you know that that information out there for the masses of pain you know\nQuite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nDemocrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong all along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around would it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat\nIn cocaine and a lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nBut the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like that Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously have set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot walk\nIs out there trying to claim credit for this economy wasn't he wouldn't know how to create in fact the Democrats are the people that have people on their side that love bombs\nBill ...\nOne of Obama's buddies and in fact but I'm not saying there is any connection do not misunderstand me\nBut the other Sondra bocce is right on the\nMoney here Here's Mark in Orlando or as I guess in Orlando in Florida right to have you here with us mark ...\nMake it did U.S Russia a\nTruly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary enemy of domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kinda thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already plan to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush he taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off and so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy\nTheorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them as soon as I say this was a philosophy that I have a stone for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons\nDesperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the what was it iron my shirt\nUsed to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us and she said you know I could never say this outside this
