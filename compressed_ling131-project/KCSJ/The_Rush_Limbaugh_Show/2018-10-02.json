their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brett that was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine gutted artist did his cartoonish interpretation of it\nAnd the fireman is

with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight it's just Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ms ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is nasty

their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kevin in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein you know this\nThis is a leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the Florida ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it I remember I don't know if that was\nThe week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding
