simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday\nBy Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but\nThey weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge her she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played right along and without had ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was\nA all Trump is doing is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristie ball the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything\nAnd he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far as to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of caught their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's the vents play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and\nWe have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right to oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique if\nThey trumped developed I don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans have Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nAfter he makes it an

we've done the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick ... ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether\nShe's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incidents have happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage and the angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so\nShe said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before", "year": "2018", "show_name":
