Fox News President Trump wants more information from Saudi Arabia after it released an explanation how journalists to mark his show he was killed he made the comment after hosting a political rally in Nevada\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than the\nFuror trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not\nBut it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in

that it it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes rebuilt\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they ... if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all\nAbout destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watch this I've seen two

relationship with the prime minister the u._k.\nNo no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way

true of all I can tell you is for what it's worse\nThere is in in the in the\nQuote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do\nShould impact

it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this\nIt may even be a written regulations for all I Know\nBut I I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman lay procedure that the D.
