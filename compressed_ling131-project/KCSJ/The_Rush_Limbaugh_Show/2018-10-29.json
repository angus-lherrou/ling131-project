said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have the Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but um there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're

dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that and all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of

grew up\nI mean it's hard time I grew up with ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grow up and military synagogue my dad was in the air force but there was never politics never came current events did but not politics\nLet me ask you this is it's not like me ask you this ... in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in your appearance that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't I said that they were I mean because what I'm going to\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had but nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's it is a religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal\nYou're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out now with the disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel's doing that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book 'cause if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] but um yeah but I I don't\nI used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheism and you see that they're anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing assuming Islam but I mean you know but I Do the it's a it's anti God\nThat's exactly right I was wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes image judgmental isn't right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else it bears no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say but you are\nThere's all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's any Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it\nSo this has been in Pittsburgh than it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting\nA Jews in a way that they would want to go she'd have to think about I think that this is these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous\nAnd it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nGlad you because I'll tell you\nThere's a lot of people that think and they're predominant bite thank you thank you so much Rachel I purchased racial ... Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do a lot of people think it's\nGoing to dampen a turnout what you you would think I'm wrong or you\n\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by Senate Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nWell there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in ... fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump\nI have I have an\nEntirely different which is why I did the show opened today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it has this happens to these two events come along and they I this is that this has to be what it is their thinking\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the president\nWhat he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how it's Washington the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be\nPunished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern government as an agent of power\nTo enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes place a Web says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea that Washington should be able to\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American\nViewers are looking at in terms of murder\nI don't want to add a lot of the reason I was a murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible\nFor fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... looking at him as a murder we didn't say that no we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to emerge\n[laughter]\nNo they are so they they when when they're when they're confronted with what
