now being referred to as a lovable little teddy bear\nType guy in the New York times\nThere is now I Know I went through this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks you know I read my tech blog news I read everything there are still\nPeople attempting\nVia they're reporting to suggest that there\nWas a recording of the murder of ...\nFrom his apple watch my friends this\nIs item number one that aroused my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this inserting on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying\nAny relation any any complicity in this story so\nWhoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by showing these apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been misappropriated\nAnd has been falsely accused of\nReporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is L. T. E. or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple and well actually fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operated what you do get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self like we didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch\nFailed to me are doing just ceased to be a slave to the phone\nThe other two ways or blow to and why fight\nAre the three ways that day they can get to watch in data can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and\nThere there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that\nWatch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to his weight by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max you get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations\nBeing able to monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... that couldn't happen so he only had a way it would be why\n\nThat would only work if the wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\n\nAnd the wife I connection on watch\nJust because the phone connects the wife by when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because the phone it's parents who uses it\nThen like if you're at home you're ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs\nYou'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that when he was probably know to do it\nUm I don't know that they would give them the password how what do you get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find that the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud is\nJust so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording existed it somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish\n\nEncourage him to promote the kind of activity to blind shake was engaged in and bin Laden and so forth so it may be a distinction without a difference\nBut as far as the rest of the world can is concerned and the rest of Islam is concerned de emphasizing a reforming ... some it will be the same as as as telling Christians that we're going to get rid of Christ\nAnd replace him with a transgender what they just and it's been brought that to a screeching halt\nThe reforms this young friends wanted to engage in our done Fox they're done because of this\nIsn't about Trump the\nSaudis have now lost Hollywood area manual says I'm not getting any money after\nThis guy wiped out this this this teddy bear journalists Silicon Valley is running for the hills so fast you can't even see their tracks\nThis dream of a gigantic new city and Saudi Arabia built by Hollywood in Silicon valley people with all the latest tech advancements and modernization dad in its tracks\n\nSo whatever this young prince wanted to do people believed him and with this assassination of a so called journalist who's actually probably more closely tied the jihad than journalism to show the whatever the show friends wanted to do its dad\n[noise] and that's the reform of ... ... hobby is like what have been tremendous if that have happened if there had been follow through but it's all been arrested now\nThe young prince has been stopped dead in his tracks young prince is being blamed for this murder yoga France supposedly called the Fifteen hit men column in nursing white this guy out torture him nobody criticizes me\nYet there is no those who say well those are the kind of reforms he was trying to Institute get away from\nPeople thinking that the Saudi royal family would not tolerate criticism that's not who he is is what he wants people to believe but look at what people think of him now\nSo\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and they don't want any part of Saudi Arabia lining with the United states against\nYou run they don't like the Saudis in the United states ally in with Israel's nobody in the in the in the Islamic world likes is Muslim Brotherhood doesn't want any westernization off any part of the Islamic world much less Saudi Arabia\n\nAir to one runs turkey Muslim Brotherhood I mean this is who ever did books this has been whatever else it is\nThis your friends has been stopped dead in his tracks with this\nAnd the two for I think somehow trying to link Trump to it and blame him because Trump will not immediately walk away from the Saudis Trump will not dump on um trouble not canceled oil deals arms deals\nAnd because of that they're trying to say well you know Trump doesn't care if a guy died oh Trump ... about his arms money in oil and relationship with other rich guys and that's what they're trying to say about Trump because he and pump AOL will not immediately\nSigned on to the still unproven details of the death\nOf
