psychological upset is tied to them well let me put it this way\nIf we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters\nTo be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so um to see if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly ... the Democrats some of

I Can't read but she says that a family show\nAnd then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory that Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project or mental problems on to the public\nOn the politics and exactly what is happening here\nDo not underestimate that and I don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or exaggeration only make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the American but there's no other way to explain\nThis now folks to show you how to range and this is I have in the stack today I have um\nTwo maybe three one night when called teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to Kevin ... button they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the for the Democrats\nAnd much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left one of them is\nA is John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are the wet rag party you know those pieces about this piece was about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because all the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts\nThe Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers Democrats let Republicans walk\nAll over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of war says but I don't\nKnow how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sides a bunch of\n... but the fact that they do is fascinating to me now here's another such pace and we have said that\nThis woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\nShe had a piece\nOn Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates October sex since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when this stuff actually shows up in the print\nEdition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in a Saturday papers well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted and you're going to hear\nI don't know where they come from I\nDon't know who's responsible for creating molding look I think it's gender studies\nI think it's a combination of feminism and gender studies\nThat\nLiterally corrupt young minds in fact there is a there's a there's another link the piece today\nThat describes a hoax three self described leftists\nRan on after deem\nIn a nutshell three academics self described left wing ers are doing a kind of project verite costs like ... of how left wing journals except crazy studies as long as they contained the right buzz words and support leftist doctrine\nPeople are not taught\nPeople are taught this way hatred and rage and anger has to be taught or inspired or a mobilized you don't come out of the womb that's what everybody comes out of the womb smiling and happy\nNow when the baby mix of massive itself from the diaper yeah there's anger but you get my you get my point here the natural state of a human being\nIt's not rage an anger the natural state of humanity is not that as a ... by the Democratic party got that has become the Democratic party I firmly believe and I said this Friday and even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\n\nThere is not a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp\nOf approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained\nBases districts and states their enclaves which is actually a very\nSmall portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with the leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges who rule of law and there is a dirty little secret behind this\nFolks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas\nPast as laws in America\nThey have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point\nWhat they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey\nCannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nYou've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they routinely\nSoft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexandria or gift you could pass who's lunacy on display in a leftist district in New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant gap in blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when big and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some New York times\nCNN does no matter where you go there's always gonna be a story where Republicans agree it's over the Republican is deathly afraid

do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take this story seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products no power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes

caught\nIt went to trial over having sex with some under range women in the Dominican Republic he's got a ten points reelection lead Democrats don't care about that look at Bill Clinton\nTed Kennedy any number of of ah Democrats that you can point out yeah they've they've had their sacrificial lambs like Harvey Weinstein but they don't get rid of too many actual elected political people unless they are\nConvinced that getting rid of ... going to hurt some but they stand by the ones that they think they need but Kavanaugh was not even about sexual assault folks that was just\nThe uh the hook

educate our youth that someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for\nOh I just think that this is the new battlefront and ah thankfully we tromp through cannot who has put some ... on the final Republican\nUh ... true true but\nMaybe I'm maybe I'm Still waiting for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior that just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get an halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way
