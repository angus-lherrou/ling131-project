thirty one for a hot [noise]\n[noise]\nFat [noise] done [noise] I'll talk to you later [noise] flooding\nTo the program a glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off\nThe air is fascinating is they're really really really a fascinating he's one of those guys too is you know really walk through the fire for his principles and um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump down from South problem\nNot just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a ... if you will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times to visit the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go\nA low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic\n... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that's ... ... ... what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're certainly not selling themselves at the new Donald Trump's ... they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm do I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said the holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized drained but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to let a lot of\nTimes what made them almost unbeatable was for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least\nTried to hide it\nThis switch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd it ... that they would have followed Malcolm X\nThings might have been worse for Denver for a for blacks for a while\nYou back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\nYou know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews in blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I mean there was an actual death in Charlottesville right hey and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was all over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and was going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\n[laughter] they just won't recognize it ah and\nYou know who on the left standing up\nWho's standing up and go we don't want to be you know that's not us we don't want to be a part of that they just denied that it ever happened\nAnd it gives

school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political part is disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity and the global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting republic comes into office\n\nYou wonder that a state like

[noise] but she put it out and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it's\nIt's fairly common that these people on the left engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or ... or it's\nThe Democrats blue wave is drying up oh that's not to be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party and the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling questions this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely it's filled Democrat and it's in line with attorney tend to Republican members around now\nYet yet and we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave would if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows the Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people among three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote\nWithout a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning\nThe majority in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other state that they have they held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's\nLet me go state by state to show her this is all happening and ... the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional gear party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities or running in certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much there have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like ed ... hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it\nMade me in movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made then how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they persisted and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of karma guys now it's it's it's a it's a\nProcedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating a PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform\nNot the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen\nBe pro life producing a movie about something that really happened\nMass murderer he was a mass murderer of people in the womb that nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so when I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself\nTo murder the journalist\nBy Trump's anti media rhetoric Trump hates journalists and he would not react if we killed one journalist says colleague indeed so jewelry and so now with democracy all gave\nBought two
