family\nThe crown prince the each of these\nGuys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son\nIs the air now Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed then someone has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know each wind and dying the Google guys is winding

saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was this is all they have the reason that they continue to reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to do so they just keep doing the same ... and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they really hit of desperation if they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right lose it when we're silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYep threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does it they can discourage jumping up and up and they could not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans and conservatives stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what

notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to and I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry\nUh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump calling in to Fox and friends today is talking to Steve do see a doozy said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little lead other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some\nWe had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected by it we added on a great control I don't think really\nThey go to very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up that expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it dead and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's going to discuss things safe for them to make you a very dangerous they put older [noise] what is held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to being told you like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge or or they would say we\nStrongest terms oh we'd denounce rhetoric co authored by a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemn it\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I he better be careful\nWhat he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring and Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you folks\nThere are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run\nFunds who I Am convinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nWorrying economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes I laughed who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe and look at our\nPolling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve getting a little bit too cute that's all [laughter] when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now are for\nTwo percent it was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression was the worst recovery and the history of our country and a tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm paying\nInterest at irate\nBecause of our fads and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation is worried maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried\nWhen the economy's going great my whole life I've noticed and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story why\nIs a great performing and growing economies so for rent name\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people the Fed's going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully just down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump ... know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but no data that\nWay and the\nFederal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftist as they are at many financial institutions and I've got a pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much\nThey are earning as a drunk so Trump calling them out on it\nHe says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the elections so they react to it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day rollercoaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ...\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids are there are some that I Am a not at all I've always\nBecame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russia and that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump on it immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nChristians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met a share members shared\nAll our bells and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMet a share is is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into
