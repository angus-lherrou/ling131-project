the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet don't woman they have written the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New

obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nSo some senators began to say that it could well be\nSenator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and I was all the other possibilities were mentioned\nShe eventually asked for point of order the German Grassley and and ... a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this out ... re just allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff if any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but

leak it she turns or did you did you look at ... she turns back to the camera we didn't make it this is a German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say oh is this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein guess will turn around and ask her staff hey did you read this letter and nice loan nor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it with German as though case closed it wasn't us they had to have done it it

like oh no Harry the polls are tightening home I got you know well what what does that tell you what ... what\nWhat what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error\nMissouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have the best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wonder about Republican wave in the Senate in the house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican wave in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump ... an impeachment of the Democrats get the house don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake\nClones in there because they would never vote to ah to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim surely couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats do you notice the tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on you know there's a lot of talk all with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm an only get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya\nEastern very ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve\nPoint advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's what all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been

stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nHave the final turn ... stops the tape of the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you want to do it you were making bets uber guessing some of your probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a
