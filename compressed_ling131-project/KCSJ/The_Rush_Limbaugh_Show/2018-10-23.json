the foreigners at once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start in a bias Ohio David Europe first today high\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was\nListening to NPR and Steve as a reference to the mob but he didn't want to call her mom he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order of Johns and the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nThere's you know thousands of the line well and they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go back\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\nDo for we've got a bad we got a a a a bad a connection here uh about\nThe only time I've interested in NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said oh for the audience and and that happened is I get\nThe soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average\nOrdinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and ah [noise] ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day it was I Believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings I guess it does have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that gave suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an S. obey screwed Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there is no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood into\nThe American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened and we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it ... right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know on the street\nI mean they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are the peak of humanity these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nHe doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nThan these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats\nAsked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win all never gracious vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made deployed the military to the border\nAnd threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way so this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nNot worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's alive with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democratic party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourself\nIn their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mueller has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a way\nDoesn't work that you can get it it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nTo be tied\nOver there at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really don't\nWant your personality of Rush Limbaugh\nWe rush long\nAll my friends I enjoy things that are ... takes cigars for example the details are what matter same goes for simply said poems security\nTheir attention to detail and craftsmanship simply say system truly different from everything else out there it's easy to set up that it's easy to use and it works in the power outages are downed wires 'cause there are videos and there are no contracts get ten percent are simply say usa dot com that's\nSimply safe usa dot com\nYour brain is an amazing thing but

to focus on yesterday ran out of time Trump says that his administration is transgender policy\nIs to protect the country [noise]\nUh [noise] el ... friends or genders or were outraged over this and I will expertly explain why when we get back\nMore consideration to people who come from Central America than from Mexico in our asylum and an entry policy it was originally intended to dissuade people from Mexico\nFrom wanted an ally attempting to immigrate across the border\nBuddy it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people want to come into the United states to first go down to Guatemala El Salvador or Honduras and start the track from there because\nCurrent US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're a trek starts south of Michael\nAnd that's a lot of what's going on here\nBut if you in any way permit\nThis mob but to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and say come on it\nJust can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure\nBorder control a American political systems and it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like summer started we can't stop at rush we can't stop it we just got a lot of men we can't stop\nIt I I think it's ... it's almost a variation of a ... hour proven\nOr even Easter sociologists who believe that the way to really transform America the way to really get this country right is to destroy it\nBy overwhelming the welfare state just nothing as many people as possible demanding in claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse\nAnd then the left will be there to rebuild it in their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out\nAnd that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's up I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun\nIt illustrates America is by itself in wealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to share what it's not fair we have so much they have so little and they live so relatively close\nDon't doubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America or the purposes of trans forming it into the kind of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to accomplish thank goodness now\nNew York times anatomy now does not determine gender what what is this about why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population it's not even one percent here\nAnd yet it's become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American the left and the American media for what purpose\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically\nMeaningless are you kidding me determining whether somebody's male or female\nDetermined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable and needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by sensible scientists so this is the party\nOf scientists Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and support climate change\nResearch\nGeorge studied gender issues and provided health care to people\nWho do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge quote\nDr Josh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea\nThat a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male ... not necessarily\nThe same thing when you have a baby that has female genital yet but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from Mount Sinai in New York\nWe know that there are a and there is a significant durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand it in two thousand Eighteen it is hard wired it is biological it is not entirely hormonal\nAnd we don't have identified dean so we cannot specifically say that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender\nHas a in studies of twins\nIf one is transgender the other is far more likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here\nThat's also in the this is NBC News\nUS President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were in flux in that he aims to protect the country after a report that his administration was considering defining janitor as male or female based on gender tail at birth\nAnd that drew widespread condemnation\n\nTrump's that we have a lot of different concepts right now\nA lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now asked about a campaign promise to protect the L G B. T. Q. humidity Trump said I'm protecting everybody\nI Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York times on Sunday the Trump Administration would narrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth than it would be an changeable later in life\n[noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simply and yet very controversial you explain what's going on here\nThis is all politics\nPure and simple total politics disguised as something else\nThe Democrat Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities and is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks or issues in the Democratic party platform\nAnd this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population being given the whole way of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have I have long believed that\nI just didn't have a I I did not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it but I finally did\nAnd I really do believe that there are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues that are then used\nAs a as as\nThe joined a list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledged that government or deal with other government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition into an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys political issue status\nTo things that\nThat you can determine gender\nLike Jenna tail ... isn't\n\nIt received news radio I'm John Jeffries a majority of likely voters in the U.S agree with President
