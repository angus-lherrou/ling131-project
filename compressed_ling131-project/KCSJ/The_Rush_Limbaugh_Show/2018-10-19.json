everything they tend to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has\nThrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with failure\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort to get Donald Trump's approval\nNumbers down to the thirties and the twenties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior let's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about a simply waiting until Republicans lose an election such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what mothers about that is what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effective way canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box in twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they wanna destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been\nAbout having ...\nThrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not if they they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\nThat was a tool for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem\nThat's what they were trying to do\nChristine Boise for Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael I have a nominee who was then touted as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\n\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that was after investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nThe shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democrat Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and\nWhere is he now and where is the issue of gun control where is this story that young people\nHigh school and college students that had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the direct where\nIs that the day what happened\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's Syrian David Logan ... he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal Cortez these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump has are like other successful people immediate do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarm that ... where we miss hog we may want to see up nobody's saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is none of this is a real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton has affected link killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did anything wrong

bye-bye me too movement\nI mean if the ... that random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women\nClaiming her husband abused them comes up not to defend her\nGuy what good as the me too movement\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without\nThe media fanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that as my precise point Trump doesn't need the media to be who he is Trump doesn't need the media to be elected President Trump doesn't need the media to remain

back that up are you back you go I I've been way back\nThat even so uh but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one\nThing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that for this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nA that it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds wanna leave or one of these things to keep the government going that got nothing in it it burns me up\nAs all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say that these are smarter man than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding was known\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump hasn't been on the wall that Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but\nMy question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nWell that's exactly right when the moon right\nThere that was four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want if not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nThe leaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't

other things that they didn't want that he's he is a a that he's come through and he's twisted them er into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... the ... I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be gone or a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story\nOn the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having that when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince season flu tomato\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message\nBecause the\nClown roast turkey Recep Tayyip air to why he is not one of these guys that wants western influence as we look I'm way long haired have to take a break but that's the answer\nTo your what he's he didn't so many ways [laughter] ... we weren't\nChecking on Russia's log five Ninety two dot com\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women to protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends that Mahendra\nAre holding their fifth annual military ... give away the winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicle that's right a brand new read my Hendra retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my hand and you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and to get official rules is it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for the Mahendra military salute give away\nThanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive on the hindrance today at valley tractor repair in ... or call seven one nine eight five to zero two zero zero that's seven one nine eight five to zero two hundred\nPrices for these buildings all he's not a good windows ... attention all business owners who rent or at least space including storage space stop wasting your money paying someone else for your space you can now see but\nTons of money and own your own building with the incredible sale prices from general steel is right now you can save as much as half the time and cost of conventional construction and stop renting space from other ... eight eight forty one steal to see how general steel can help you save money our fifty are structural warranty buildings are\nCustom designed for your needs you can get a forty\nMy sixty foot building for less than twenty five thousand dollars for a fifty by one hundred Claire span building for under forty thousand dollars there's no wasted space in construction takes half\nThe time called eighty eight forty one steel with strong construction spending in high demand this special pricing will not last long eight eight forty one steel and get your options pricing package on dozens of building options ... forty one steel and see how general steel could save your money ...\nEight eight forty one steel that's eight eight eight for one seven eighty three thirty five eighty date for one seven eighty three thirty five\n[noise] read Russians law that fine dining Casey S.

I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone to be patient were coming\nU L quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been right\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectively side this process if I put on the spot for addiction but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer ah anti ... and Julie ... out there talking to fame and Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment than\nDeserve to lose like he's bar act on that front he's half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into his or her scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't tell those like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play has only about two or three Democrats ... totally on defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them to see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk a stuff and to me this is totally abs and um the Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers\nAre based on data that as a result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes those rights and times it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand four team and the election of two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat seven months is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them\nBut anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done to one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is does the Democrats are not when the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued to try and portray America\nAs this unfair on just on deserve\n\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative\nSo I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was\nIn predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the predominant ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh\nGetting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows so from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by their gospel\nAnd I really think um\nIf I Lived in Washington each and every I don't I

you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call um I was calling I just wanted their show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought was was just great was probably one of the best show ever hacked\nAnd really simple and you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business is you know small businesses and talk about how they're doing you know and where they are\nOr yeah yeah you know we don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties\nFolks and white collar employees were being laid off executives\nAnd magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar\nPeople and not blue collar people and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it right and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things\nLove I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were they were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now and it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because there was working in January one or or or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other three day\nThinking that but ah right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrats that stuff I mean which people and people would watch by 'em\nWell don't don't downplay the Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something ... do you think that\nPeople need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy is before they'll believe it\n\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run and operate their own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I ... I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make this country work you know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the\nVast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone well okay\nI I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I do not have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone\nAnd not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man\nWhy not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain has been laying stopping anybody from crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen and he's done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get either leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions that we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "19"}
