using an on secured private server in the basement of her home that handled thousands and thousands\nOf classified top secret communications and that that secretary of state carelessly allow those communications to be transferred to the laptop of a serial Internet crazed pedophile\nWho called himself Carlos danger can you imagine what the New York times or the smarmy leftist would think if they

going on there's a reason why conventional wisdom is taking it on the\nChin again that'd be stuffed at this point and the reason is resolved the reason is reality\nAnd it's a um\nIt's a great thing to do the audio soundbites as promised this was on the Fox news channel America newsroom good a bill hammer\nAnd Sandra Smith were hosting a round table out there was that there was a three women\nWe had Republican National committee spokesperson Kaylee ... a\nBustle dot com head of research Jessica tar love I I refer to her affectionately as Natasha on a top and Washington Free beacon a senior writer at Liz Harrington they're talking about the Patrick ... the package bombs these\nThese a mail order devices that have not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer starts off I go into came back in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nWhat I've observed a president who exhibiting leadership he condemned the attack he called for unity and then you had a response from the liberal media today ... the president's nation instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nDidn't leadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time for family planning prize that shameful I Will add that the New York times today tell us to publish an article tend to put the fascination of the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from the thigh convene delivered and how painful of New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece\nBy a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off and so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian\nAssassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the mother investigation of Trump and from what they've got to deal with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about\nCivility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying under Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump the\nMeanwhile they can call him a Nazi they can call him a Hitler or they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now isn't the Tonight Show on a top response I\nThink that the president controls himself emphatic I'd laugh at it has rally that he was poking fun\nAt the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and and this morning he tweeted that it was CNN his fault which basically is it came to a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely\n... saying that Santa Ana was responsible for that to get the\nFake news that they're spreading this is one fall but the arranged maniac that offending does\nBut I Hope of all let me just add a van and that's what they want to be on the record of metal pipe bomb showed up and not culpable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth CNN you had an anchor on that network endorsed the play in Central Park depicting the assassination and the president\nSaying that the leader right now you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump\nBlaming CNN as they can shoot because they got about neighbor she is like blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues you're now you're here to senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than a thousand things for years he recently commended that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone who got him some a lot about the\nLast what about the language of outlet and\nTime than trying to cut hair\nBrennan and CNN had a choice yesterday you saw the president come out saying is abhorrent white America to stand for black man if I Want to see an end to chat with can blame this on the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move at Fort Worth it for that fight have kept the low road President Trump put the highlights what Clinton said last week we cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have a village to be [noise] so what your hands are you in on a top actually trying to blame all all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this I'm from the high road\nAnd I'm I'm from ah I I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears Herbert just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nDeal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go alive Phil Donahue yes it is all the time Phil Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accidents have his birth you know\nI was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it made for me it if they started at stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo want to other people in the world as bold being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we\nOught to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he\nSays I'm you know ... they're marching north it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nThis department is responding to the suspicious packages that have been sent to several political
