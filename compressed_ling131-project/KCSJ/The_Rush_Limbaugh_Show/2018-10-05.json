friends this morning if there is evidence in the FBI report than other witnesses were and leaned on by allies of balls before and as well not just leaving Kaiser\nOther witnesses were Leno that means every senator has seen that every senator this read the report has seen this and it apparently isn't changing any votes of the vote was fifty one to forty nine mansion flight and Collins\nAll voting yes but the final vote cannot happen by Senate rule\nBefore for forty two pm eastern time tomorrow has to be thirty hours after this vote was taken\nNow I Want to\nSay I'm not surprised by it Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the vote now going to not get a change I mean if if the cloture vote and we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\n\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comments not just on social media but so the offices that are many Republican senators are getting their\nBeing Daewoo used their entire families are being threatened\nTheir grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened it's enormous ... is never ending the phones\nDon't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in is on the ... it is vile and it is evil and it's not just like\nAn columns and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have to be\nCredited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mob squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for Kavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threat to these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this was his final term\nOr the easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious wave\nHe is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator from\nMaine I Can't describe for you you might\nHave an idea you're probably know the things that are being sent to these people the rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society it's unhinged much of it\nIs is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I Believe constitute now the mainstream of the Democrat Party the protestors are paid\nTheir signs are all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've ever received threats and I don't know if you've been ... by them\nBut if you have an if you believe them they can honor view\nAnd yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be\nNow they're thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't vote yes on the procedural vote this morning\nIf for intention is to vote no down the road if you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions can be hoisted up\nAnd used in ... and I think we're in we're in a brand new territory here for a number of reasons\nI don't think you can say that just because Susan Collins and voted yes this morning means a guarantee she's going to vote yes tomorrow and then why make a statement at three o'clock why why make some ... why three o'clock and why make some statement I Try to keep my\nShe'll announced her decision on whether she'll again vote

months I haven't made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and its designs is founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of

meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America man so\nWhy did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate

[noise]\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism\nSocialism does not work well with self reliant

is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons at tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book is famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant\nAnd it just the nature of things and so\nThey're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding\nNot just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited\nMost\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence\nBase here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men that\nReminds me hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of that but I Do but it would you be every bit of six and seven [noise]\n[noise] ... quote\nKavanaugh has no avenue of appeal do except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\nAnother ... code\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime\nWith the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege he used a sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long ... he blah burned like a newborn as plot ... his career you see\nHe hasn't had a series of goals in a gym for them all know that guy is a dangerous schemer he has plot and they get on the Supreme Court where he can rule\nSome of the force of on the yacht and became the ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis\nThis is what this clown saw in the Kavanaugh hearings but you know the reference as a single phrase my Thomas Jefferson the public life is about life liberty pursuit of happiness the fulfillment of the white American man's desires\nAssumed the force of the meeting and automatic\nAnd became the ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis bingo these people prove me ride each and every time I go analyzing them\nSo the trouble with America is it it was established by white men for white man and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd life and liberty was only intended for white man and if any white man was instructed in the pursuit then there was something wrong with America\nDo not minimize this I'm telling you this belief is animating the last two generations informing the last two generations of kids going to high school and college this is the kind of dribble that they are being taught\nThat America is corrupt from its founding days that it was founded for an exclusive group of people white man nobody else need apply\n\nAnd when they don't get their way in other words when minorities start taking over\nWhat she knows lesbians and gays transgender you name

advance it must be at someone else's expense\nNo no no ... and that's what people are doing I'm merely chronicling what's happening out\nThere it is on the ... I just shared with you one of the countless examples like inside this guy Michael list uh\nIn the New Yorker suggesting that Kavanaugh's crying because he's a white man targeted singled out for advancement in America by other white men and when it's not going his way breaks down and cries\nThis piece justifies the attack on white men it says it's about time\nThe whole country and the assault on the whole country is validated because it's actually an assault on a white male majority which has caused tyranny and sadness and misery and death and destruction for everybody else\n[noise] oh I said was\nWomen are angry me too movement women are angry something's happened to them their range an anger they take out now in the country the majority of which white\nChristian man that's the

you you what Trump allude in any way to women's time of the month on all hell is going to break loose\nBut here misery even get to talk about on his lowest common and every day and everybody gets everybody understands it\nAnd everybody knows what it means it means to stay away leave it alone don't engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bucks or whatever and go on\nShe did this\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley\nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is adamant\nThis week the turtle and ... have been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer remind US Senator Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e M Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly what producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations I don't know what other inference we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence\nThat the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls e Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWell her warriors did and that she had seen the therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed the legislature we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your reviewers old but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nAs a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must be it\nYou must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy notes the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the officers and Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried W Ramirez Julie sweating the representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his what\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever\nI mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of college in general the violation and I\nShouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones infant disease on it or are they the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member things are coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kevin ... before that\nWas during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nFit to be tied now I think I have some might relate to it I got an email last night from Salinas Ito\nWho has made a name for herself by traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't save and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a note from\nLast night and she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there\nIn these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six saying that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand sixteen that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the capital circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nSome restrictions apply for a complete details as much actually dot com\nCheck out Russia slot at five tiny KPSK dot com the word Rush Limbaugh [noise]\n\n\nAh welcome back to have you with Russia and the service of humanity and hunters who wait two to eight eight to opt in Christine Woolsey Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein Leyland at Kaiser is referred to as a\nHeat late when Kaiser is one of the ... the ex wife Bob Beck all in the letter to Feinstein\nLeyland Kaiser is referred to as a he'd this has led the analysts do believe that for didn't write the letter Ford would know that we ... would presumably no that Leland Kaiser is not a man\nIf we can Kaiser is one of the ... best buttons and she would know she's a woman but she's refer to as a heat\nSo now we're back to Monica McLean balls ease buddy who helped her write a letter from her home in robot Delaware\n\nGuess what McLean is a former FBI agent said to have worked as a spokesperson for for Preet Bharara Preet Bharara former staffer for Senator Schumer he went on to become us attorney southern district for New York so Trump fired him\nAnd uh and now he is one of the biggest never Trump or is out there\n... lawyer is David Law firm in front of the archives the Washington Post February ... this guy was instrumental in the process the way it was the prosecutor\nIn in charge of a well there's [noise] living to hang on let me complete the\nDogs when I got back President Trump has taken credit for solving the NFL's problem with Canada broadcasting

it is affirmed nothing\nChanges and that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking courts that could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska

is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein looks like she is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand that she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\n\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those would be watching under dental camp do you see\nThe pain the expression on the face of Murkowski\nAnd the expression of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of die for\nAnd I will have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it

here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's been a really pained look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for\n[noise] [noise] I don't know when the\nPicture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we

he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn what is a Democrat and doing saying that he would vote to confirm capital this was in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red and Aubrey just wants to win and so forth but\nThis he expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling\nData this is ... seats And Corker by the way has also tweeted today that it is outrageous to punish somebody you haven't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose an actions are men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the court because of that and then\nThe next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperament temperament and then we're going to deny because he committed perjury and I'm going to deny him because he threw ice in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKavanaugh shouldn't be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action but wasn't one of the world are we going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have it\nEngaged in it\nOh we've got to make up for lost time the left those Phil breed is and\nWho is starting to lose grounds fall behind black ... in the race to replace Corker\nCenter stands on
