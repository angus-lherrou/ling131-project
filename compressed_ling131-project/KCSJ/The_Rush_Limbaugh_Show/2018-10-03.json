have you ever hear Rush Limbaugh doing what I was born\nInto [noise] hosting the most listen to radio talk show in the country and there's a\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where that got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left is infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened why it doesn't matter what the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\n\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with that this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do it got Trump out there they claim is mocking balding forty wasn't mocking are\nWell I I\nStand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God\nThis is only acceptable I don't know why president that he did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's deserve even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her whether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or otherwise orbit differences the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want he understands that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times and it's been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what\nOne word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess what I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit\nIt was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia at ten for bad yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was a totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did was make up the line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat ... not so now they're on to something else\nActually a ... or something somebody said and James borrow things mostly are too young to remember\nBottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman comes Florida political environment\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi and said don't remember\nThe Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nYou never know what you do when you got about ... what you want to come up with what you're gonna come to you going to come up with the women like New Hampshire are great\nBut it's not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience to know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kavanaugh protester was confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they don't want to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her\nBest friend who says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it protester\nSo you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept a non corroborated charge to destroy them\nBut he's life if you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated we wiped that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor oh no no wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\n... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie no not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at the standard that many people are in jail for west\nSo what ... ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I'd know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat somebody has to have much to say\nRush probably ... being met work read Russian blog five Ninety\nLaw ...

have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played ride along and without ahead Rachel Mitchell ask personal questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what the purpose was\nUm all\nTrump this is reminding everybody what\nShe said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford now Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about

dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it\nThan moving to the right to oh he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans having Trump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how blindly insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nIn Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so what was the horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nThey just simply boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant white at not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel\nJoined by a so called movement called me to work all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men\nYou know organized for the express purpose\nOf destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine organized movement the male version of me to\nWill\nRush or ... women are nor do their research we well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant plus oh but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made fun up in the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nPresident Trump's remarks about Brett Kavanaugh's accuser are being condemned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle at a rally last night Trump mock Christine Blasey Ford she claims that the Supreme Court nominees sexually assaulted her more than Thirty years ago but doesn't remember all the details so that minority leader Chuck Schumer says joking about that is despicable\nI've been disappointed by President Trump's comments before\nBut this is a new low President Trump should apologize immediately\nRepublican senators Jeff Flake and Susan Collins said Trump's comments were appalling the Senate Judiciary committee chairman want some documents from Christine Blasey Ford my power has the story\nGrassley saying that Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys should support her sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh by delivering notes from her therapy sessions recordings of the lie detector test she took and exchanges she had with reporters Grassley said more evidence was needed to evaluate the allegations before voting on the nomination of President Trump's Supreme Court pick\nPresident Trump is blasting the New York times to report

from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about sex at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the\nRare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written bandages actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that ... or the individual that did something to be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this uh ... well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be here but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up\nPeople who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their sink is\nBecause the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether boys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go into girls' bathrooms\nAnd becomes legitimate that's sick\n... ... in in many not that Pacific way but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various\nAgendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so\nWhen our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's\nThe same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black convict is in is\n\nIn every instance here points to the country as large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who was the one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply ... I did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened like they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record in the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea of a mock she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming he mocked Christine walls before\nAnd here it is is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target up attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd man by the way they vote or do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr ... testimony and this and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old from I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yeah\nIt can be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nWho are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know we had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nGet away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned women\nStudies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist\nBut it's entirely possible at the same time after him that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe\nThat men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um ah you're right sexual that consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you know the hook up better right by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get notarized after the date\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush Limbaugh ... voice on the right Tom but either way I see Mitt\nRene

C. S. G. I. D. J.\nLo and I are doing\nMy id say dot com on your phone when our our last\nNight when he appeared to mock Christine for the kids that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in high school\nIt has been since Trump was inaugurated even during the transition it's been a series of steps or efforts\nTo get rid of Donald Trump to overthrow the election results of two thousand sixteen and I think Christine balls the Ford is an\nElement of that whole movement or that whole desire the Democratic party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the F. B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\n\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here to there the objective of\nThis was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know this this may screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate\nNone of blue wave in North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the\nDemocrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators would win out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nOther words these three Heitkamp Donnelly market what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to like and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed\nIn fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven polling has been gun\nHeading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski but if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump's sand last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now since Trump's\nOn the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence\nOn public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates the varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ball the says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story dates column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July sixth of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and there's the apps\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists as they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSalt the charge here in China tried served a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some\nAh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred in the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nAnd heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\n\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to\nThese changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nHurt changing story leaves her short\nOn credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes at her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of any two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that presidents should alert or your phones that are ... yeah I forgot that weren't you'll
