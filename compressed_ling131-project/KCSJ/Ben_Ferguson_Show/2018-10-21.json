that they're breaking the law as going into Mexico and when this when they got stuck on this bridge and Mexican authorities stopped them I Will give them a lot of credit for that right there\nThey knew they were breaking the law to Mexico that's why they were stopped on the bridge\nBut this is very much political they're being supported by people politically to do this they are being inspired by people to do this or they're they're they're clearly have resources to do this\nFunds to do this and people say well where's the money coming from I'm not sure I don't know I don't really care there are a lot of people saying follow the money and that's fine you can't I don't care where the money's coming from because the money has nothing to do with the principal and the principal is a simple principle\nThe ... the principal is that you cannot just come into this country illegally and just say oh I Want to seek asylum it doesn't work that way and and what you're saying here with this ... this coming this is a this is clearly\nA a well thought out caravan meant to have political purposes meant to have political things behind it\nAnd it's a problem for me there are new pictures that have just been released tonight to say that and these latest numbers from Mexico caravan uh many are now saying it's over ten thousand and that has risen significantly today a\nDecember on friday was about four or five thousand is what they thought now it is staggering how much bigger this group has swelled up well beyond the five thousand they're vowing to reach the United states America this is something that many of actually said that they're trying to\nGet this journey to the ride around election day to make Republicans and Donald Trump look\nLike they're terrible people where they'll show up right before the election\nAnd\nThey will show up right before the election and when they do show up right before the election and we turn them away or we arrest people then they're going to exploit that for political gain in the mid term elections\nNow\nI'll get your phone calls on this and see what you think ah I don't believe that this is traditional seeking asylum I Do believe that there are some sad stories in this group\nI don't think that you should be able to come into this country illegally\nI think when you get into care of and the swelling the way this caravan is swelling I start to have some serious questions with your motives I have some serious questions about the politics behind this you know that you're breaking the laws and you continue to move forward and you can ... can continue to do it I have some real problems with that as well\nSo let me go to your phone calls and see what you think about all of this the number one eight hundred\nFor seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred\nFor seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mobile dot com phone lines are open or get your thoughts your reaction to this simple question is\nDo you believe that these individuals should be given asylum in this country the arguments 'til after saying is that any person that's willing to make this type of trek\nAny person who's willing to make this type of uh of effort to get here clearly is desperate and seeking asylum and therefore deserves it now I also do not believe that this was anything but a political ... move by many involved many that are supporting this\nUm group of illegal immigrants are heading towards this country and they want this to be synchronized with the mid term elections I'm telling you right now this is all about the mid term elections make no mistake about it it is about\nThe mid term elections and everybody needs to understand that\nI don't believe that this has anything to do with truly wanting asylum are seeking asylum in general most people would not do it this way why would you getting a massive caravan that you know it was on national news you know is already being stopped\nBy Mexico on this bridge for two days and keep coming the chances of being successful are very slim and it's being cruel yearly stated that the chances are ... America's saying you turn around we're not letting you in\n\nThat's what America's saying America's sang turnaround we're not going to let you in\nThey know this\nThey know that America is saying we're not letting you in\nMexico as even pretty much made that clear to them that look where America is not going to let you in so then it's Mexico's problem I guess at that point but I don't think this is about coming into America as much as it is about the PR nightmare that's what I honestly think I think this is honestly uh the the night mayor\nOf uh the PR nightmare that this will put and maybe it would change the elections and I think that's why a lot of people are inspired to actually be involved in this they're inspired to be involved in it because they think All right this could change the election America and then maybe I Will get asylum\nMaybe if I if we change the election then we can get the is the the asylum that we want\nThen maybe we'll get exactly what we want one eight hundred four seven\nFour nine seven three two and they keep saying that these are refugees I'm going to stop saying that the restaurant I I'm going to call it what it is a group of illegal immigrants that looks to be ten thousand strong and growing\nThat is what this actually is this is a group of illegal immigrants that is coming to America to break into our country illegally\nThat is what this is everybody needs to understand that that is what this is one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two and should the military be used once they get there if they're going to try to cross\nPeople said the military is not the way to do this to be a humanitarian effort\nThat we should allow liberals and liberal groups that go to the border and care for these people they shouldn't be worried about being a you know a salted I've even seen by the U.S military and who said the military is going to salt in the military because they know sorry you can't come in this country\nI Do believe that when you have ten thousand people coming towards your country\nThe military has an obligation a duty to get involved that I Do believe now you may disagree with me and I'll go to your phone calls one eight hundred for seven for nine\nSeven three to let me go to Charlie thanks are wedding Charlie you're on the bench for August and show how Charlie go ahead\nMan show a this is not immigration this is an invasion\nAnd I think the president by law has the right to do whatever you need to do to prevent this set in the military down to the border and stop this crap once for all my ten thousand people\nSense they seem like an angry mob coming toward your country and go ahead and try to stop this you won't be able to\nYeah and they may not be armed traditionally the way out of a military campaign is armed but they are armed they're armed with all sorts of long headed thinking that are that we know are going to be used to underline the values of this country ... it's ... it's a military ...\nNot in the traditional sense of military campaign but it is it it's certainly a campaign it's funded it's scheduled\nAnd ... and it ought to be characterized as an invasion and we and he Donald Trump is right on the money when it comes to have enough a military presence and if necessary uh you know then that we're gonna have to use military force if they if they don't get the message any other way\nYou know one of the things gym that I think is interesting is is that you know I most most people when I'm and I want to get your take on this do you have problems with refugees coming in this country as long as they do it's a legal way\nAbsolutely not I think that our ... our immigration system is clearly broken we need to straighten it out we needed to straighten out for for Fifteen Years um and and the enemies of this country I have been using this broken system\nTo to to further their purposes and their aims for a long time and a ... immigration is what this country is all about\nThe ... are the the power of of America comes from people who wants to be free and who\nAnd I asked this question why is it that there are other people to try to find the right way that are going through at the right way okay we're going and doing it the right way why should\nThese ten thousand plus get to move ahead of them\nJust because they broke into our country to bend Ferguson show\nMuch more after this caught A R P I found\nOut just how liberal AARP was about a month ago and it shocked me did you know they are supporting to keep Obamacare the law the land did you know they're fighting against almost every legislative agenda that Donald Trump's in favor of well if you're a member of Arab ...
