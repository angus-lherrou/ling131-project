and you lie and you say if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor and that's cause if you like you're pointing keep your plan that false than you think politicians should be in trouble for that\nI absolutely I think\nThey are now to count her out of that is designed it right and then the counter side that has this\nUm and I get your point but then they would say\nWell what if you promise vote for me and I'm going to lower crime but then crime goes up three months later do you have to pay a fine for that you get my point I mean you and and and you'd have the politicians who would be the ones that would be directing the the the fines back and forth which also scares me if you'd weaponize those fine\nOh it certainly has to be in a similar to the IRS where that is non

now says that Trump that has created the atmosphere for political violence saying it's it's really trumps fault people need to understand that this is actually\nAll Trump's fault\nThe President Trump in response to this horrific shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue issued a sweeping condemnation of violence in anti Semitism um do you are you satisfied with how he's responded to this tragedy\nRole I think his response to the tragedy is was appropriate but there's something much bigger than that going on here which is the atmosphere that he's created and if the Republican Party has created in terms of political violence\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene but you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs ... and we see it in voter suppression\nWe see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning for more than that we see it in a president who doesn't ... who is been breaking the law systematically as a candidate as a business person and as a president\nSo a Republican would argue or you say that Tom but\nThere was a capital there was a shooting of a Republican members of Congress last year by a it seemed to Bernie Sanders supporter or what appear to be toxic substances or or folks toxic substances have been sent to\nDonald Trump junior and his family Senator Susan Collins that it's not just Republican lawlessness here what would you respond to that day\nI Would say there has been bad behavior on both

House President Trump rode\nOn Thursday a Medicare or a significant change the Medicare when it comes to prescription drug pricing\nHaving a drug based on the price has paid and\nOther advanced industrial countries is a huge change that's going to save money for a not only the government which means us the tax payers end for millions of Medicare beneficiaries\nSo it's going to be a campaign issue and I want you to know what is true and what is not true and why this can be so good for so many Americans joining me now to talk about that a stream of Burma should a minister and for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I appreciate you\nComing on tonight this was a significant move by the White House to lower drug prices for millions of Americans\nThat's exactly it and and let me just give you some background first so we were released a report yesterday as well and it can cost up our prices for the most costly position administered drugs that are covered by Medicare part B\nWhat it showed is that on average the United states is paying a hundred and eighty percent more and in some cases more than a four hundred percent more\nThan the international average so this means that the Medicare program and our beneficiaries are spending you know just a lot more than other countries have to pay for their drugs and\nI think that some of the issue with how the Medicare program is set up and the way we pay for drugs and part B which is a physician administered drugs are drugs that you get in the doctor's office is that we're essentially just a price taker there's absolutely\nNo negotiation that goes on and we don't get discounts and also the way we're paying doctors for this as well is that there's a perverse incentive for doctors because they actually get paid more if they are prescribing higher price drive\nAnd so what the president has said and he's been very committed to lowering drug prices and we've heard him talk about this and he's delivering on his promise and what we did is we put together a proposal\nAnd we want to hear comments on our proposal but the idea here is to essentially phase in\nUh the prices that are being offered overseas and face those in for our Medicare beneficiaries to that over a five year period our prices would drop on average by thirty percent so this would be savings to the taxpayer about Seventeen point two billion dollars\nAnd for Medicare beneficiaries it would be about three point four billion dollars\nAre gonna keep doctors whole we're just going to pay for drugs in a different way so that we take out that incentive\nUm to prescribe higher price drugs and we're just going to be paying them a flat rate essentially to administer these drugs but they are going to be kept whole\nThis is not going to impact patient access to medications in any way but what it will do for patience is lower their prices\nYou know one of the questions I Know I'm going to get to hear from people as well how was that the rest of the world is paying such a different price for these prescription drugs than we are and why did it take so long to to make this change\nYeah and that some of the the the way the Medicare program is set up and this is why I get very concerned when I hear calls for Medicare for all because the reality is there are just problems in the in the Medicare program today\nAnd it's it's what is written into law and essentially what it says is that we're going to pay the average sale price a six percent\nSo there's really no room for negotiation and because of that we're seeing prices go up and up um you know I can tell you from where I sit at my desk I'm staying price tags of almost a million dollars for some drugs that are coming out and so we ... we can't afford it and the worst part about it is that\nUh people overseas and other developed countries um are paying much lower prices and so it's time\nUh that America not be paying for innovation and for the entire world and that the the rest of the world also a contributing to the cost of innovation and drug development and it's it's it's time that we stopped Americans being taken advantage of\nMy guess would be same of Irma she is the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I've met so many people to hear the word change they get nervous they think grabbed to sign up for this drive to change something\nOr is this going to be automatic for people in Medicaid\nIt is automatic for patients it should really be absolutely seamless are not going to feel any change except for when it comes time to open up their wallets and pay the bell and that's when they'll feel the difference there they don't need to sign up for anything there are most people are already paying their part B premiums\nAnd so what we hope to see happen is that they're going to see lower prices at the pharmacy counter and you know over time this could impact their premiums and they can see those go down as well but it doesn't take a than taking any active steps\n... this was a obviously huge information for so many millions of Americans are on Medicare and Medicaid services or the deal with those things that's when the president did this on Thursday if people want to get more information about this uh we're can they go to find out more\nThat's exactly it you can find more information at

country she says people using free speech is the shield to hurt people is not America\nTook him took him literally three seconds every started talking to blame the president\nYou know well he got it right but there's a bigger thing happening here which is the president United States of America this is what he's doing okay I I go back to what I said in that there's just proof of it right there\nYou want to know what the midterms about everything is the president's fault that as a strategy the Democrats in the midterms\nYou have a horrific anti Semitic shooting that takes place clearly the president loves people that are Jewish his own daughter a convert to Judaism his son in law is Jewish or his in laws are Jewish I mean this is a man that that is loves Jewish people but it's his fault they were just shooting\nIt's it's it's actually his fault this is a guy who divided the country and I'll say it again if you support the president nine states of America\nAnd you stand behind them and you're proud I Want you to share but now if you disagree with them and when you're at the angry face you're watching it on Facebook Live and I want to get your phone calls from all over the country one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mode I count phone lines are open now that's not all the time had to say\nSo he implies that well this is basically Donald Trump's fault that we have the shooting a synagogue and then listen to what he says\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene what you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs and we see it in voter suppression we see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning\nI mean there's so many records you says lawlessness okay so the lawless and so many of the street you have a president Donald Trump that wants to secure the border and doesn't want to care available to break into this country\nYou didn't say that the president's kidnapping these children is the words of Jim Carrey you didn't come out and say that this is the party of lawlessness which is actually advocating for law and order\nDonald Trump is advocating for law and order easy law and order candidate he's advocating for there to be structure in our laws he's advocating for there to be a people not voting illegally and illegal immigrants not signing up to vote in places like California illegally and able to vote in local elections when they're not even a citizen\n\nAnd you want to say this is an issue of lawlessness that this the president is advocating for lawlessness and when he does advocate for the last to be enforced like securing our border you didn't say that he's he's a big it is a racist\nHe's an evil person because he's not letting people break into this country you just said you didn't want lawlessness and then you advocate for a while as soon as all week long by advocating for people coming into this country doing this in a ... and a way that this law last\n\nEight hundred for seven for nine seven three to you know I don't believe that the president at fault and I'll give you an example\nI don't think that because somebody sends bombs in the mail this week and and was a Trump supporter that that's the president's fault the same way\nThat the Utah man that was charged for sending toxic letters to Trump and other administration officials I don't believe that it's the fault of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Hillary Clinton Rocco bomber Eric Holder\nBy the way this is what the media was not focused on this week so I'll tell you the story because they were only focus on somebody that was a Trump supporter sending pipe bombs and didn't explode thank goodness and they completely didn't talk about another man who did something very close to this\nAnd his political motivations because it didn't fit their narrative federal authorities\nSecurity the indictment on Thursday against the man accused of sending threatening letters to top U.S officials including a rice

country then they go out and said Donald Trump is kidnapping children\nThat sound like unification not so much doesn't sound like unification Adel\nDo as I say now is I Do Democrats want to blame Donald Trump for the crazy man that went out there and did horrible things this week by sending bombs that people but they don't cover the undercover the liberal man who sent rights and to the president rice in to the FBI Director rice and to the secretary of defense\nDouble standard they didn't say well should we hold Democrats accountable for what was said nope won't say worried about
