Republicans in a sprint to the mid term elections\nOr John the president is largely making the midterms about his agenda and arguing that vote for any Democrat is a vote against the things the president wants to get done in this next week the president plans to hit the campaign trail out west in Montana where Republicans are hoping to pick up a seat in the Senate\n\nDemocrats are upset\n\nThat a black man by the name of Kanye West as not supporting the people that they told him\nTo support think about that\nAnd when he supported the president they first said he was an Uncle Tom\nThen they said we would we would we would shame him health shame him and just saying that he's mentally on well clearly this is the person is mentally on well then they said that the president's taking advantage of a mentally on well man\nThen you had people on TV who are African\nAmerican who went on TV and said this about cognac tell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nYou've heard that right I'm going to play it again this is what African Americans\nWho are Democrats set on national TV about Kanye West because Kanye West disagrees with them politically so now they just bully him by saying tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nYou heard that right Tanya anyway I says what happens when negroes don't read\n\nAll because Kanye West's likes Donald Trump\n\nNow here's my analogy I Know there's going to be people on the left that are going to freak out by me saying this and before you again don't tweet at me until after I finished the statement because if you tweet at me before I finished the statement I Will not respond because clearly you're ignorant and you're not listening\n\nHis is not the perfect example of a modern day version of slavery what they're doing the Kanye West is this on a perfect example\nOf what slave owners did two slaves to keep them in their lane of slavery\n\nTiny west as a black guy Kanye West back in the day said George Bush hates black people remember that Mr producer can you grab that audio do you mind doing that\nKanye West was a guy that after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser and said George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then\nThere wasn't a white Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards tell you what is what happens when they grow don't really\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nI Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from the car sellers now when Kanye West says this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say that tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read no you didn't hear you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no because we've got employees that are black working in the schools and were unions teachers and you can't destroy public edge for education I Would agree with that you can you've already done some possible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue that the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation that keeps them in modern day slavery\nAnd so what happened was as you have a I I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro who went from living on the plantation miss producer wants to play the audio get this is Kanye West's while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great white man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that you're on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation then\nThe ... comes out in ... and start singing for himself and search realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm seeing massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm seeing a kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party\nHe starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there I don't know you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id how races that mentality\nAnd then Tania says you know what I I I'm going to be independent of independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate it all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs the African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then they reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read how is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist because the black person said is it not racist because\nIt's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's tweets are are are horrible\nThe same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets\nAbout this ... national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and that we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you tell us what happens when they grow don't read\nI Want to get in here and get

evening depending on where you are around the country [noise]\n[noise] was\nTold that he is nothing more than a negro that doesn't read\nThat's right\nBy other African Americans who mocked and made fun of him after he met with the president\nOf the United states of America\n\nAll because he became a Republican and started thinking for himself I'm not sure you could say became Republican but as soon as he met with Trump this is this is what they say about him\nWas his what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with men take pictures\nThere it is and take pictures and take pictures\n\nYou walk off the Democratic plantation\n\nHas a black man and you say anything that's outside of the lane of being a ... a hardcore Democrat and they will say you don't read and call you a negro\nIs what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures\nPolitical that God [laughter] I'd rather than\nBlack folks are about to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with habits and he's an attention for like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be fatal Tanya what seriously you clearly has issues he's already that\nHe clearly has issues and he's been hospitalized\nWow\nYou know I thought Democrats are the ones that were in favor of having more help for mental health issues and not shaming people in mental health not bowling them on mental health\n\nI thought that I thought they were the party that was supposed to be loving and understanding unless you get off their plantation\n\nLet me remind you of something that happened this last week just to compare and contrast that to differences\nAnd [noise] they were swept came out for the American idol reticent when I Lived in the teeth or think fast congresswoman for more than a decade\n\nTerrified her\nAnd Democrats said look at Taylor Swift look at this grave role model look at this hour for independent woman look at this brave independent woman\n\nKanye West comes out for Donald Trump\nHe's quote a token negro mentally ill and an Uncle Tom\n\nTell me how that's not jacked up\n\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mobile dot com phone lines are open Ben you're on the bench for August and show nice to have you with us and I go ahead\n\nOh quick things about this whole ... thing um\nYou're framing this and such a way that it sounds as if the left is calling Kanye mentally unstable just because she became a Republican support Donald Trump\nSoon as he started hanging out what let's be clear as soon as he started hanging out with Donald Trump or the ... back in two thousand sixteen when he met with him before he was inaugurated that's when the first political individuals' started saying well clearly he's mentally ill\nBecause that's a way to undermine someone and and and that's the reason why you would say that the same reason why all these democratic ah commentators\nAll of a sudden became doctors on national TV saying well clearly as mental issues clearly he has mental health problems clearly he needs to go ... you know seek mental health\nOr help from others clearly has frenzy to talk to him and it's all because he's saying something that they don't like when he said George Bush doesn't like black people after Hurricane Katrina remember that\nWhen he said George Bush doesn't like black people they said he was a hero they didn't need to go check himself in the mental health rehab\nWell let's look at the context of this most recent meeting where Tanya himself said that he's been diagnosed with bipolar\nDisorder that he is sleep deprivation and he was talking about alternate universes I mean what who would go into\nThe ... in contact in context what will in context what was he referenced the we talked about alternate universes\nHe ah I Can't remember exactly\nWho I can tell you it was talking about the politics of people living an alternate universes which I've said a million times that made it on my part in the shoes\nOf somebody else in an alternate universe and so on and so forth\n... though he will do that in politics all the time every politician that runs for office so I mean talk to you got Congressman Steve Cohen democratic congressman who has been screaming for Donald Trump to impeach said and I quote I vote with the conscience\nOf a black grandmother\nNo one said he was mentally ill when he said that over and over again why is running for office in fact you were cheered by the black community for saying that as a white guy who is Jewish you can't get any farther than that from a black grandmother\nStill seems like a bit of an abstract concept to be talking about when you're discussing things with the president when you could be focusing on policy ...\nOkay so here's what I'll say battle to I'm fine I'm fine if you don't like how the meeting\nWith okay if you think the meetings should have gone differently if you think the conversation should have gone differently I'm fine with that but don't you think it's incredibly you're responsible\nTo to bully and shame someone because of their political beliefs to the point where you say that they're mentally insane and that they don't read do you mean by car sellers at the top Democrat on the African American side who I debate often on TV\nHas criticized me for all sorts of tweets that tweeted out\nNot nothing kudos", "show_name": "Ben Ferguson Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "14"}
