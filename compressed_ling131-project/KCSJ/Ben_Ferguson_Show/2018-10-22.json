you know job why are you going to get that job\nIt was it's a simple system but it's a you know it's up to you you don't want to flush peoples and ... when they come here\nAnd the only ambition that most of those people have is to go on welfare that's the only ... yeah I mean as a human being\nAnd as you just put it don't go on welfare don't have a backup plan\nAmen to that great point and I appreciate the phone call one eight hundred\nFor seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to\nAnd say thank you for having me I I Want to I Want to ... a lot less that\nUm you know people are coming to this country for a reason whether they're trying to seek asylum or whatever the situation is the thing is with those people are coming to take care of it we don't know the ... we haven't had any real\nData or information to say these people are here trying to do this just to do a political stunt or they're actually come to the country because they're trying to get up on them all up there trying to go out with all the countries where the law is is so far behind\nWhat we can be recovered handle on it so I mean you almost have to understand why they're real and take the risk\nWell I doubt they're willing to take the risk but I also think that if we do allow people into this country then you're in that what you're doing is I think you're incentivizing people to take these risks that could cost in their lives and their kids' lives\nYou know there may be some security in the numbers of how many people were there right there may be some security\nIn the press sit there that's following them a ... and for the stability that comes with people supporting them along the way because this caravan is a caravan that's being followed by the international press they're all following them they are all telling their stories they're all trying to make you feel sorry for somebody\nI mean that that's something that they are clearly trying to do\nA ... they're trying to humanize and to basically make you feel like there's no way you could say no there's no way that you could say\nA this is wrong you know that that that that you know you're you're somehow evil if you say I want you to be able to do it the right way or you should be doing it the right way and and so if you do let them all and then what does that say the rest of the world it's going to you're going to have a lot of people that probably be be taken advantage of by coyotes\nPeople that may lose their lives you have to\nI Believe you must\nRespond\nWhen clearly showing that this is not how we work in this country so don't take the risk don't take the journey don't take the track because if you do you are wasting your time\nBut the thing of it is a lot of those people are on education they don't they don't even\nKnow what they're coming into they do not even know that there's a possibility that can be military force when they hit the border that they're going to be deported immediately that they may be sent back to the countries where they could be I mean as far as we know that could be murder for going back to their own countries\nWe don't know yeah the whole situation and you know me personally I Know people who come here illegally from El Salvador while I'm all it is bad I mean what they do their children what the government does to their children what government people in employees\nAnd please do I have no ... it's what I said before I have no doubt that if I was poor and living in one of those impoverished countries that I wouldn't want out\nI have no ... you know you could argue that their conditions while traveling this country are probably on par with the conditions they live then if they stay in their homes for their or their hearts or whatever it may be where they're coming from\nRight because it's so bad I I don't think it's much worse on the road for them so it doesn't seem to be so there you know us doing this you'd say there's no way I'm going to go walk two thousand five hundred I don't I don't think we\nShould open our doors and say you know everybody just come on and and we're going to be free everything now first off I like to know who who's give me that data that they go right on welfare because I've lived in South west Missouri and central Kansas and\nYou know they have children legally born in the U.S they are us citizens I don't like you have a problem with that right but and us taking care of the citizens but the parents they get nothing\nThe kids you know yeah we put them in school and we give them that little two dollar lunch when they're in school but my go home they have nothing the parents what worked the\nJunkiest jobs they can get because they can't get regular jobs because they weren't so dirty numbers you know you got got give you their hats off to them because they're willing to put up with our beach\nAs far as way of life but to them it's better than going back to what they came from\nAnd I I Will say a lot of ... ... ... and ... their ...\nNo let me get the point out real quick I Know that there's people who thought they were trying to do it legal trying to go to a a a a immigration attorney and pay him or her thousands of dollars and got taken advantage of by because they weren't even legal attorney but there are so\nLow that there's always there's always people David out there that can be swindle you and I know that and that's unfortunate but that again is not my problem what we should have is consistency ... world ... word travels very

seven three to five three five nine seven three to the eight hundred number one eight hundred and four seven\nIt should've been at least fifty percent done the ... the Republicans have dropped the

win in the midterms I knew everything they do have a full blown open border\nYeah for sure oh they don't please don't talk about the ah the\nCities where they housed all these legal or you know that

takes to remain in power\nAnd you'll do leave the Democrats but some of the Republican and that we use that they don't care really about us\nYou know the the the people that have worked in this

I'm about an issue that is um you know these migrants they keep calling them come in this country this is political do not buy into the idea that it's not political it is\nAbsolutely political every part everything about this political every part of this is political everything that's going on with this is political everybody needs to understand that it's political everybody needs to comprehend that this is\nPolitical\nThey're hoping that this is going to be a disaster they're hoping that this is going to blow up in our faces they are hoping that this is going to be something where people are going to sit there and go oh my gosh\n\nI Can't believe this is happening oh my gosh I cannot believe that this is going down all my gosh look at how the Republican Party is training Donald Trump sent the military to the border that is so unfair\nThey should have never done that how terrible them to do that how awful it if they did that everybody should be ashamed that this happened that's what they're hoping for\n\nSo let's get to your phone calls on this and see what you think the number one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to Paul in Alaska you're on the bench Ferguson Sharon nice to have is nice to have you want to St Paul go ahead\nI think you can you hear me okay can hear you just fine sir rate\nWell first of all ah we're we're going to take issue as equals three of your points but\nBefore we go there I Want to see this\nGod list Donald Trump and those people who love them as our president has agreed American United States and then ... and I'm white right level seven forge less eager to know I like your show in coal into contributed pending 'cause I like what you're doing\nThat so even if we disagreed who's you know thank you for your show\nSo here's where we go we're letting everything you've said right correct they're setting this up as a political event but the truth is they're doing this because our leaders are letting them framed the narrative this is not a care of the head of illegal immigrants\nThis is an invasion of it is a new age invasion with cosponsors those cosponsors need to be painted [noise]\nThey need to be published so we can see what's happening this is the same thing as an insect world this is not complicated is not conflicts\nPeople in this United States are desperate because our country is split up because they've lost their moral foundations and their mission is a great country those people that hate Donald Trump here's what you have those people who have no place to go because you said for so long enough the public trough\nDid they know they have no place to go there now doing acts of desperation this this in the illegal invasion coming into our country is being sponsored\nI Would think that research or a reporter will be done in a heartbeat trailing all it from the ... one more thing\nWell I mean the logistics of this the logistics of this are clear I mean there there are so many people that are clearly invested in the logistics of this caravan ... they're they're willing to go two thousand miles they know they're going to be taken care of\nThere's obviously a schedule when it comes to logistics because the media is clearly sleeping somewhere every night and it's on the side of the road\nThe media is following this and all the major media groups or they're following this the entire way\nRight but but the point is you have to have accountability and you have to have rational or you have to pay the price for your actions and right now we're not to live for example or store just a minute ago the unions say damn will better be recording these phone calls these foreign countries or ... with some of our people\nTo break us as a country we all we can get to speak for three weeks the logistics of eastern person crosses the border the monetary impact our children\nHow can these people go their neighbor to say look I think you're chose not deserving but I think the one in Puerto Rico or Mexico or one of the many many central South American countries does deserve it so what's happening is the fruits of our labor of being evil and sent out to a foreign country\nSo that they can break the law to support those people here in my up in Newark traders so as long as you use terms like a Caribbean your leg them framed the narrative\nThese people think of I don't want to repeat myself but the point is do we invade Mexico\nDo we invaded so central and South America\nI don't I don't think here's what I'm saying I don't think we invade I don't think anybody has the stomach or the appetite for that I Do think if you don't need isn't the only ... I heard you out of her job problem let me finish I don't think we invade anything\nI I don't think there's a appetite to invade I don't think we should do that um I think what we should do is we should defend our border I don't think this is about the last thing I'm\nGoing after somebody I think this is about protecting your board and that's the reason why I think the president has ITS America showed a realistic response by saying\nAnd this is an important thing by saying that we would he would send the military to the border to protect\nThis country if he needs to and that is vitally important one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to let me go to Paul in California\nPaul you in California we've seen what happens round two of this uh illegal immigration I mean you have Democrats out there that are not only advocating for illegal immigrants to vote but wanting them to vote in state and local elections\nCorrect on what school cell phone with ... children that don't speak English\nAnd they're sucking up all the tax dollars and I'd like to say that the Mexican government is complicit I've travelled extensively throughout Mexico I'm aware of their passport laws and their ...\nWhy don't some hundred Americans probably marching south and see how far they get that will be put in jail by the time to get to the twenty kilometer mark\n... I wouldn't be I mean you go if you started care of and you go to Mexico and I guarantee you are going to be stopped by the Mexican government there's absolutely no way that you wouldn't be\nOn both sides once these guys get up to the border all they have to do is put one foot over the border and lay down its whole political a fire them\n... and they know that that's why they do it\nYou know some stormy there they can't read 'em up because I have to end up on the nightly news\nWell you you and I both know that this is how this works I mean everybody knows this this is this is how it works on average everybody everybody knows this is what you do this is how it works this is how you exploit the system and if you support the system this way it works out great\nGod Bless Donald Trump\nI think there's a lot of people behind them Paul God Bless you you guys could look in California because it's pretty disgusting what's happening in that state right now Scott you are actually out on Scott I hit the wrong button Jay in South Carolina you're on the bench Ferguson show Hi Jay go ahead", "show_name": "Ben Ferguson Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "22"}
