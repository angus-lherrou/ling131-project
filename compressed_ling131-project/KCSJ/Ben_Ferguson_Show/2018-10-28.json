an\nAmerican church uh and that was overshadowed because of the bombings for most of the country has a week where people are asking the question who's to blame we love to blame people for things that happen instead of blaming the individual we want to blame somebody else\nAnd I think it's unfair to just automatically assume that you can figure out why people like this do things like this when I say it's unfair it's because I don't think you can simply just say oh\nThis is that person's fault\nPeople tried to blend the bombing on Donald Trump saying well this is Donald Trump's rhetoric and it's all his faults and if he was if he wouldn't have irrational things up so much in tone things down this would have never been said this way it would have never been happier never would have been talked about this way never would have happened\nThis is his fault\nRemember Democrats ratchet up the rhetoric about Donald Trump sang impeach forty five and yelling at him and screaming at him and and their followers have become violent\nAt protests and events against conservatives you're I think that that they are to blame for the shooting of Congress men that were practicing for charity baseball game no because I don't think\nThat a person that clearly is crazy enough to do something like this is an individual is that you can hold an entire party or a president accountable for the actions of them by the way they're adults\nWe're talking about adults here older people here\n\nPeople you whether whether you were you know liking a political ... or not you know that is what you're doing is wrong\nAnd we see this happen and people say we're seeing more and more of this descending down ... synagogue mass shooting has a great example\nOf this well look at the man's online profile look what he was doing online if there's anything that inspired him it's the fact that he was able to connect\nVirtually to a community of people that believe the same things that he believes\n\nAnd they inspired one another they ... it's the same reason why we've seen so many people to be able to have been radicalized in such a short period of time\nBecause of the Internet with ISIS and al ... and Boko Haram and others I mean we see these ISIS inspired attacks where we have people that aren't that never even been to an ISIS camp or in our ... camp\nThey're trained literally over and radicalized over the Internet\n\nIs a cause and effect there's great things that come with the Internet there also the scary thing is is you\nYou can literally go out there and you can find a group of people somewhere in the world did agree ... and the things that you believe in as crazy as they are and then in doctrine eight you in them or inspire you or support you or encourage you\nWhether it is being anti Semitic whether it's being racist whether it's being a terrorist or without kind of ISIS or Boko Haram the list goes on and on\nMe you you look at Donald Trump's remarks or this weekend he condemned the the the vial hate filled anti Semitism after this shooting\nPresident Trump fiercely condemned it in response to the mass shooting\nThis was an anti Semitic at Trump's in response to the reports of eleven deaths at the tree of life sent a guy you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we never seemed to learn from the past\nThe president invited a pastor and a rabbi to offer a prayer at the beginning of his speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indiana\nHe said anti Semitism and the widespread persecution of Jews represents one of the ugliest and dark is features of human history\n\nTrump also talked about this event occurred at a baby naming ceremony at the synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath day the gum and reportedly shouted all Jews must die after being in the synagogue\n\nTrump said that anti Semitism should never be tolerated in America saying the vial hatred it filled poison of anti Semitism must be condemn it confront an everywhere and and anywhere it happen everywhere and anywhere and happens\nYou know I I I\nI'm waiting for someone to say oh this is the fault of Trump or this is the fault of so and so why can't it be the fault of the individual\nWhy is it that we are so obsessed why are they so obsessed with blaming someone\nAlways blaming someone\n\nHave to go and use it for political purposes to blame someone else\n\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two we'll get your phone calls in here the patriots without comes under oath and let me go to Ben you are on the bench for August and she'll go ahead\n[noise] [noise] ... yeah I was just thinking about it and one of the things that I was looking at well watched Trump would kind of tone it down just a little bit of when you look at somebody that's about to commit suicide or shop off a building or whatever you just don't go by there and I'm like man jumped ran jumped because\nEven though it's still that person's fault for going ahead and jumping when you go ahead and continue to push people a lot of times they go ahead and do it\nAnd just to some of his rhetoric that he's been using and saying you have a lot of wind individuals that are just like the person that thinks about jumping off a building\nAnd it's just bad if I had a job you know got got you and that's not the right thing to do and so what what I Hope he will start doing in real life and even with what's going on this week\nIt's a start telling it completely down and we all need a talented elements that are are
