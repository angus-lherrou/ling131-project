I was ... when you think about it so bad\nThis Minnesota defund hasn't been right since the NFC championship game and in many ways I think this is the one that could turn the corner for them if they can turn it around the day I think you get them back on track if they can do it which I don't think\nThey have you ever had them something like that where your ... your mind about how we got to pick a Tom Brady show the peak of view that gee daddy I don't know I think you know nobody is going back to the ball yeah\nIt but there are still gutter pretty ... Minnesota you're talking about if they get ... drip and God Bless if we get him back and get them healthy\nProbably going to be a little while we will see you without some of that [noise]\n\nThey\nThink he's the man when Mike harming what teams want now in Showalter in in ... is a is a great segue here because madness staying on and show Walter was fired\nNeither of these guys or what the next wave of managers aren't major league baseball like it or not saber metrics has a really big deal and front office\nNow they like managing the odd shot\nHim don't Fisher he actually was encouraging name yo we need you gave me doing this but grabbing your face mask that happens all the time in football\nIt used to happen all the time not any more Chris ... get to the year twenty Eighteen we're in a different world now do you remember what used to happen is not the same moral you're\nUm but I still am not a hundred percent sure like I don't think the dolphins were as good as three at all I don't think they were as bad as they were in New England last week\nA and with the license now displayed at three in one I think today will be a day that we learned some things about the dolphin\nYeah because this isn't a a turnover type defense Cincinnati I think I think that they are are going to pose a decent threat this game is in Cincinnati today\nAnd so the dolphins have a hill to climb here ten they do it I ... I I always look at the first four games of the season and we're just on the other side of that now and people have all these really\nThe rash opinions about what they've seen through the first quarter that's used and anybody who knows football knows this\nUh nobody season is won or lost in the first word games we got to get through this hump this no October and November tumble where we get to see who is perseverance we've seen it many times also you can sneak into the playoffs with a lower record and make a ton of noise in January so a lot to be learned about all these ...\nOkay James Caan or with the first score of the day is\nGoing to pop in from five yards out for the dealers what I don't know after review is whether or not it's going to stand it's going to be close as to whether or not the knee was down before you reach across on the goal line also it looked like Detroit just scored a touchdown however I think\nOf why just called it back and it was kidding golladay which means it really ticks me off because I've got Kenny or in both legs and so this just ruining my right wrist right here Kenny Golladay from fifty yards out beautiful cats in the end zone touchdown no just kidding there's a flag\nYeah may have been on hold may have been a whole thing about it but\nI'll tell ya I like this spot for the lion's today you don't like this spot for the lines today producer Lee I'm Sorry [laughter] wind up actors you know I Love me some Green Bay you know I Love me all the folks up in Wisconsin\nI just think this is a rough spot for Green Bay today there are two won and won their very banged up they're not clicking a and the lions at one in three at home or going to be a desperate football team and he might McCarthy give the ball the air and Jones those are my things I Want to say about this football game\nYeah well you know outside of Detroit's first game\nAgainst the jets where they got out early dominated on both sides of the ball a I I really do respect to a map Patricia done there because those guys didn't quit and boy oh boy well I don't feel but to retail ... game\nThat was a that was low and around and he'll took it all the way down to the thirty are lined the jags however there was a flag along the way so not in the backfield\nBut something tells me this is going to be a block in the back and this is going to do all we got a ... so this one's coming back at least part of the way and more redo first down so golladay and hill right out of the game\n[laughter] really they call the same you can look on your wide out who are willing blockers you love this stop and you really\nDo but that's gentlemen Ramsey use a physical corner and he got tied up would walk in then and on his way down there was a lot of Jersey being held so that one goes back in and they'll be first in twenty instead of a first down on the twenty\nWe did learn this though he'll does not seem bothered by the wet grass no ... that he he looks justice fat the way down yeah he uh yeah\nUh ... hill can run folks I don't know if you've noticed is a very short time and then it fell but he is extraordinary with the ball in his hand so that is good news for Kansas City but again you know the running game right there on that plane just a quick outside playing near side\nA Korean hunt tackled a with a two yard game\nI I think this is going to have to be a game where you really aim to run the ball inside the tackles because if you're going to stretch the feel left around ... should say east and west instead of going north and south you're going to have those situations where a runner is gonna have to get his feedback on during before he can actually turn up feel\nOK I Believe that touchdown indeed in Pittsburgh was overturned so ah the review shows James Connors elbow or looking at the freeze frame right now by the way he's not down at the one he's down to one inch line yeah the ... that ball shy of the goal line with the elbow down so you're starting goal from inside the one\nWho knows the ball is almost already Blake breaking the plane in fact when I played center when we had situations like this just to screw with the defense I Would put my feet right next to the bone I'd extended into the end zone\nOr you know obviously those don't count as such sounds and James Caan or what they really being run over the middle of the offensive formation healers first blood and\nThere you go yeah so and that's what this game's going to be all about if you don't score on one play it is okay you don't store on the next one and we're going to see in Pittsburgh today and now it's official the Steelers are on the board six stopping within a PHD try on the way and that is the first score of the game there are many more\nNo doubt to calm Baker may

I'm confused or that one one minute yeah he he can't hurt who was laughing next Middle Eastern ... I'm a little confused here so\nThe league is changing it's an aerial attack down field it seemed like and every single game and you got you I mean who can't get the fall down feeling [noise]\nAnd I'm not just saying that can take a shot at it [noise]\nBut it's the truth [laughter] he line Manning's longest pass completion on the season is thirty seven yards [noise] that puts him thirty six in the NFL behind every starting quarterback [noise] a couple of backup quarterback\nI I just see so many striking similarities between these two divisions I feel like the rams are about to go on a roll of dominance in that division for a long time\nYeah I mean look you look at what they're doing I think the saving grace\nIs from a financial standpoint or can the rams do this for a long period of time it it looks good but they've spent so much money guys like ... there are going to be pieces that over the next couple of years will go away or drop below in theory will be healthy I mean the story will take its turn I think about this year looks like\nAn easy here about Jared golf though his\nCareer was going one way and then all of a sudden showing McVeigh comes and revitalize is him could this be a situation where a head coach really has the you're the player to the point where buddy if if you can take less and we can get more we can keep this train a role and\nThink about Tom Brady yup it I mean he was buried on that roster he got into the injury he realized how lucky you are to get the opportunity to play for a great team and a half before to this moment to step in and an injury situation never left New England I could see this happening for the rams with golf\nIn that I could see it I just do there aren't that many times when it comes to\nCut is I don't you know there are ... ... ...\nYou know I'm All right we'll check in on sea hawks and rams with joy Taylor and just a second here on red zone radio but first we're going to check in with David Guy\nYeah buddy buddy no way am I taking a big get up and Jared guy I okay not really a pay cut he will get a raise one way or the way I watch them a raise you know that many rings ... right well if I'm not married okay fair enough but it's also by the\nWay late is single ready also mango yeah speaking of being single and Josh and the lowly Buffalo Bills that are up early\nSecond attempt bills that's fourteen no score you're\nFor\nThe Minnesota Vikings to on the bills radio network so they have the advantage early on seven to nothing riches this funny to you what\nYour laughter Josh I I just I don't know actually on the other one\nIs the weather is\nLike a news do you do it got clown shoes aren't they rent\nThe bills right out seven or nothing but the advantage rabies on top of the brown three nothing there Detroit with a seven nothing advantage over Green Bay drama Alice another ballgame law Randall cob in Kansas City\nRolling left is my home slipping ... going to\nHave\nTouchdown and Jacksonville\nFeel that it's first\nThis season in the first half and it comes on the chief's first possession\nGosh now that one is funny [laughter] you know why\nDo you do this is my ... year you know it's pouring there do you\nHear the hollow this about coal and all the all the window down here just in the rain and sideways\nAnd yet they bring in the boom my from outside of both say this the reason why giggle at play calls is because I sit next to these guys I Do the color analysis and when they really get rolling like that you realize oh yeah it's just you guys in a booth\nYeah he shouted goofy is that as you out and\nThat's part two is because the voice it sounds so big but when you meet the people in person early\nThen you're like five times like Hollywood he versus other one is for all of it yeah on a cruise a\nThree foot set up but he does his death stunts are true they can see seven nothing to do is Mississippi the Boswell miss that any way so Pittsburgh lead the Atlanta just six to nothing there Caroline I'm just going to the scoreboard so they leave New York seven to three there's no ... in Cincinnati Bengals and dolphins goose eggs guys back to you\nOkay ... thanks rely on Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would go to guy with a comical eight hundred dollars for seven all of the only hard parts\nFiguring out which way is easier reminder also for free winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com Vegas covers dot com let's go straight north of Seattle the rams will be visiting the sea hawks today so we get to visit with\nJoy sailor hey joy what don't you need to work in the morning\nOr good I'm good you know sitting in chairs that we used to sit in together venue that they don't they don't belong there you know come to that with me anymore but anyway\nUh let's check in on this game the rams embassy all this is a this is something written I I've been following very closely because uh we work during the week I'm a flash of British for San Diego state were bigger shot penny fans\nAnd this guy just cannot seem to get to the top of the depth John even though he's a first round draft pick very strange what's going on with the Seahawks running game\nOh well I was running game is a show\nToday because obviously they lost their first game trying to rely on some of it all and I felt like you\nKinda get out of pocket and then provide some world and they are they going to try and get away from that because that they won they relied on running running game it's going and that underneath that because obviously the ramp up and killing at right now\nTaking the lead by storm and he acts event is pretty much that they are they going to have had to come back there and often um college so that they're well he'll sell the whole day riots and comment so uh yeah they gave it to that\nLast weekend it you have golf thrown for sixty five five touchdowns zero interceptions on thirty three attempts with twenty six completion die\nI mean it looked near perfect it was actually a perfect pastor rating where does this off its go from here ten anybody stop the rams\nUm I I don't think so [laughter] I think it's going to have to weigh in on that you got it on the day and like I said ... coming up against Iran not what you want to be the only thing I found that having that they have but\nYou know they're very often that's operating at such a high level that ... that that that\nEven for the oc and keep them off because they got that made it like that and the confidence that GOP Nick they're playing with right now it's even that day and they they have some effect but the the I thought he playing playing in Seattle it's a different kind of had you know they haven't really seen a California yet\nAnd they all did that you know you know they haven't really seen any adversity so far so that they're treating this game that they don't want to go into it thinking that it's a giant chain guys out there right now I'm actually coming up\nLast week before man but I mean they're rolling right now so that the that's the heat them up feel joy\nTaylor with us see on the rams later today on Fox I'm Glad you met with John McVeigh and Jared golf I have a question about these two guys it almost feels like out of the game we have a little bit of a microcosm of what Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have dealt with for years where people are going is a Brady are Isabel jak Isabel check or is it Brady\nJared golf is playing really well but I don't hear a lot of people saying that it's Jerry golf a lot of people give credit to Sean McVeigh what did you\nWhat did you gather from talking to these two guys\nIt's funny that you say that again after they left the room talking about how uh\nHow they ... on on point the two of them are and you can tell that they're all under the age is as he got a lot of things terminology and uh just ... when they are answering questions summer\nAnd I I that's the guy that was like no it's not very valid check yet what does happen um except for you know a little more uh you know highly than a dollar jackets by yeah you definitely have a point there um\nThey give each other credit though um\nWe're we're we're all we're all kind of trying to get to the bottom of like how to turn around its team from having the opposite end of the year later having it back up and then now gossiping about what would have been a thought you really I mean between him and I'm the only discussion for NBC this year\nThe remarkable and they won't give us a hidden camera but basically what they say they both say is that there's a lot of chance ... Haitian within ... and they often worked really hard and I mean we all like to think that if we hardly have jak often you know starting quarterback for the LA rant but\nUh you know like they had some kind of the formula that maybe one day we'll get the thirty or thirty or something but\nTo me the metric I got from it that they're they're all really on the same page they all just go to work everyday and really focused and\nYou know we talked to you know he kind of had the same same launch it though I I guess the answer but I'm sure there is a much more technical a think tank opted to turn that around\nStaying on the rams are really talks about up and so I think the defense has not done enough press their top ten they're yielding less than twenty points to game yeah wait fill up to now the Denver Broncos miss him there middling defense with one of the world's best pass Russia's von Miller\nWhat has weighed done with this organization that so special on that side of the ball\nYeah yeah well ... and that's becoming more of a thing don't get me wrong he'll get his but they have options offensively and so I don't think number eleven is the first thought or top of mind is play schemes words you used to be a Julio Jones is deficient when you're throwing the ball I think he is better\nOr as the two honestly because as a one over the past season or so it hasn't been great sharing the spotlight with some of these running backs out of the backfield with a with Calvin Ridley now I think it takes some of the pressure off I think he actually shines more when he has help\nOffend well yeah I don't know whether it's easy to one or whatever I can just say spreading the the the wealth around a little bit is probably a healthy thing for Julio it's probably a healthy thing for ah for the entire\nAh Atlanta Falcons off it so keep an eye on that one looks like a fun one today Thirteen to seven Steelers one that already is threatening to get out of hand\nIs Detroit already leading Green Bay fourteen to nothing erasures just fumbled the ball Detroit picked it up\nAnd so they've got really good feel position Detroit how's the ball already knocking on the door of the red zone again a leading fourteen to nothing and just everything about this game has been a total disaster from the Packers standpoint early going they got one drive into going physician based in Crosby missed a field goal\nRemember weren't a weather controlled environment it was not that long ago you'll go just pulled it left a and now they've turned the ball over have not been able to sustain anything they've got all of the injuries as far as the receiving corps is concerned about the ... doesn't doesn't even have a ... yet uh this is just been\n... yeah and the lines again I think better than than they showed out early in the season on prime time football so everybody has this thought process about Detroit going into the season and it's ill conceived because map Patricia has proven\nTo be a more greedy and determine coach in a I'm a a better team than I I think anybody expected to see the season they have a lot of weapons offensive well you mentioned golladay earlier golden ... obviously ... staffers who everybody\nLoves to pile on with this this theory that he's padding stats at the end of a lot of losing efforts but I'll tell you this right now I don't care if it's at the end the games I don't care if it's at the beginning of the game I don't care if it's when you're you're going down in the fourth quarter to win the whole potato\n... if you are putting up the sort of statistics that match Stafford is put up over his career that's a good quarterback in this defense is playing inspired right now after having a really tough start against the jets they've built themselves back up to a what looks like a contender I don't know if that when this division but they'll give a lot of people problems\nAll right we uh we are trying to gather information on what just happened to Carolina Panthers just took a fourteen three lead they already had a cab Newton to Kurdish Daniel touchdown play earlier in the game\nBut they've just scored again let me read the game cast report for you that just came down in front of us here it is um the Panthers pond\nDown to the giants too old outback must the cat's tested the giants to recovered by the giants Norris Jenkins at the New York giants five Jenkins to the New York giants three for two yards from balls recovered by Carolina at the New York giants zero\nTouchdown Graham good no extra points because what we have is above\nFollowed by a recovery followed by another fumble followed by a recovery and the Panthers are in the ads out\nBy the way if you're following this Jacksonville game that's in Kansas City right now to Kansas City looking great offensively Jacksonville\nMonday or go Caesar yelled at and the Kansas City territory that and\nThat is going to be something you're going to hear I say a lot during the game because they are out of back so Leonard for net out and court grant just left the field or on a cart because he has a lower leg injury that occurred in their last series or before the break here and so TJ yelled and going to get a lot of run out of the backfield for Jacksonville\nAlright yelled and already on the day\nYeah looking yeah outlets that he has only had one target did not make the cat so seven carries thirty nine yards grand I'd want to carry got hurt on that they don't have any other they gotta have some other back on the roster I go into the game but you\nKnow my my yeah my guess is they have a now they're back to active I have no idea who it is because I went to the fish will a page for the Jacksonville Jaguars checked out there that shark Corey Grant is the last on the list Leonard we're not and yelled in ahead of him so I don't know who they put into jail yelled and\nI'm seeing a guy on the roster named Brandon Wilds out of ... to ...\nYou just grab the you just grab the run up came off your status is active or not a parachute years so this is what happens he may be especially the ... been a scout\nGuy got activated for game we I don't know but they're in trouble in the backfield in Jacksonville they don't have a lot of their horses walk\nAll right and tend to nothing is the score for the chiefs already in that game and actually

I mean it might be strange at first but eventually it's a lifestyle the games except it yeah and and I know many people are down on vote pending and why are you having bullpen pitchers come in and it's the first couple of these well not every team has two or three really good start\nSponsored by Colorado a one one of the Colorado broadcasters association and this station\n\nMike rice Corey Lopez Rockies react after this season ending six nothing lost to the birds in game three of the LDS at Coors Field we are full lines we appreciate that will be getting to as many calls as we can but quickly Greg throughout a couple of names let's just take one ... what do you think happens there with no and what do you want to see him do Goree\nWell it's interesting I saw that a a Patrick Saunders actually kinda tweeted this out and having that chance you know the media hordes get down there and had a chance to talk to them no one says the ... expects\nTo be in spring training with the Rockies and at the same time he doesn't want to talk about it right now because the nervous a little raw after the loss in the end of the season um you and I have talked about this on Rocky's react a little bit about no and I think the conversation has to be had with Nolan about what does he\nExpect from the Rockies what kind of contract are you looking at and if it's too much for the Rockies then there's moves that have to be made and it also means\nThat you can make some other moves with guys who's contracts are coming up this year and the guy that comes to mind Mike to me is DJ LeMahieu and I think no one's decision and how much money is available may directly affect\nOr indirectly affect a DJ it'll make you coming back next year\nWe'll see how all of that works out but I Would agree I think that decision with Nolan if you know for sure if the Iraqis know for sure and I think they have to get a real good idea\nIf they're going to be able to sign him long term because if not and then you have a budget amounts set for Nolan then that affects everything else you do I'm not saying that they would automatically keep DJ\nBut I think there's a better chance because I don't know Brendan Rogers is going to be major league ready coming out of spring training that's a tall order even for someone his talented as him and I think if you have long term plans for Rogers at second I think the guy who gets you there in the short term\nIs if it's not DJ is Garrett Hampton but I don't I think camps in would probably probably be better suited for that super utility role kind of like we've seen ... more last year than this year have\nFor the Rockies and I think I think Hampton is a is a more skilled and in more talented player\nThan pat let's get to a couple more phone calls Dennis is in Littleton joining us on Rocky's react guy Dennis\nI I'm Wondering if I put the D. J. thing and then some other stuff but you know I think one of the worst things that happened to him story the story of three home runs and then when DJ at that walk off against Arizona\nI didn't see him do is classic inside out swinging or he was rolling over on every ... even today's game it was that the double the ... you wrote over shortstop ... you know it worked for for ...\nJeter fame and work for a DJ when he was a winning ... titles and starting to think I think the biggest one of the big things about going to court field\nIs that it makes you feel is that you know everybody Babe Ruth but you've got a small ball in the in the playoffs because the pitch and great and of all people Alex Rodriguez was saying that tore sold them all the time I\nDon't know ... on single single single the good things will happen I think we fall into that trap that wants to comment on that at least that's kind of it you know who cares at this point but still\nYeah oh yeah I'll take the D. J. thing I might buy might have some thoughts on this as well I think DJ tried to expand his horizons a little bit and become a more complete hitter I appreciate what you had to say and uh and what DJ was really good at\nAnd that is going the other way and that inside out swaying but\nPeople started to shift on him that became the book on D jays will make you that he was normally going to go the other way and he wasn't going to pull the ball so he tried to do that now granted his batting average dropped to about two Seventy six for the season here\nThis year but I think tried to use all fields as opposed to always being inside out I think trying to expand the horizons and Mike I mean whether it was a failed experiment or not it certainly\nUm what's different to see DJ doing that I don't think he got greedy and and I don't think he thinks he's going to be a home run hitter but I think he tries to do more things when he's up there so they can't shipped into that are inside out swaying\nYeah I mean I I'm always reluctant to say this is what he was trying to do just because it happened that way I don't know that he wanted to roll everything over or if he was making a conscious effort to swing for the fences\nI think the Rockies and know that if they can players talk about this all the time if they keep their approach the same if they look to drive the ball the home runs will come Charlie Black when it's told me that no one has said that ... story has talked about it\nThe reason why Rockies hitters get them the reputation of\nTrying to hit home runs is because of the ballpark it's sort of lends itself to that and I I think at some level it's unfair so Dennis I'm not trying to cop out on your question because clearly the batting average number was down for DJ the power number he had a career Hi what Fifteen Seventeen home runs whatever it was yeah yeah\nSo I ... I Would really have to talk to a DJ to say where are you making a conscious effort to hit more homeruns my guess is he would say no could have just been a year where\nMore flare hits didn't fall maybe he got away at times from going or trying to go middle right in in in his approach I don't know so I'm not trying to cop out I just don't want to speak for him\nIn a way that that because I just don't know I Will say this the average is down across the board average is not the only measure of successful hitting these days it can be a good measure of success will hitting\nFact of the matter is a\nDJ LeMahieu if the if the Rockies can keep him I'd want him to keep him his ... is off the charts and that's a big of a reason as any for me\nSo I'm Sorry Mike I keep jumping in and right and it just to add one more thing it is interesting eleven or those Fifteen home runs came on the road [laughter]\nYou ask him to be a monster on the road but and also this to you as well that you know the best person to answer this would be obviously DJ um\nI talked about him maybe trying to become a more complete hitter and Mike you know this in baseball there's a lot of factors they may have been pitching him a little differently this year after being the NFL batting champion that he had been seeing different pitches as well yep\nThree three seven one three eighty five eighty five on Rocky's react
