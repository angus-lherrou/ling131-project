about a six to ... you know\nDan Patrick [noise] we have not am eastern six specific on Fox Sports radio now is John John leaves you when\nYou think the media is anti Cam Newton the media voted him MBP the media those union the Heisman Trophy winner there is no more multiple narrative because the media voted him for the two most prestigious awards in college in one in the NFL the you're going to

this I've been in plenty to nothing last week\nCalled the scene top in the early ... some people would take another decided not to start by calling you talked about earlier though you know you had the difference is is this relationship on the what\nWell I'd say it's really rocky you don't talk about your coach public building unless there's some problem I was\nCut you know I Do not believe the prey to Mike mccarthy I Do think he's possibly jealous of all the quarterback send this week [noise] mainly if you look at breeze and you look at my home\nDrama in Packer land we talked earlier this show as well about drama with a giant today they're facing the Panthers in Carolina although back in the junior reportedly not happy with the big blues thinking dumped that does that\nDo Jimmy his new wife or the giants to consider\nThat often when he came to date you know if he doesn't think\nIs good but just on former both safety Eric Green and he's actually starting today Michael forget the anthem issue is losing filing against a week from a purely football standpoint\nI don't think the guy wasn't on a team because then when the football skilled in the form of pro ball there he is an absolute leader I think Caroline and got better no secondary by by the\nCurrent [noise] All right well Caroline is trying to keep pace in the in the south about things and one is we're just looking to stay alive as they head to Pittsburgh satin material is tied for second most is\nHe's one of the few survivors in Atlanta things are\nGoing to solve this problem is simply the\nThey couldn't use read I I mean the man up is the right thing to say it but in reality to soften test carry this group so hopefully they get beyond Jones in San Antonio\nBy [noise] All right but ... says he respects bin Laden was burger but he wasn't afraid to move back to sleep in\nBed hadn't seen me yet and all of us are about that you use the hall of famer Phil fan because a lot of Britain Myers landed a one on one interview process burger you might be facing his toughest task of the Fifteen Years he's playing the NFL he's trying the same ... hello Britain\n[noise] hey Kurt good to talk of lovable even my family does would use that term were with me but I can tell you that that that is not in love with his team's record after a month into the season he did say that he has more control of this deal are all bets on the way that he's ever had\nOver the decade the happier in Pittsburgh attacked as recently as friday he put in a new player new formation of a different personnel hoarding series of new place he hopes will help today no way beyond bell slight disconnect with Antonio Brown would have been worried about this team he's not showing [noise]\nAnybody right now\nWe describe the Steelers are desperate team ready no no no no for games in early in the season we need to have a sense of urgency but not desperate and after the most recently lost with Baltimore the quote you said I'm not playing well it has put a lot of blame on again when you're not with a ball game doesn't matter I think\nThe question is our ab and I know what's going on where's the connection\nDes Moines is I just haven't played well\nAs far as the double still every single plane if I can get him off\nTo a ball where he can catch a run the Margaret\nBe on bill from the outside we watch the the impact does represent what it's been like not having them early on it was definitely there are a lot of questions not know what's going on but once we mostly wasn't here we just had to move on if Belgium and the reports to the team do you accept it with open arms\nYeah we just don't know what it's going to be you know there's been a lot of reports of rumors can this team go to the playoffs without\nYeah absolutely you know they weren't very good football team I think he helped our chances\nLater mama we saw Gerald but going on how much I guess he tackled you\nAbout the run through the past year your bingo you're a tough guy you make plays and\nUh do you get the same benefit as ... as the smaller lighter not use this year actually it was the first dog gotten any calls that still banned so much a part of of your game right is hanging in there until the very last moment using your size and then leaning on your arms that kind of the bottom line we walk up\nOr not want interrupt the blow dead because nobody big plays of happen kind of in that last minute mode\nOver the years the great defense or the Steelers that was that was kind of a ... a lynchpin for this franchise really the last decade or so it's been more about on the office are you comfortable\nI don't know that all the fans are ... you know they still they still believe that defense but you know the the league is kind of change right Peter putting up thirty forty points almost regularly now so you have to\nWith the Joneses and they're trying to score\nThe porches you can I Know it's hard to say now what would have to happen for this Steeler seemed to contempt for the super bowl this year when just when when one game we started the the bad\nThe way you want to start a but but really just take one give us on not look ahead we can't look to the playoffs we can't we can't answer that question how do you get to the playoffs it how do we wouldn't want\nSay to turn it around you can lean on the great history of the Steelers but you can't rely on it as far as getting the ball the brown Antonio put it best when he phrased it as like live five you know sometimes the connection is more sometimes the connection is great but you always connected to expect to have a big game today\nAgainst the beat up thousands detest so as we throw it back we go from lifeline to a guy he was still listen to music at high fine Terry Bradshaw I take it away\nThat wasn't a shot I didn't take it as a shot at all I\nOut that I I Can't talk to talk about this football game it reminds me how he like an MBA all star game yeah everybody shows up and they say look forget the deep I Know deep in the day everybody would score are going to be fifty points bites\nSo no defense today and I guess whoever does have some defense late in the in the fourth quarter probably win the football game\nSurprised of all the teams\nThe history of the Steelers has always been what\nThe the better ever since Nineteen Seventy\nNow it's so hard for me to adjust to op ed fun\nYou get you get a what that kid tightened McDonald's tied in love this kid big powerful guy got to be a lot of fun watching this football game but I think of it as kind of like an MBA all star\nGame yeah is gonna be a lot of fun but you know both teams are desperate then they've got one when as you ought to be even more desperation after today for somebody you know and you talk about the things that you're giving up twenty nine points you came here you can't\nYou can't go that way you can't win a championship that way well they'd let us not any better you know they're just as bad on defense I think they put a little bit of a band aid on his day out\nOn the positive side he's putting up numbers that are comparable to his MVP season two years ago I think he liked it up\nToday in Atlanta missing beyond ... out of Neal ethic that I've heard them be spent the off miserably they get democracy Freeman\nBack which is going to be a big thing for them to go to not only in the running game but also in ... catching the ball\nOut of the ... he created metro problem but it is still a shame that they only have one way with all this talent\nOn often do you have Jones is a new one now really come in with sticks are found that ... I mean really may have all that counted but on the other side of the ball and Pittsburgh in your band and you're going into new round was already talking about I'm not catching a ball enough if Matt Ryan is making great connection with his receivers\nTony ... brown will be looking at been like um it's competitive here I Need to do what they're doing told me the ball\nTo how it before I went to go to the beginning of the AFC you've got Jacksonville the number one defense against Kansas City has got the number one scoring often slip by Patrick well today\nThis officers dynamic with by Patrick homes or the defense athleticism speed talent at every level this is by far I think his greatest challenge today holds\nAn interesting guy in his early in the second year he's not a gimmick is not a a guy that defense you're going to be able to figure out he's there for the long haul or he's the real deal I think he's the combination of for Rogers and you see some Russell Wilson\nYeah in fact yeah there you don't want me out there in a while but yeah yeah yeah I think he had written a why he's great he's going to be great for a long time [laughter]\nYou look like you're waiting to say something\nOr was it it passed a home related to Patrick my home small them\nOkay it's my own poll where we find these guys are going to cost you have to deal with one another early but also wrong players who got four game suspension stuff that seems to be back on the field so Jake laser Jay\nTerry I'll just get along I was real drastic hey Jay\nWere first talked about this what our premiums on
