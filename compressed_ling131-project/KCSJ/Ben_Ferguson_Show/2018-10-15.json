know what food stamps through your whole life is not living a good life\nGovernment aid your whole life is not living a good life\n\nThat's what I think about this\nAnd people said that county west sounded insane I heard that over and over and over again they Kanye West sounded crazy and that's what one of the callers earlier I I Want to go back to a chance on this one chance and I asked her I said what Kanye say at the White House ... that was crazy crazy talk\nWell the first thing he said was about to start with the man it was like oh you are you serious did you really just say that you know that the thirteenth man\nYou're what you're saying that him talking about amendments is insane\nThat's not what I said you know what the thirteenth eliminated you know what that was the beginning of\nThe constitution United States of America neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party's show have been Julie convicted shall exist within the United states or any place subject to their jurisdiction that ... that was\nThe beginning you're still not getting their you're still not\nThat I I just I ... yeah clearly I Know what it was about what is your point\nThere now but no you really don't know what is\nThat the thirteenth man that was it was to abolish slavery and involuntary servitude ... as as punishment for a crime either\nListen if they're going to say I don't know when I just quoted to you I'm going to answer your darn question the Thirteen them at the United States Constitution abolish slavery first off second of all it also abolish involuntary servitude which is what many slave overs we're saying whether or not my slaves\nTheir their their servants and that's different and so they made sure that involuntary servants who was there and then they said some of them said well they're actually just criminals and they are paying off their debts for crimes\nSo they even had an except as punishment for a crime\nThis happened and I think it was ... Eighteen fifty four sixty four or five remember from history and I apologize I don't have the exact year it was it was in that either the Eighteen fifty four sixty four that own it is I Know exactly what you're talking about\nThat will be able to rescue eight years old and put in jail for three years or spending on the street\nThat I ... I usually just explain that to you what is your point\nYou haven't explained it to me I'm trying to tell you you're just not ...\nOkay I Want to paint ... chance that ... you just brought up something I just explained it to the listeners they knew we were talking about you're announcing I didn't explain it\nI just explained it to so let's let's move back to the actual conversation about Kanye West and not a conversation of you know can you quote the constitution stay the constitution\nAn awful lot when I was younger I Know a lot about the constitution\nThe show is not about the constitution I it's about\nPeople like you who are acting like because Kanye West is now all of a sudden they conservative believing in conservative values that you guys are now trying to turn him into some sort of crazy bipolar sleep deprived\nA insane individual instead of respecting his opinion and saying he's an Uncle Tom because he's not being a quote real black man the\nThing is what you're not listen and you just said something earlier that when you said living on food stamps is not a lifestyle living outside the gate the majority of black people have to think you still have that sort of the United states population the Muslim people don't live like that you may need so much from those inner cities and things like they can attribute that to everybody black because\nThat I didn't I didn't the number one recipient of welfare in this country single white females that's right okay I Know it's ... ... chance don't don't act like when I when when I give us that you go that's right like you're teaching me something I'm the one that just quoted you\nThat information I Know who the number one recipient is the food stamps I never implied what you just implied I Want to make that very clear\nBut what I'm telling you is that the head up the it's not a battery represent them black public ... that that's no big deal but\nThere are very few black Republican in their\nHair out on oil or chance there are very few black Republicans that's just a fact statistically African Americans as\nA race okay African Americans as they race overwhelmingly vote democratic\n\nThen it's Hispanics but the number one by race that ... is African Americans are Democrats\nIt has no I'm a Democrat the Republican like that have nothing to do with it but it\nSure does it has everything to do with when a Republican what look at what Democrats say the Clarence Thomas a black man when he was going to be on the Supreme Court think about that\nThinking about that\nThat the only way to accomplish that\nThey try to destroy his life\n\nThat doesn't mean that was something that has nothing to do anything but I'm like\nOkay All right I'm going to move on I've had enough of this conversation one

U.S in Saudi Arabia over the fate of a missing journalist\nBecause Kanye West is an authentic black man\nKanye West is a real African American man that lives in an African American world that is a part of African American culture\nClarence Thomas was never a real threat to the hard core Democratic Party that's black because they already turned him into a white guy who married by the way a white woman they slandered him that way\nYou didn't have to worry about Ben Carson being a real black man for example because Ben Carson was too smart that's what I was told by a blackout a Democrat\nWho said well he's not a real black man said why it's like he's he he he literally act like it was a kind of thing that he's ... he's a neurosurgeon he's on he's not a real black man\n\nIt's not a real black man so if you're successful and as a doctor you're no longer a black man well he never grew up in the neighborhood that I grew up in okay Kanye West it by the way\nTony west of the guy that also has said things that were cheered by the left and the Democratic party when he came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people at that fundraiser after Hurricane Katrina hit and nobody\nSaid the Kanye West was an Uncle Tom that no one said he wasn't black then no one said he was crazy that no one said he was bipolar that\nWas the Democratic party has done this week they've done two things that kind of a west all because he wears a make America great again hats\nWell challenging the president issues like stop and frisk which a lot of African Americans I think would agree with me is a policy that they feel like is an inappropriate policy based on race\nThat it allows police officers to target minorities disproportionately stop and frisk that's the reason why judges said it was unconstitutional it's the reason why will not be done in any city in this country because it will be immediately shut down\nBut what Kanye West's they've done two things that kind of this week one they have taken away any of his accomplishments by saying that he has an ignorant dumb man\nHe isn't ignorant and dumb man in fact democratic leaders came out and they said they said this about ... they said that ... and I'm going to play this for you because I Want you to hear it they said this about Kanye West\nWas rapidly negroes don't read ah\nKanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nTell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nKanye West is what happens when he grows don't read\nOne more time to tell you is what happens when they grow don't read\nNow\nDid anybody say that about Kanye West when he came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people know because he was a hero then of the left but what Kanye West is doing now is Kanye West is a guy who was\nHas a lot of influence in the African American community and they know it and they're terrified so they've got to turn them into a crazy man this week I heard people say that the president was taking advantage of a mentally unstable man that clearly needs to be in a hospital\nAll because he supports the president the United states America now now what did he say that was so crazy and again I said there's certainly if you're watching us on Facebook Live a please share this video\nSo that hopefully other African Americans are thinking about maybe not voting party lines in the midterms who might be thinking about voting for some Republicans who actually see this I Hope that this goes viral hope a million two million people\nHere this because I'm trying to lay out the incredible amount of racism is coming from the Democratic party towards African Americans African Americans the Democratic party they don't they don't respect your intelligence\nIn fact they don't want you to become an independent thinker because it's a threat to their party they don't want you to have\nGood paying jobs because then you don't need the Democratic party more for government aid and welfare they don't want you to be unsuccessful schools that's the reason why they keep you and your kids in failing schools and failing community so that you'll be desperate for their government aid when they fail you when it comes to your education\nThey don't want you to do\nAmazing things in your life because if you do you have less need for the government which means you have less need for the Democratic party\n\nI I mean this is that this is nothing but flat out racism\nWhen when when when you are a Democrat and you come out against ... and I said this earlier can you imagine if a white guy can you imagine if a black Republican would have said this about colon cap for Nick when he started kneeling can you imagine what would have happened to the magic of a black\nRepublican would have said about colon cancer and at the same thing with a black Democrats said about Kanye West\nWas rapidly negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and promoted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with mentally fix or some\nToken Democrats staying with them and take pictures can you imagine if a black Republican would have said that about ... this is what happens when ... when a negro doesn't read\nIf you think the Democratic party cares about you as an African American\nI Would say look at the last week if you think the Democratic party respects you as an African American I Would say look at the Democratic party\n\nDo yourself a favor just just go tell a democratic elected official you're thinking about voting for Republican just thinking about it posted up on social media posts on your timeline hey I'm an African American man or woman but I'm thinking about voting for Republicans the midterms and watch how fast\nYou're democratic friends will turn on you\nWatch how fast they will come after you watch how fast they will call you an Uncle Tom\nThey won't encourage a ... some sort of debate\nThey won't
