the same kind of bitter aftermath Jerry how do you see it\nWell I think we're going to end up with divisions again you know because the way to mid term is shaping up and and by the way you know they're still three weeks ago and that's an eternity in American politics today so [laughter]\nPredictions are very dangerous spot if you were to take a snapshot today you say it looks as if the picture's improving somewhat for Republicans\nBut Democrats probably still have the or in a good position to take back control of the house because a lot of those house races are playing out the swing races are playing out in suburban\nDistricts where they're Democrats are stronger and where's the college educated suburban women I become a very strong democratic constituency so they seem to be a good position to take back control of the house but at the same time\nRepublicans look as if they're in better shape to keep control the Senate\nOr in some measure because the Republican base was very unhappy with the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated as a Supreme Court nominee and that has kind of energized the Republican base and reminded them that they like having Republicans pick and confirmed judges and so\nAh the balance in the Senate will be determined in a bunch of red states where there's a lot of pro Trump support and so\nYou're going to have it you could very well end up with a picture of a divided Congress and Democrats thinking that they uh have won a a a national\nVote in an ass it's the same way they did when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote twenty sixteen but don't have a very big hold on political power if they simply have one half of Congress and so\nThat's a that's a recipe that is probably going to produce um obviously divided government has a hard time getting things done and it's a continuing democratic anger at their opposition within the political system\nStarts so there's no ... for example uh [noise] I'm no lessening of the divide because the Democrats let's say when the house and Republicans maintain control the Senate because there's more balance I mean\nWell ... you know that's possible and in order a couple of issues interestingly trade maybe one they're actually may be some common ground you know there are a lot of Democrats who are\nCloser to President Trump on trade and his use of tariffs and um basically challenging allies on trade issues there are some Republicans are Republicans have tended to be more free traders [laughter] so you may actually have a slightly bigger\nBalance of support for the president I'll trade in a divided Congress but on most issues and particularly on health care it's going to be very hard to get something done 'em and I think you're going to have\nA and if he if Democrats do in fact take back control of the house there's going to be inevitably pressure from the Democratic base to begin investigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially\nA reef revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some financial dealings with the president and the aftermath of a mall or in investigation and so you definitely going to have a more confrontational atmosphere in Congress or if there is democratic control of one house\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ...\nHe's written a piece about how the election is unlikely to end the political divide that we're seeing you're up to that a\n... and I want to ask the forty incumbent House Republicans who are vacating their seats with this feeling about a democratic wave be different if the ... the majority of those forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of it it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know some some of those are the Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can answer that opens the door all the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there's an open seat or Republican U.S left", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city":
