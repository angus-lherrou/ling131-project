veterans running on the on the Democratic side\nOr the vets a seemingly willing to do this\nSo this has been a who's been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party of said that veterans have been a habit of coaching at parties say where we're interested in running a and the same time the Democratic party has a has a number of different things that it's putting into place\nTo to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat in the house of representatives to put together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role
