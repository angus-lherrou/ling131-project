several major a major markets have noticed a flurry of reasons steps\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan booming who's been researching this make them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible to everybody that this is a climate is\nExisted for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of their hunt as as well are being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle they they basically ... out of the steering wheel and then they sell it on the black market\nAnd in ... with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the airbag or is this tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens is that when you need the gear bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop get replaced their\nUm some people ever going to get\nA day on the side they're going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable\nType of repair shop and that's where a lot of these types airbags ended up being sold if you actually go on E. bay for example in the search for this you will see their airbags means hold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships something you're not going to end up accidently buying a\nUser airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happened to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's of long way targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular but we don't make much sense to me is why only because in talking to the police and various markets um\nYou know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this so what do you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific Arabic conductors or something and exactly what it is\nProbably the thief themselves are the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nSo it is these are what uses a nice ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nThey somehow gain access to the vehicle and then they basically a use a knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes I to some incidents where\nYou know they hit a dozen vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night show you know it's it's definitely um\nThere's not a difficult thing to think about it this is like you know as a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars [laughter] that's about how much this\nIs worth so there's a big incentive for the season you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the Dakota one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so\nBut there's also no well we're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in to the police the flurry of Honda airbags deaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\nA few different to you you probably consider here number one is we see in a vehicle near St late or near a parking lot late that can help because these aren't going to choose a vehicle that's way under the late that could make them easy to spot\nSecondly I hadn't thought of this you can try not to park near a big vehicles that are maybe a structure\nOf the the view so when the the kind of hide behind the big SUV or big truck that's one thing to consider it unless they in some kind of old fashioned but you can always join the club if you think you know in a market where you are really susceptible to this\nIs Nathan Nathan booming USA Today business reporter is Twenty one
