giant floating trash collected to try to scoop it up it's a daunting task the patch includes about one point eight ... really in pieces of trash\nAnd ways to eighty eight thousand tons the equivalent of five hundred jumbo jets and while many scientists say it's great that people are trying to clean up the patch others say most of our efforts should instead go towards stopping the out of control flow of plastic garbage into the ocean\nIt's a story by Joya writes science writer at USA Today joy will tell us about the patch\nAbout like the solid mass it's about like eh it's not like a thing you can necessarily\nYou see from an airplane or from space\nBecause a lot of it is just under the surface and it's also a lot of little a lot of it it's broken down at a rather small pieces so\nWhen you think of it it's not like you can't walk on edge and you can't like a you know it's about this blob of something that's like a solid by any stretch it kind of spread out over an area about twice the size of Texas\nGoodness gracious to do um currents play a role in sort of keeping it all together is in weather patterns things like that\nIt's mainly ocean currents that's the main thing that keeps the thing's going or a ... they're called jai ours is just the scientific term and that's just a kind of a circular pattern swirling around the ocean and it it eventually it's kinda like in the bath tub it circles around and around there all the stuff kind of collects in one area\nAnd that's what's happened here that that it's a a ... that's kind of goes around much of that part of the Pacific\nJust ends up circling together to this one mass and as I said there's other jai hours in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic ocean and ah so this is this is one of several around the world well\nWho's responsible for ... for all this mess\nAnd yeah it's all humans it's a you know there was obviously no plastic before the fifties or Nineteen fifties and so basically it's just a uh it's just all of us around the world and dumping plastic not disposing of properly\nIt to just flow out into the ocean I'm this particular patch or it's probably mainly uh from Asia or they they they they seem to think that most of the ocean trashes from China\nIndonesia the Philippines and that's that's kind of been the source for a lot of it the U.S is is somewhat of a contributor it's not we're not completely blameless but we are over all doing a better job than some of the some of the developing countries around the world so\nThat that is that wind up in there if if ... if let's say that China is to blame for a good chunk of this are they actually dumping it in the ocean or they can't process what they have were being sense\nWell yea for quite a while they were happily accepting garbage a plastic garbage from around the world you know 'cause ... other countries didn't know what to do with it and so we are other countries which ship it to China and that that was something that was well no we would ship them our garbage and our plastic\nAnd for whatever reason we didn't no one really seemed to you know see no evil well you know it's we've shifted there we didn't really know what they did with it well you know could very well be they were just don't make it into the ocean\nAh we we don't know because we don't really ... track that but they have actually China has stopped accepting trash from other parts of the world that was the last couple of years so that that will no longer be a a dumping ground for this plastic\nUh so where where other countries are going to have to figure out what to do with it a rather than just dumping China\nWe're speaking with soil rice science reporter at USA Today has ... where did the trash in the great Pacific garbage patch come from and how do we stop it you quoted somebody in the stories that\nAre ... there were these wonderful cleanup efforts going on but that's a waste of time largely we need to spend more time figuring out how to keep this up out of the ocean\nWas just mentioning that this is a pig to the\nTo the ocean cleanup project which is a very noble and nobody nobody saying you know necessarily that it's not a good thing but uh that uh it's this project developed by a Netherlands company a very young guy started about a few years ago he was Eighteen at the time\nAnd it's the ocean cleanup project and he's invented this kind of this large scooping mechanism that he and some of his colleagues there believe will uh\nWill actually be able to soak up for school up a lot of this trash and the ocean if it's successful we'll go out and uh you know tackle the actual patch later this year at ... years to come or having said that to some experts are saying that really Ninety five percent of our focus should be on",
