this morning with all the [noise] the extra spending\nTime with is the country's largest retailer at one point Sears has filed for bankruptcy around\nSince Eighteen eighty six it's been around right don't end by the great recession and more recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now watch here's Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead\nWell it's going to be a big downer for the holiday season or they're going to be liquidating lots of stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores and then all the merchandise is going to be kind of dumped on the market right in the middle of the holiday season\nThey have about Seventy thousand workers good number of those will be laid off just kind of what happened earlier this year with toys R. us and it just kind of the ... the whole retail market\nSo which ... the lessons here or what they missed out going on line with\nTheir way through high there they took on a huge amount of that they have five point six billion dollars in debt on Monday they have a hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment they couldn't make which is what kind of ...\nUh the chapter eleven filing um they had too many assets as far as all the stories that were not kept up well\nPeople just didn't go to theaters anymore and they they lost Amazon but they lost of other places as well the Home Depot\nAnd various other people that took their their market share it's been around for a hundred and twenty five years I mean they had a real run at its peak the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share and two thousand seven down to panic though yeah so it it was one of the great American companies that just to keep up with the times\nWhat a what could have saved them stay say I don't know what's starting in the eighties maybe they were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively a kick out the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions are competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores [noise] uh but it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of\nEmployees of the high cost base it would have been hard for them to survive this very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what are the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now that they sort of live in fear\nI think so um and the stories of not popular anyway so they don't ask her but at the current issue\nThose places will be we developed\nA maybe from the store maybe for other purposes I mean those gems in restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise] um so ... even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be the space will be repurposed but it's got to be a big drag them a lot of them they currently have\nA total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to the holidays is probably liquidate them off that's eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's money he answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well uh they're doing a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk up I Know exactly what it says no cashiers whatsoever so\nAnd they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it is an irony but they're doing a much more strategic way a much more limited inventory in select locations fears just got too big and had too much of a jury and too many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\n[noise] yeah I mean the products are good and and yes I think you're going to fail incredible prices for\nAppliances electronics clothes and all of his fears office yes I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is a tech sales away from other traditional retailers will probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from all the stores\nWill we still know the Sears brand than a year five years from now\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example ... fears about that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some brands but most of the brands have been sold out so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear over to our\nNext Jordan Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man\nIs more of a program\nIs brought to you by light stream if you have a balance on

extraordinary storm and uh it's very difficult on the ground\nI'm home served on schools here on business there on a power is still coming back a bet a lot of people are without\nUm communication towers came down there is still the bread and some of the road so it's\nA challenging environment and we're doing what ever we possibly can\nTo help people out um we have about Thirteen hundred volunteers in the affected area and they're twenty three shelters that are open about Fifteen hundred people living in them and there were ten thousand people AT T coil but we also have um\nAt Seventy five emergency response vehicles in their ... around the affected area and giving people hot meal and um water and lots of hug and so far we've already served about\nHundred twenty five thousand meals snack so it's a big operation um are volunteers here amazing I never\nUh never get used to have generous they are I just and he can make me\nAny feel for how long they'll be there at this point\nWell we cannot leave until the last person in a shelter it plays poker and of course we had um a number of people that are employees and volunteers that live in the impacted area because\nWe're in about three thousand counties across the country\nSo um they never leave they they don't pack up and go home because they are um and um yeah we\nWe just stay until people find a place you go to that point you people in shelters in the Carolinas from Hurricane Florence ... is that right yeah yeah\nAnd so you know this is a difficult period I I think generally speaking like stories now start not to get told right the media begins to pull away from affected areas as they start to focus on other breaking news uh does this become more difficult for the volunteers\n[noise] well um it becomes more difficult really for everyone um because\nUh you know we need health and we always need volunteers\nUm you know the the um Thirteen hundred volunteers that I talk about they work two or three weeks shit for\nUm twelve hours a day seven days a week so they go home we have to refreshed and like the volunteers so it can it it does become a bit discouraging when people think it then forgot and not only the IRS people impacted\nAnd of course everything the American Red Cross does\nIs because they can't ... the American public whether they're giving us financial gifts or\nA donating their time to volunteer and I'm sadly Gordon um we had to cancel a lot of blood ties between Hurricane Florence and hurricane Michael because a lot of them were scheduled in those areas\nAnd um we were looking at a bit of a blood shortage right now that we're also encouraging people to donate blood if they're willing to get the gift of life\n... speaking this morning with Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross what's the what's the greatest need at this point is that the blood is it the more volunteers money\nUm yes yes and yeah I Know that um\nYou know what we're really focusing on is providing food shelter water um we're helping people figure out how to navigate through this you know some people\nJust barely got out of their home and that they need their a prescription and treat
