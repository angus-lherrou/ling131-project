I'm On the ballot there are a lot of Democrats and now after defense each day hold against Republican challengers in the mid term election year so we have a lot of ... already sort of in a structural imbalance against the Democrats but\nAt the moment it seems like they're forty nine races in which the Democrats either are up for re election or heavy elite in polling and fifty races in which the Republicans you to hold the seat or at least in polling and then there's one way stories in Tennessee that's essentially tied so the upshot is could go either way\n... [noise] how about a ebbs and flows as I Do know particular issues come to the forefront in any given week does that does that happening\nNot really I mean it was so we've seen for example recent polling in North Dakota which shows the Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble that's not surprising it's North Dakota it's a very red state uh there's been some indication or or or I should say some some\nAh we're cool arguing that a high camp is suffering from support for Kavanaugh that ... that she wasn't immediately on board with a supporting Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nHas been pointing to as a reason that she's a falling behind there but it is a state that the Democrats have consistently had trouble in any way so I'm not sure that's really the case the main thing that we're seeing is partisanship\nThat in states where there are a a where Hillary Clinton won for example Democrats and do well in states that Donald Trump won\nThe new well there are some outliers like West Virginia where Joe mansion still maintains a lead a despite the fact that he's a Democrat in a very red state as a general rule no it doesn't seem to be swayed by ...\n... we're speaking with Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post she's written a piece in Delaware the fight for the Senate stands right now um how much could things change over the course of the next month there was starting to get really locked in here\nTo some extent I mean we were starting to see where races are starting to separate to some extent and what that means is that parties will then stop putting money into those races which means that those races will become even more solidly out whatever color they were training in the first place I guess we're going to see some of that really this is going to come down to a handful maybe five Senate seats\nOn election night which will determine control of the Senate I think the house\nPretty likely to to go to the Democrats at this point in time the Senate continues to be a big question mark\n... what were those that did you ... five thirty eight crunching numbers than they about are the odds of one party cleaning the house in the Senate\nThey did yeah and so those numbers change a lot depending on what polls they get in but essentially it is that Republicans have about a woman by chance of holding the house the Democrats have won five chance of taking the Senate\nOkay so you were to it like the some of the gubernatorial races correct any any notable similarities\nWhat's remarkable about the gubernatorial races is that if you look for example the Senate map and look at the state of pulling there there's a lot of sort of politically areas where the Democrat and Republican or running sort of even\nIf you look at that map though there are a lot of states where there is an incumbent Republican governor who is going to win re election right so you look at a state like a Maryland or Larry Hogan is very popular looks like he's not going to have too much trouble running for reelection even though it's a blue state\nAnd there are a lot of reasons for this one of course is the fact that the Democrats have a map on the side so you're going to see 'em a few were ... great voices they're simply because there aren't a lot of\nYou know strong popular Republicans are up for re election but another too is that there's obviously a big difference between state and federal and so people in Maryland is like Donald Trump but like the job Larry Hogan is doing and Hogan and other Republican governors that represent blue states\nActually came out and said hey let's let's put the brakes on this Kavanaugh nomination which is a sort of thing that you can do as a governor you can't do the Republican Senate\nLike Philip Philip bump at the Washington Post\nWorks on the program is roughly by our friends\nHas dropped by co founder of Microsoft and the ... four hundred list of the richest

and Eighteen flu season was notable for the record breaking levels of flu illness and hospitalization rates throughout the country tragically there were also one hundred eighty Lou related pediatric debts\nReminder of just how serious blue can be as the new flu season approaches time for a review on how best to protect ourselves we're joined by Dr Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville working with the CDC doctor what should we know\nThere's going to be a flu season that's the thing we should all know more severe severe but it will be here how nasty which means now it's time to get vaccinated\nIt's all rolled up our sleeves the recommendations are so simple we don't have to think about if you're older than six months of age yeah\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't want U.S Britain virus this nasty virus ... anybody at work\nIn in your family at home and your house of worship don't be graded spread or\nGet vaccinated [laughter] how difficult is it to create the correct vaccines these days\nWhere we have lots of options there's the standard flu vaccine and for people age sixty five an older this is important because they get more serious complications\nThere are actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them\nOne is called simply the high dose and the other has a fancy name called the ... vaccine that just means there's an immune stimulant in it\nThe pharmacies and doctors' offices almost all have one for the other and that's great for people age sixty five an older and Medicare will pay for it you don't have to worry about that Mm\nI'm do vaccines make it more difficult to battle the flu strains\nVaccines don't make it more difficult in fact they are the single best thing we have available to combat the flu\nAnd we want to ... emphasize people age sixty five an older those younger than eight sixty five we have an underlying illnesses such as diabetes lung disease heart disease or immuno compromised and a special shout out\nTo women who are pregnant and back flu vaccine is safe it protects the pregnant woman\nWomen who are pregnant when they get to have a very high rate of complications have we don't want that\nAnd then there's a bonus the protection they make actually passes a cross the placenta gets into the newborn baby and provides protection to the new baby after its Bork well so that's a bonus\nYeah we're speaking with Dr Bill Schaffner infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville they're working with the CDC as we head into flu season with some tips on preventing flu or any read on what these this season is going to be like who is worse than last year uh not as bad\nBut read is that there will be a flu season beyond that or a crystal ball is cloudy and that's why we just say let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I Would have tried to anticipate or is this going to be a bad one just go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection\nThat flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains within three or four vaccine to very get the one that's in your doctor's office or that the pharmacist recommends\nWhat about uh what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what's you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading others\nYeah so it's it's very simple\nThe CDC has a take three approach get vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people are coughing and sneezing\nAnd if you should get sick don't wait call your health care provider because they may prescribe an anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the illness they get less likely you get complications and make it less likely you'll spread it to others so that's a comprehensive approach\nDr Schaffner
