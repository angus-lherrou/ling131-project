end of the two weeks pay cycle you can hear that report on our website this morning with Gordon Deal dot com or on places like SoundCloud I tune state you're in tune in just search for it this morning\nWhere do we stand on the Trump terrorists Yahoo Finance columnist or ... new man has been doing a deep dive by talking to business owners on the front lines and joins us now tell us what you found out about talking to the owner of a battery business in Texas\nSurveying a lot of different business owners here we go fight as to get their opinions on the terrorists\nAre some don't like them but some actually do like them and one of the guys I interviewed was a guy named queen Robinson who run the company in Texas that rebuilds or industrial equipment or alternate heirs and starters on automobiles and on um some bigger equipment used in the ... energy industry\nAnd he's getting hit from he's a he sees the tears from both sides so\nUm he's he has to pay more now for some materials that he uses his business which is rebuilding or some of this equipment but he also favors the terrorists because he competes against a new equipment new alternatives and starters that are made in China\nSo the price of the competing product is going to go up\nAnd he thinks that's going to help his business eventually he thinks that may actually help him raise his own prices eventually him pay for the higher cost he himself because his own costs have gone up on account of the terrorists so it's complicated I mean that you know the waiters plays out in the real world\nIs not nearly as simple as some of the sound bite you might hear politicians are spouting on TV\n[noise] what kinds of price supplies um is he looking at it is it that the ten percent or higher\n[noise] it's a I think the ones that are affecting him that the cost increases affecting him or the steel and aluminum tariffs\nShow you know he buys some parts from suppliers who in turn to get their stuff from China or a show in some cases their pay either a ten percent ... now an additional temper center works on the twenty five percent tariff also the steel and aluminum tariffs\nUh apply not just to imports from China but from most countries\nSo a imported steel and aluminum is getting more expensive so he got he got notified by one supplier or the price that the price of the product if he needs to purchase is going up ten percent ... percent more for that product and at some point you're going to have to raise his own prices\nA in order to cover that increase in cost but\nYou know there if you're if you're the seller in this case you have to figure out well\nAs my customer going to pay the extra money and how do I sort of carefully raise my prices without of sending my customers away so what he plans to do is he going to eat the it out and cost until he sees the competing products going up in price which it has to do because it's getting more expensive also\nAnd he says well not product goes up the price that is what he's going to raise prices so ah all prices what kind of go at the same time\nWe're speaking with that Yahoo columnist Rick Newman Rick in talking to this gentleman could you tell it all it's his feelings have changed in either direction on the tariffs\n[laughter] that's interesting because when he first um reached out to me saying he'd be happy to talk about that she was totally in favor of the terrorists and that was before he got the notification from his own supplier that his own costs were going up by the time I actually talked to him he said well there's been an interesting turn\nA because yesterday and he said Mr he said yesterday in fact um I got notified by my own suppliers of my costs are going up so I'm paying more on account of the terrorists but I think it's going to help\nOr on the retail and he said look I still favor the Trump terrorists are in one of the points he made is that it his business he has seen a lot of the U.S businesses small businesses such as his own just disappear\nBecause ah they cannot compete with\nA with cheap imported products from China and I'm In many cases they make the case that the court in products are low quality products that there are there they're not built to last um that you get you know if you're the consumer you're getting something inferior\nBut a lot of times uh you just don't know that or you don't care and you know you have to make at some point in time you just have to go with the cheaper products so he's one of these people who feels that the Trump cares may actually rectify a longstanding problem with the demise of all these businesses in the United states\nThanks that's Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman\nPortion of the program is ... by Harry's you've heard Gordon

Michigan business dot org\nWell markets go up and markets go down you can't panic over every move or you'll go crazy so says market watches Maria ... who has some tips for us on how to remain calm amid volatility Maria how can you keep yourself from freaking out\nSo it's obviously hard to do you know this week was really crazy in the markets the Dow fell more than a hundred points on Wednesday so it's easy to get caught up in that but the truth is if you're a relatively young investor you should you know play the long game as history has shown and\nNot get overly panicked about every bad day at the market has\nWhat the problem with constantly checking all your accounts\n[noise] the thing is you know most of us are probably not going to be getting the money out of the account that day so\nWhat you're the number that your account says can either be really exciting or really disappointing but the truth is it's probably far off from what it will be when you actually cash they account out\nI'm at is different obviously for someone that's retiring tomorrow or has another really short term goal but if you are investing for the long term you know the number that it says ten twenty Thirty years before you're ready to have your money out it's not super important\nMaria what's the best way to get money put into your four O. one K. or even Iraq the IRA\nSo many experts say the should just be something that's automatic and so if you haven't signed up for some kind of automatic deposit and cheer for when Karen IRA or something like that um you know definitely try to do that if you're tempted to panic maybe just say okay instead of panicking about where the market today\nCan I look at my budget is there any wiggle room for me to amp up how much I Am contributing to my retirement account and time spent doing now there's a lot better you know time spent than just hyperventilating\nMaria what about the importance we've talked about this a number of times of making a budget and or evaluating a budget you've already made\nYes so it's it's a good time to just take a look over it again I'm it's possible that something that's changed maybe you've gotten a raise or maybe the opposite has happened you know maybe you're\nIn the gig economy any business has been slow lately it so it's always a good time to just kind of reevaluate um you know look at the normal things that their subscription or a cell phone plan you can negotiate on and maybe bring your costs down um all of those things can have really big ripple effects for the future if you can just take the time to do it today\nWe're speaking with Maria lasagna of marketwatch memory of what is the downside of spending money to make yourself feel better when you're stressed out\nYes so if you are trying to distract yourself from the headlines you know maybe try not to treat yourself to a shopping spree or something like that um you know retail therapy can really catch up with you\nA lot of us are already severely in credit card debt I'm the U.S has the you know more than a trillion dollars in credit card debt so it's not a good time to contribute more to that\nUm so you know there's plenty of free things you can do go for a walk you know go for ... even watching TV is better than going on a shopping spree so try to do pretty much anything but that\nAnd with interest rates rising this just a time now to pay off debt if you can\n[noise] exactly so we are going to the interest rates probably arise several times this year or so um you want to get ahead of that before your credit card is charging you even more and interests so if you can pay off as much as you can now that will really pay off later\nOn the positive side of higher interest rates some banks may be paying better rates\nYes that's true so um if you're looking for a new bank account um or even if you're not you probably should just see that they're really great options out there um Goldman Sachs markets that's almost two percent on a savings account which is huge ally bank of another one\nSynchrony bank they all have you know pretty good on line savings rate so if you're getting just the minimum that your normal um you know if you're just thinking at chase or something like that you're a savings account probably doesn't deal that much so look into some of these online banks and see if they can do better for you\nAnd Maria this is a great time to try to find a side gig or another job if you can swing it\nYeah we're also heading into the holiday season though there's some seasonal jobs that you may be able to get 'em or you know go to the normal routes of looking at tax crowded or um drive for Hoover laughter do dog walking babysitting all of those normal things\nThanks Maria Maria ... of
