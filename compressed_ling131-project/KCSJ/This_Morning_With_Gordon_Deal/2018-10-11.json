to strike the U.S humbled houses now trees\nTore down power lines along the Florida Panhandle hurricane Michael a category for when it made landfall near Mexico Beach Florida yesterday ranked as the strongest storm to hit that region since at least eight teen fifty one when recordkeeping began\nMore now from Jonathan ... senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel he's with us lives mourning mourning jobs and just how bad was Michael\n... morning Gordon yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know a Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the U.S still tend to either hold serve or the week and a little bit as they approach land but Michael is\nIntensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and it's I was with making landfall\nSo yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and ... the to give you a perspective on that or they're only been three or continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened here by rain\n[noise] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is now just over a year or go to Georgia and spread it all of its rainy into a parts of the Carolinas\nMia Appalachians and or over the next twenty four hours it will just move a pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nIn the southeast Virginia and spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a south east New England they produce an inch of rain or so on its northern blanket to New York city in Philadelphia\nBut fortunately by friday or this thing will finally be able to see will be done with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[laughter] well that's true you know uh you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage or think of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans it didn't hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston uh so it's a it's a relatively lower population swat in the ... still hit very hard\nBut ah I guess if there was a small solar relieve a certainly as far as the the the the overall damage figure from this is that it hit a relatively unpopulated area of the Gulf Coast\nYeah why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that shouldn't be the case you to Florida is good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\n[noise] yeah I mean part of it is part of it is due to becoming so intense so ah so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensifying that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this they usually put\nA watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of times and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance uh but uh\nI think the intensity and ferocity of it uh you know I\nI personally did not expect the borderline cat five later today so I think that may have been a factor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks well\nYou know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left that typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems out in the central and eastern Atlantic not worry about the Wesleyan the deed\nOr there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay up buried in Central America and that could be a flood threat so you don't see any us threats or over the next week or so but again the hurricane seasons do can go into November leaks do could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November Man that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for about the last um the last two weeks of August through early October that's when you get the the worst of the hurricanes and the biggest threat to the United states\nOr just because of the warm water in the low wind shear that's when the ... that's when you tend to see the peak impact we can still get big hurricanes and tropical storms early in the seat in the late in the city but uh there's certainly a prime time it's almost like the kind of race in baseball almost mats of exactly what that\nHer to good hey I thanks for a few minutes is always appreciated in crisis situations we call on Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist
