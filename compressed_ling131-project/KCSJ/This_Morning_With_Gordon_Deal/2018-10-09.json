too with one hundred mile an hour sustained winds could be a cap three when it hits tomorrow\nAnd as unhealthy as he has no plans to fire deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein president yesterday gave a vote of confidence to the number two man and the Justice Department even after reports that he had discussed secretly recording the president and mounting an effort to remove him from office\nMeanwhile there's a kind of split screen display of the two most senior justice officials attorney general Jeff Sessions\nAnd the so called gag the deputy attorney general Mr Rosenstein systems for Mr Sessions' recusal from any investigation into President Trump's twenty sixteen campaign\nYet the lack of direct involvement has also provided space for Mr sessions to execute an agenda on immigration criminal justice in other areas with far less distraction or scrutiny than usual\nHere's Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD Grumman city what are we seeing\nIt was very noticeable that Rosenstein to tag and you know sessions the attorney general we're having a very different experiences leading the Justice Department you know while a Rosenstein was so into the White House an answering questions about the uh\nYou know the Russia investigation going to the hill and answering questions about you know this trove of documents that Republicans in Congress were seeking sessions was just basically traveling the country and beyond a happy about things like violent crime and terrorism\nAnd as time has gone on that has become more apparent including when it is actually say that it's traveling to the international cheap the police station conference\nIn Orlando with trout a that is something that would be very close to a session heart\nAs somebody who is a big fan of local law enforcement that he's in France for the G ... summit so it just kind of an interesting little reality for both of them\nWell these are the conservatives are pleased with what sessions has done\nI think they wouldn't normally be pleased with what sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set at sessions like trumpet for stepping aside from the Russia investigation ads for you know just allowing Mueller's investigation to progress as\nIt has so I think in any other sort of environment a session to prioritize immigration and violent crime and that you know drug policies um you know we're getting credit from conservative but that's not necessarily happening at the time\nWhen I say you were speaking with Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD girl and she's written a piece titled the split screen existence of Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein used it to that ah there's going to be a renewed focus on immigration in the coming weeks for Mr sessions\nWell that that um actually I think that's still true uh that was a stray that was written back in may but um and that we really thought migration burst onto the seat after that but I think that's still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think right now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the midterm story right now is about you know whether\nTrump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to write that on their own accord so it just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAh all yes for both for all of them and the president they get you know our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get along fairly well at Rosenstein has done a pretty good job of keeping the present appealing but president in such a way that he's been able to keep his job\nAnd continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president is totally true rated for that little bit different\nWhen you said of Mr Rosenstein and Mr sessions often talk about other things that are happening in that agency\nYeah it's I think when they're together they're talking about day to day affairs you know what is going on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean sessions has recused from that so you know he's not getting briefed he's not getting a you know updates about the investigation\nIt's interesting fascinating stuff what else uh jumped out at you as you were pulling all this together\nBut I just think it's interesting that you know sessions which you know not only really damaged his relationship with Trump but just kind of\nUm you know separated him from his the department that heat lead\nAt a time when it's getting involved in some of the biggest you know stories of the day like immigration I guess well Rosenstein and hit the answer to a lot of the complaint from Trump and his allies session has really gotten sort of executed agenda you know peace in relative quiet because the focus is on ride and what he's doing\nAnd says sessions has kind of just been you know traveling talking to a local law enforcement grew I'm getting that he really likes and stay out of the cauldron of

... debates Wall Street journal reporter shipped cutter has been sampling workplaces in and says the stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice have made this moment notably personal ... what have you found\nPolitics have really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example uh that that they weren't having really kind of intense conversations with some of their colleagues\nWe have examples in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault um one CEO how to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political debates we're getting too heated of a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something that really couldn't be avoided at work\nGoodness I I mean it did it cause enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\n[laughter] well we heard I talked to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to her tone as a group of men in front\nOf her work walking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to suddenly redirected conversations their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work\nThat that that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right you eat it at work void religion politics things like that\nFor a long time this is politics have stay out of work for a number of people told us that they don't but it's it's no longer possible that you you do bring them selves to the office\nThat the issues that you're you're discussing outside of work of course are going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made the point that we don't we don't have a third place for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called the Bateman group and they have offices in New York and San Francisco and a partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had to deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker them they'd had had to set up for the past year\nThe flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers there to really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want to engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates on what was happening and this was a good form for them and do it out\nThat while we're speaking with just cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the work place I can imagine to some managers are no may not be worse than having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nDetroit I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia\nAnd he said that he's had to tell his his small team that there really is just no please for political bickering network he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he could take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that\nUm I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see what happens is we can determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps\nUm but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door just try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have\nAn open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we'll go from there\nHow much of this uh boils down to gender battles\nWell I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are some ... these are gender issues that but I think that we we heard on\nOn all sides of this that they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think and then we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they did not feel that uh just kept an eye was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really [laughter]\nAcross gender lines across guy economic lines up with something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and it of course played out of work where we spend so much more time\nWhen he's chip all Street Journal reporter ship cutter it's twenty
