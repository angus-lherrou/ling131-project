revved up liberal base or target centrist voters by campaigning on the more modest school of fixing the Obama era health law polling indicates that new issue is more important to voters than health care and Wall Street journal reporter Stephanie Armour says this internal tension carries risk Stephanie what are we seeing\nWell actually what you've seen is as the mid term elections get closer and closer in November that Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken off far more than even the supporters of it expected like they were they taught us that something more for the twenty twenty\nPresidential elections and it\nKind of emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policies such as Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrats crafts especially in conservative states that are like whoa we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more a kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle and the debate that's playing out right now\nBoy who supports this ah well I'm ... this is obviously the idea was first I'm kind of brought forth by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really it's it's a Medicare for all that is a single payer\nHas now at this point a gardener um sixteen or actually Fifteen core sponsors because Al Franken drunk or on there and um there's now a Medicare for all ... in the house\nI you're seeing a lot of um sort of the more younger newer faces who are challenging incumbents who are supporting us and also in in a lot more of the liberal states you're seeing that you know become a real talking point in Minnesota I'm with dean fill up\nAnd then on the Democratic side as well who is saying well well well we need to go easy here\nI think it's the um uh individuals like men for example who ran who didn't fully come out in support of Medicare for all\nYou see people like I'm In West Virginia who are ... a mansion who is um you know taking a much more cautious approach a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do is fix the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bathwater\n... speaking with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour or pieces gold some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan itself play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when you when the parents go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the support is strikingly high\nAround Seventy percent but you know the Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interest of the brain theaters plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think up single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all isn't even among the Democrats\nThere's you know widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare is what the options even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think that was going to hit the road as that goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace a theater that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support Medicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI don't know what it would go so far as to say it's a good at running program that I think they\nThey are building on the ... the popularity of Medicare itself which has you know high\nApproval rating some its beneficiaries and conserve has a positive connotation the public\nAnd I also think they that they see this as a way to expand health care coverage to everyone on as well as a way to ah ah lord us health care spending which I Would say the the critics of it being manly disagree with\nMedical groups would rally against that I presume because there'd be less money for them\nYeah there is that the federal government generally in almost all cases pays a lower reimbursement rate for care and um private payer such as insurance companies do their concern obviously about lower reimbursement but also\nThey're looking at it as okay let's see you overhaul the complete healthcare system they're saying that this is going to mean what were the last my coming into hospitals which then will cause massive job losses in the industry is their argument or their concerns", "show_name": "This Morning
