whether Democrats will live up to expectations of winning back the house and can defy the odds to take control of the Senate but for some smoke signals about President Trump's reelection chances\nTo swing state governor races will offer tantalizing clues about the public's tolerance for progressive is when the alternative is electing Kennedy to emulate the attitude of the president so says Josh cross harp politics editor at National Journal Josh how do you see it\nWhen you want to look at how a twenty twenty presidential election might shape up\nIt's really instructive to look at the sort of laughter versus right governor's race is taking place in swing diverse backgrounds and I'm Talking about Florida\nGeorgia and even Arizona to a to a lesser extent where you have you know in in the in the Florida race you've got a Bernie Sanders candidate running against the Trump endorsed Republican it's a Florida is one of the most a bellwether state for the country and the rate is extremely close\nIf someone like Andrew Gillum ... will be the first African American governor Florida if if if if he win that race and he's a very progressive candidate\nHe would send a message to Democrats in twenty twenty book we can win the electoral college we can win the presidency with a very liberal candidate against against President Trump or there's a path with a victory even nominate someone who is a little bit outside the mainstream ...\nMm So is the same thing true in Georgia where you've got Stacey Adams running\nThe verbs yeah Julia is a a another great example where you have two candidates claimed to to the bases are ... you know and then the primary especially with talking about how she wanted to build a new coalition\nOf voters in Georgia and not just relying on sort of a swing\nAtlanta voter that off and make up the difference of course George election she wanted to get new are largely African American voters took a poll and create a new electorate or to help Democrats win the big bad for big gamble and she definitely has the windows are backing that good democratic year but she's running neck and neck with the Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp\nWho was again a Trump endorsed candidate someone who's very very conservative especially on social and cultural issues and uh you know there's also a big battle over over voting rights than in the state where I'm you know he he at secretary of state camp went after Abrams for something to organize and tried to get new voters registered to vote in the future so\nAgain this is a polarized electorate left versus right and that state that is the lead legal Republican but it's one of those days the Democrat but they can compete in in years to come\n... received Josh cross our politics editor at National Journal these pieces called battle of the bases will set the tone for twenty twenty you point out in the story too about the risk of running left\nYeah I mean the conventional wisdom and I I I buy the conventional wisdom is that when you go to carnival after going to alienate those swing moderate voters a typical it makes a difference in in competitive elections that Democrats are betting on it I I can understand why what what area of the cases\nThey think this is such a good democratic environment there's such a ... you know here's a guy called anger especially among suburban voters that it may not matter who Democrats nominate they might be able to nominate someone who is a little bit\nTo the left or by the suburban voters are so so uh you know\nHave such a problem with President Trump they look at the Republican Party and wonder where it's going and then they just straight Democratic Party ticket right when they vote on a strict party ticket and the Democrats so environment and if you want to have a candidate that's going to be a little more progressive than normal this is the type of political environment Democrats Woodward would a would achieve that goal\nThat gets to I Believe your point about this competing culture clashes you call it in the Trump era\nYeah I mean this is the middle of this or\nYou know the the time for a century the timer moderation is is that here and twenty teens which Trump is rallying his base Democrats are playing to the resistance\nI there's not much room for something like a like a ... brat as it was a former Democratic governor in Tennessee you're trying to run to the middle or he's finding that it's hard to the to the center of the people want to take sides on the left ...\nExplain what's happening in Arizona than that so somewhat similar maybe to Florida in Georgia\nYeah this is starting to see the Republican incumbent ... can't not as Trump be ... to ... to other Republican so it's a little bit different but again running against the uh his guy ... they would they would go see it will be the first Hispanic governor in Arizona and in over forty years\nAnd go see it again I'm especially immigration which is a very touchy issue in Arizona where voters are much more conservative on border security and migration issues\nAnd he's Josh Josh cross our politics editor at National Journal

has on top of the list and the New York area Brooklyn which isn't too small a is number two but we have Raleigh Durham Orlando Nashville Austin\nA Boston Denver Charlotte and Tampa saint Pete which is near the top ten so the big trend that we're observing here Gordon that smaller cities are more interesting to real estate investors and the larger ones\nAnd why is that any reason\nIt's really it's sort of a combination of economic and demographics a German demographics perspective a younger folks are wanting to live there\nAnd that's the future for the employment base and then the economic side staying with employment employment base in those cities and to be very stable and growing she'll Racine growing population growing employment wearing a virtuous cycle in terms of people are willing to work there and what we're observing ... and the economy is lead\nSinger such a tight labor market with ... unemployment rate\nUh jobs ... people not the other way around show when jobs are chosen people to cities you find a lot of real estate investment opportunity that's what the common thread of cross virtually all of them\nSo you mentioned the younger folks looking at these smaller type cities is that because they might be more affordable in addition to having jobs\nYeah no question any sort of building Gordon extends not only to young people who want to work there and start careers and start families which also for double in terms of doing business many cities are considerably more affordable\nThan their big city counterparts and in terms of retirees are empty nesters some of
