been a category for landfall along this part of the Florida Panhandle or the Big Bend Florida you know we're bands of ...\n... any historical records dating to the mid nineteenth century so what we're seeing today is truly an unprecedented event\nWas it a surprise that a jump to a category for\nWell you know I'd have to admit uh looking at this last week we were expecting at least a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico but uh you know I I'd have to be honest I was not expecting a category for landfall\nUm you know it's just basically been such very or go to Mexico water temperatures in just some some optimal wins a law that allows the such rapid rising motion in the ... the hurricane and it's just take it off in the Gulf of Mexico far beyond what I expected it\nWell so ... would be roughly what middle middle of the afternoon\nIt looks it looks like the eye of a of Michael should make landfall in the early afternoon\nNow are somewhere between Panama City beach in Appalachia cola

so long or ever but I like listen I'm up in New Jersey so I think Gulf of Mexico I think hurricanes big storms ... why I guess not those area [noise]\nYeah you would think so I mean I I'm I'm looking right now at a map of all the historical category for hurricane tracks the Gulf of Mexico and you know there there's been a number of them that have hit the Alabama Gulf Coast the Mississippi Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas and South Florida\nBut there's just this strange gap a from a north of Tampa or through say Appalachian coal and Panama City that has not seen it has not seen a category for landfall and it's sometimes it's just the steering wheel in the atmosphere that when you get the really intense hurricanes like this\nThey tend to go further south and then further west in the
