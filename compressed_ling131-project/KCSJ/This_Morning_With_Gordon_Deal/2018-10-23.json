Holmes the house Judiciary Committee here's Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard Eric what's up here\nRight now we've got a whole crush of people being called before congressional committees to testify about the FBI and the Jay's actions before the two thousand sixteen election\nThese are investigations that have been going on for a while but now all of a sudden there's a time pressure on getting people to come in and testify\nBefore those committees and it all comes down to the mid term elections which is there's an expectation that probably you know Republicans have a three out of for a chance of losing the ... the uh the house\nA majority this year and what they lose if they lose a majority of the crucial thing an investigation is it's up to the chairman of the house committee to issue subpoenas sort of on his or her own\nUm say so and so you you meet the subpoena power to force people to come in and talk\nTo give testimony and in the Senate the chairman of a Senate committee needs the agreement of the ranking member of the other party to issue a subpoena so you don't have the same kind of power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose the house they really lose that power to force people to come in to testify\nWow so the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigations have to see the way to the end\nOf the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes than the power over what the majority puts out as a report changes immediately and show\n'em power of having a congressional um leadership both in the big picture and in each individual committee\nI'm really determines what that committee does it's it's not like with the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with his investigation regardless of who's in power and Congress\nOr speak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will affect Congress's investigations are what are the Democrats in the house said they'll probe if they gained the majority after November\nWell you know you've got in the house intelligence committee instead of Devin Nunes has you'll have it being run by Adam shifts and he's made it very clear that he will be\nI'm pursuing allegations of money laundering from the Trump Organization so that's what his focus will be and you'll have over in the house oversight committee I'm Alive Cummings will be in charge there\nAnd a Jerrold Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those are the three committees that then primarily looking at a investigations a shift has made it clear that um\nIs money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side\nThat any investigation into abuses by the FBI and the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election um those will disappear from the house side\nWould have Republicans hold the house then what happens\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only\nHave kind of new life but they'll have a new energy that will come from having been racing to get 'em ... witnesses before the committee's [laughter] you know the things had been moving along\nAt a store to steady pace with everything else going on in the house and so all of a sudden they have a lot more time at their disposal but they've done a bunch of\n'em raced to the finish interviews that'll put them in a

called the Phoenix center and not leave which is just sweat that New York city\nAnd I guess what interested to see how hard the staff work to keep the students come and get them out of the building um you know school shootings\nYou know they're obviously way too many of them but they're still rare I mean it is unlikely that the school will be\nTargeted but at the state law to practice and so they do and they take it very seriously and um [noise] you know it's it's a lot of work when you have students who have severe autism Down syndrome or their behavioral challenges some of them are\nThe

I think that the school has a relationship with the police department in town and so that you know police officers know out in a kind of didn't that attend\nThe drill that I didn't have first responders there but um you know with such a high staff to student ratio I I think that the uh you know the staff would be largely in charge of the students in the first responders I imagine would be instructing the staff\nBut I I that's a good question and some of these students are are very I'm\nTerrified by noises and they're they're really crave consistency so something like a trail that gets them outside of what they're used to can be hard for some of them yet\nTo that point I I think you mentioned there was one student who sort of froze when he got to a doorway and didn't necessarily want to go outside of that time\nRight and some other male staffer ... where I used to him doing that it's it's happened before so they very quickly kind of came up with him and skip their arms under
