a reverse the trend where you'd see where the economy got better and better each\nSuccessive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nYou referenced it in a couple of your remarks there but this was a solid economy right to wages are creeping up ah the the tax cuts for more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth of household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up at the last few years\nThat was initially when we started looking at five or five years or so ago that was the top ... and people limited they're spending it was like as their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that as\nA income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case that was the reason people were holding back and instead people were saying well I'm holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin but a couple of other things that that they're watching the percentage of Americans that point too\nToo much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years and I think that's consistent\nWith a rising interest rate environment that better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens coupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people out there are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we even in a solid economy there's there there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back as soon as the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about my generation what's that break down\nYeah you know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and the inclination to save more as the reason for rolling back\nSkew younger so millennials in particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend ... also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to say more money\nBut that's changing ... baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers it better in the workforce\nStagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is a recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say\nOh what a generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this in a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination\nTowards saving a they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations and I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of older millennials or\nSeen the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings are just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it's that that focus on saving limiting the spending in order to save more money\nLike Greg Greg McBride chief financial analyst at ... dot com twenty minutes in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning
