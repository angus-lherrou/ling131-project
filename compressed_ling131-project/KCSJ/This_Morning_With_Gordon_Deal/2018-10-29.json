weighed in decades for a reliably\nConservative Supreme Court or knocking on the buildings bronze doors but after historically partisan confirmation by the justice is made on answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happens with abortion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways it can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding that cetera\nAnd then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts um strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they um um allow them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be\nSupreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do as much as they possibly can and these cases his spot them down and say we're not going to take them or whatever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand [noise]\nSo that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but it points you can say now it seems like a good time\nAnd it's like well yeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about ...\nPercent of those and the cases it takes a rider important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts those are the federal appeals court to the level right below the Supreme Court\nAnd they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue\nAnd one or two or three Supreme Court ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases coming to the court on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can actually say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now and these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands report\nJust wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year\nSimply doesn't want to do anything that might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well please\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply
