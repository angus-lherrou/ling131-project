call to thirtieth going\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might see three has actually traveling and I ran out of it\nSo what happened to me that you know I'm basically a pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand and go what is this this is weird but then I realized that I'd run out of ... formula and I went off of it for several weeks and I'm the minute I started\nGoing on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know somebody's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best tests that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nYou go I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it the next time you give out the number to have people order as it's called ... in order it I Know you mentioned it's a risk ... go ahead and try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then I don't doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks that want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nThen as we've been talking about Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a staff dissolving melt that's available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results and by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and keep in mind folks Dr paint gives his arranged a very special offers it's only available to you listeners so when you do call be shared a mentioned this program and\nYou'll

if you call right now you qualify for an extra free supply with your order to keep yourself or share it with a family member or friend but\nYou must call now because this special radio off or is not available in stores or on line so the number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nAnd keep in mind you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back\nAnd when you do call and order you'll not be enrolled in any of those monthly subscription programs as a one time order folks so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and occupying is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly it's not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nThat what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprises me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the ball and we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first\nTwenty something years I practice I never prescribed vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nCan you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the her but you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home I though it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength can you do three formula help with that yeah\nIt's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nYou're seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down first it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting slums they physically and then at the lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that sets this setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula\nSo if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain fibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nSo of course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take it what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Chris\nAnd who would I and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamin D three and he went back in three months later and his blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid result in by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains\nAnd again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offered that's only available to your listeners today so when you do call please be sure to mentioned this program and you're going to get a risk free trial of Dr ... says vitamin D three again this is only available to your listeners\nAnd only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you'd call right now you also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend\nBut you must call right now because the special radio offer is not available in stores or on line so that number to call is one eight hundred for six

seniors and those of us it loved them on your o.s day returning again\nThis weekend on news talk five ... case he is Jay\nAnd I hurt radio and loved to have you join us we've got the topics that affects seniors all over the globe this is the longest running showed America so we are glad that you're with us and today we're going to be a a talking about something very interesting and uh\nUh typically when we age we sometimes withdraw from the things that we love and we think we're no longer useful\nAnd I've got a special guest that's going to tell you otherwise and so there are great opportunities out there we used to justice and who's a coach for entrepreneurs source is with us and we're going to talk about if you're a senior there are some great opportunities to continue to understand who you are\nWhat you are and make sure that you could be out and do something exciting good morning Lisa great to have you on the show\nGood morning Dave I'm so excited to be here good to have you here and I think this topic is just wonderful for us and and uh hey I'm sixty one hey I'm I'm a family or we go\nAnd uh we're the kind of aging folks that are that need to listen to the store so\nWell good let's let's find out a little bit more about what you do and then we'll talk about how our listeners can relate to what it is you specialize it\nAbsolutely I'm an alternative career coach I'm with the entrepreneurs source there from that's thirty four years old with coaches located across North America and I have an office here in southern Colorado in Pueblo and I work with people locally including in Colorado Springs Pueblo and\nI'm canyon city and so forth but I also work with people a nationally and I get to have the opportunity of actually working with people on their dreams looking at possibilities option and dreams\nCreating a life that they've always wanted and looking for self sufficiency and financial freedom you know Seventy five percent of the adult population Dave desires to be self sufficient um however\nMany of us don't know where to start including me up until several years ago I always wanted to be self sufficient independent but I didn't know where to go so I get to work with people who want to go on a journey of discovery\nSo you never too old to become an entrepreneur\nI was I was in my early fifties and actually it looked like\nThe worst thing in the world it happened to me I'd been with a fortune five hundred company actually they were in the top twenty uh and had been with them for twelve years very successful had a multi state team\nAnd uh the company decided to go in a new direction and so my position across the enterprise was eliminated and so here I was with this company that's a hundred and sixty years old thinking I'm safe\nYou know nothing's going to happen here I'm going to have my benefits I'm if I wanted to retire here I could uh I'm going to keep stacking up that four one K. and then lo and behold\nThey eliminated all of the people in my position and got rid of the position and distributed our responsibilities to I'm younger less tenured people and so I sat there and thought\nWell my gosh if this could happen at this point in time right is it safe to go back into these\nCorporations that you feel like I'm you're going to stay with forever and earn that golden parachute so to speak\nAnd so this was great for you a new career and coaching\nPeople helping them find of the special qualities the experiences that they have to enable them to the you know sort of walk with them while they're broadening their capacity and broadening their perspective\nUsually when these things happen\nThen it's a window of reflection at the time when people are looking and saying\nWhat else is out there and they start to look at those those dreams of being their own boss and doing their own thing and believe it or not there are so many people our age that this is happening to them in the traditional vehicle of having a job and working for a corporation\nUm often times they've been very successful and then something happens with the the company and they're going to go their own way and their position is eliminated and they're sitting there going oh my gosh\nThey've got gas in the tank you've got so much experience they have so many skills and so I get to work with people\nWho want to nurture their dream of being their own boss and being financially independent\nThat's exciting for those of you are listening I mean\nA lot of times we get compartmentalized in our in our daily operations you know you look at southern Colorado and many people were raised with the bill and yes or you've been working for the company and you know there's been so many changes because\nThere are just like leaves a story where the company made of a giant change that affected her so many of us in our fifties and sixties or know affected by Corp stretch they look even have a discussion of terrorists you know and and and those downstream effects of taxation can cause a company to change strategy\nOvernight absolutely you know and that happens so frequently now I mean there there was in America's history you know up until forty years ago people stayed with the company for fifty years and they had pensions\nAnd those pensions than afforded them a lifestyle when they left the company that was similar to when they were working on the seventies for one case took over and they were meant to supplement\nThe pensions but they ended up taking over and you know fidelity came out with a report saying that forty eight percent of people our age basically boomers from fifty for all the way up to Seventy four\nHaven't socked away enough to retire comfortably and so um you know looking at that realm of going the corporate route you can do it again but there's no guarantee that\nThat you're going to be there that you're going to be safe because the companies can go in a new direction and it is very commonplace now that they balance the books by eliminating positions and my ... my joy is telling people\nTheir other way you know you can come and explore being your own boss and you can do it in a safe Rome where there's no obligations and there's no risk and you know our group our generation wants to do that Dave and ...\nAnd they want to still be productive I mean this is the generation that created the term workaholic and I don't want to lay down and go you know work on their golf swing I mean at least not the majority of the days\nYou know it's funny too because I'm a the diesel retirement and that whole discussion of ... because when it was uh when it was about corporations people really were focusing on retirement no you talk to seniors you talk to people that are in their sixties seventies\nEven eighties there not retiree they're staying doing what they love and then when you do what you love you live longer and and that's the ... the way that people are looking at it now\nAnd ... and you know the really neat thing is about perhaps up until now it's like what we call you one point out kind of like research and development maybe you've hone those skills and develop new talents by going the route of working for a corporation I did for Thirty years I worked with Lou chip\nFortune five hundred companies and I hand my leadership by hand my skills I learned so much but when this window reflection\nWhich was forced open on me you know I didn't know it on my own it cost me to look at my dream of be my own boss and owning my own business and then I actually went through this discovery this journey of discovery with another coach\nShe took me under her wing and she goes let's nurture that dream of doing your own thing and USA Today said that sixty percent\nOf the baby boomers don't want to retire and that makes so much sense because think about the ... 'cause that was in this generation that generation I mean you know\nGoal oriented Japan or an independent right making things happen and they don't want to just lay down their ready to go and the and the great news is that you know you can't have an opportunity to get back and look at that dream of being self sufficient through business ownership\nWell there's a really good discussion ... the vehicle for me as I\nAs I was changing careers the vehicle me for me was franchising yes and so when as many of you know uh I own the visiting angels franchise here in southern Colorado for about sixteen years\nDon't ever know but I'm Still a corporate executive with the visiting angels corporate team and so that vehicle of franchising is a very good vehicle for people our age\nTo get involved with the system works the people that can help you and you just have to\nLet people like Lisa help you find out what is it I really want to do because that's the big question isn't\nIt is the big question and one of the things that that the coaching session does is that we don't want it to find you a job we don't want to get you another job we will find we want to find a vehicle\nThat's wonderful to because you've reached a point of clarity\nIs right and I'm Talking to your listeners right now because a lot of you are my age and many of you are older\nAnd you're thinking hey man I'd done it's all washed up I waited for Social Security and the bottom line is you know we have entrepreneurs out there that are ... that are running ... companies I'm slowly or people that are just starting at my age of sixty one they're just starting ... and they'll be doing that for Twenty years as long as you're alive\nSo it really is never too late to discover\nWhere your gifts are absolutely any now are expected life\nIs eighty five years old now I mean so what are you going to do with that time and think about things like leaving a legacy for your kids I mean what if you want it to you know and ... well this was the big thing that I thought about my daughter\nIs entering her senior year of college and I've been talking to her I was talking to her last year oh my gosh you're halfway there you know you're going to be senior these are the wonderful things I can see you\nTraveling the world and you know she's a photographer a photo journalist is a journalist and stuff and I said I can see you out there being a contract writer on travel around it and I was talking all these dreams\nAnd I was applying for positions\nThat made me go to sleep when I thought of him and I thought hey what about our dreams\nAnd how we telling our kids you go live the dreams in the life that you want and yet we're sitting here and what are we do eat where soccer if I were were settling day were settling for us you know and yet that that really let it only sign of always wanted to be\nGoing on it to be a business owner and when this elimination my position happened my eighty three year old mother\nWho had always heard my dream of being a business owner basically said well you better get on it it looks like this is your time\nThat's right that's right well tell you what if you're listening to the show right now I'm this may be a chance for you to just to think about is that me do I still have ... to become a business owner where to find out when we get back we're taking

there what's what's what are people looking at a service is what are some of your thoughts of it\nI'm slowly so you know for for this generation of fifty four to Seventy four you know they are like I said baby boomers goal oriented independent I mean these are the things they're known about and these are attributes that make people successful in business ownership\nDo a business model and you know some of the top five boomer friendly opportunities and why they make sense for people our age include things like how ... franchises and so how ... it ... the actual business runs the gamut I mean it could be staffing it could be\nCoaching ... it could be home inspection\nBut you know these things first of all baby boomers we went to work forever and goes corporate offices writing for some of us you know that's a that's a four letter word now corporate office because we are not happy anymore with corporations you know some having it in your home right\nBeing home base self it gives you flexibility if you are one of these people that have a\nSandwich generation you maybe have older people living with the older family members and also your younger ones is your flexibility on but also at least let you ramp up fast\nBecause you're startup cost is lower you don't have brick and mortar right you don't have the employee maybe you're the commodity All right and there's a variety of services that we have you know like you said it could be um it could be property management different things like that you bought\nA couple of ways I look at external people that are social their marketers their connector and then there's internal people which is just as valuable\nBut they're the people that do the crust and the ... the ... the detail work that all of us can't do and send it really kind of fall into those areas and it's people like use our heads people like to talk to people you know what I mean it's kind of an interesting gossip\nAnd just because it's that's how does that mean that it's um does it mean that they're sitting on the couch it could be that they're based at home but then they're out in the community ... another great one is tutoring\nThere are so many tutoring opportunities out there um where you go out and you pour into the next generation you know the baby boomers we're the ones that were right in the thick of the civil rights movement believing in empowering people and getting on\nAnother one is senior care franchises no that one you know that one very well known when the staffing in recruiting I mean this generation we were in the hiring we

alternate independence and you're living today is brought to you by visiting angels and the other five boxers now here's your o.s Dave or inter league [noise]\nYeah absolutely and I like you know a lot of times when you're working your job your whole life you're compartmentalized what somebody says you could or what somebody says you do\nAnd so when you become an entrepreneur there so little bit of fear connected with that but that thing you can kick those walls though and that ball that box doesn't have to be a box we can be whatever you make it it could be as big as you want it to be and you just need people to encourage you through it\nAnd that's one of the the really neat things about the coaching experience that we offer you know we offer education about alternative vehicles\nOut there that you might not know about\nAnd we help you through that vehicle looking at things that maybe you you wouldn't have considered on your own or didn't even know about on your own you know there's thirty eight hundred business models out there in eighty five different industries you know people see the fast\nFood ones and they think oh that must be the only thing that some franchising\nBut you know that that's only like seven or eight percent of all franchises and um I mean there's just so many opportunities\nAnd then we also offer awareness we're going to look at things like what's important to us what's important in our age you know we might want the flexibility we might have a grand kid at home or we might have our parent at home and so maybe we want the flexibility to work from home\nAnd so that we can be around to help out\nOur wonderful family members\nBut also do our business it could also be that you want flexibility\nRight to determine your own schedule so what we do is we look at awareness about what's really important to you and then we go on a journey of discovery and what we do is we get you in touch with people\nWho have the lifestyle income and wealth and equity that you want and then we have you talk with them in a safe environment so that you could see how they did it and see if it's an option for you\nThat's really great but

you happen to be out on Saturday Sunday Morning we'd love to have you uh\nMake an appointment with us and we're here every weekend when in fact Montgomery and Stewart funeral directors for underwriting our show along with visiting angels we appreciate the great support to the community\nAnd the many years of a service of both companies so so thank you for that or a special guest ... and really right up my alley we used to justice and is a is as a coach and she helps you through a ... D printer source\nTo discover what it is that amber that burns for something to do that's unique to what your gift to do that takes your experience\nThat takes ... you know the the resource of time which is much more valuable to the resource of money but the resource of time and helps us to point towards accomplishing something that really resonates in our in our lives is that I say that right Lisa\nOnly it's about nurturing that that dream those possibilities options of being self sufficient of being financially independent nurturing that dream of being your own boss in doing your own thing\nWe talked about being your own boss so let's let's go to ... so that we can broaden people's understanding of what's really out there I mean this guy is the limit\nIn in terms of franchising there are hundreds of them in many different sectors some of which you got to buy a big building for some of them you've got to serve food in many of them you can do from your own home\nAbsolutely you know there's thirty eight different models as we discussed earlier right and only eight to nine percent of them are ... are fast food but we think of that 'cause when we're driving around that's what we see but you know there's a lot of different models out there and I love what you talked about earlier when you when you think of what a franchise\nIs a business model and that includes things like licenses and distributors ships um you know it's basically what I call a system and if you think of the acronym s y S T e M save yourself significant time energy and money and that's one of the reasons why\nI Love this business is because people who want to take control their destiny can ramp up fast\nThey can really the go quicker because a business model has already been established to an audit of overtime tweaked in and brought up\nUm and there's just so many different things out there for people to look at and\nAs well said I mean it is a team sport and I've told so many people they said well I Want to do this business but I'm going to do it on my own yeah um and it takes sometimes three four times longer to do it yourself but it does to\nTo to get in capitalize it get a team working with you and take off fast and and that three or four years of time you use to grow something and you could do it in half that time you take a look at the resources that you pick up\nAnd the momentum that you gained so ... is a great way to fix or to interrupt\nYou know absolutely and you know doing start up completely from the ground up there are people out there that can do it and they're very successful at\nIt this is just a different model um for me it's about efficiency I have a I have a girlfriend that she can she can create a financial platform a marketing platform and operational platform you know an HR platform I mean she can do all that from the ground up and you know ... you know hats\nOff to her um but for me I'm like I\nTalk to him about a financial system oh my goodness no way I mean so so for me having these platforms and having them tweaked in audited and already that's what really that's what really is good and you know basically when you look at franchises people think that they have to have the technical skills Dave\nLike you were in visiting angels where were you a gerontology\nAir force officer and I'd never even been into a hospital where'd your pilot yeah well I did television shows for the year for I'm willing to fly but but you know what the system helps you to learn those skills\nAbsolutely and that's what people think they think that you have to have the technical skills but most of the time there's only two skills you really need to have success in a business model and run it well and that is managing operations and following a system and that's because\nYou know you're not always in the business you can be working on the business\nBut you know the really neat thing about it is that the clients that we work with and you know this is the meat thing there is no cost to work for me or work with me no cost whatsoever there's no arrest has no obligation I get to work with people all the time he just want to go on a journey of discovery to look at\nBusiness ownership and is it is that right for them is it the vehicle for them to get those possibilities options and dreams that Ninety five percent of the clients we work with\nGo online to in a business that they wouldn't have considered on their own war had looked at him prematurely dismissed\nAnd part of that is because they don't know everything else is out there and part of it is because we back into it we look at\nWhat are the things you want in income lifestyle wealth in equity we don't want you to buy a job yeah we want you to have the benefits that you want\nSo that's good I I think that you know this discovery process in everybody's life is the light bulb that comes on and you're sitting here saying you're willing to do this for free\nTo learn

of scientists and these guys they know their stuff and they're using this technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder and once they do that they put it in this vast dissolving melt for immediate absorption and quick results that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr bank is from people that are taking your fast smell the three\nOh I'm getting tons
