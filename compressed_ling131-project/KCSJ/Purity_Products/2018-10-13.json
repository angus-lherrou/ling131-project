talking about it in between here and yes it has hit the industry fewer buyers are actually making purchases across the country\nAnd we're saying how how much of that is because of the interest rate so that's already had is hit if you will on the residential interest and continues as we know the rates are going up\nSo you mean it it it's it discourages people from looking or they get a little freaky

today as we explore and discovered the secrets to health wealth in better living and if you're a long time listener\nNow let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast melt the three formula help boost your immune system\nVitamin D is responsible for two hundred different chemicals\nThat your immune cells produce to fight off bacteria and viruses\nListen if you're someone that susceptible to having any type of called fluke I Would start right now taking one of my vitamin D three miles every day and one of the nice things about this is that the size of your immune system being fat or\nYou'll find your energy better you'll find less pain less arthritic type pain more mobility flexibility better muscle strength and if you're someone who is concerned about falling it'll have better balance and a better sense of walking which is so important is that\nSo and and how do you take a doctor because\nYou can take it in the morning you could take it at night you don't need water and you're putting your mouth and you know maybe ... to thirtieth gone\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might see three I was actually traveling and I ran out of it\nSo what happened to me that you know I'm basically pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand I Know what is this\nThis is weird but then I realized that I'd run out of ... and I went off of it for several weeks and I'm the minute I started going on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know something's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best tests that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence Hugo I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do if you're at the next time you give up the number to have people orders is go had an order it I Know you mentioned it's a risk free offer and go ahead and try it yourself and stay on\nIt for five six weeks and then if you're still doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... says vitamin D three formula there's this special toll free number for you to call it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nAnd then we've been talking about Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a staff dissolving melt that's available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results and by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and keep in mind folks Dr ... says arranged a very special offers only available to you listeners so when you do call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of Dr ... vitamin D three\nAgain this is only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one of eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you call right now you qualify for an extra free supply with your order to keep yourself or share it with a family member or friend\nBut you must call now because the special radio off or is not available in stores or on line so the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three\nAnd keep in mind you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back\nAnd when you do call and order you'll not be enrolled in any of those monthly subscription programs as as a one time order folks so the number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's\nOne eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprised me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phones we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nThe study started coming out and now there's over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on Monday or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kinda pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shifts in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing\nSkin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers inside and I went home [laughter] so it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor us it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt and your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat sets this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain fibromyalgia\nI Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it into your body\nOf course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like family and a little bit younger trust\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamin D three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is a fast\nDissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results in by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body you're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains\nAnd again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offered that's only available to your listeners today so when you do call please be sure to mention this program and you're going to get a risk free trial\nOf Dr ... says vitamin D three again this is only available to your listeners\nAnd only if you called this toll free number it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you call right now you also qualify to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend\nBut you must call right now because of the special radio offer is not available in stores or on line so that number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nIf you're paying your ... get all the facts visit depth to know your\nJosh dot com

globe you just got to make sure you're targeted the mountain standard type and you might have to get up at one of the morning\nBut we'd love doing the senior show or one of the oldest and longest running shows in the U.S for seniors and we always have a fun show for you and this weekend is no different and we're going to be talking with some great friends from ... brandy Johnson and also Sean modest\nAnd we're going to take a look at a at some of the some of the programs that they offer at ... welcome nice to have your brandy and Sean thank you thank you will come\nWell thanks for taking the time to to ah to come along you know I'm One of the things that are um I don't know too much about and I've seen Humanae I just really excited about learning more about what he meant it does\nAnd I know that you're both based out of Colorado Springs but you serve a larger area so tell us a little bit of humanity and that how how you function ah in this in this area\nAll right so Humanae is a complete Medicare company we also um [noise] are so Brandi and I are both full service eight years so we cover all products\nSo that's where we come in and we actually live here in public Colorado and we branch out so we were technically work from homes or work I Hope\nThey're okay with the home office to get up in the springs to cover that larger that larger peace\nCorrect yeah so you man has been in business for over fifty years ah they started out in the nursing home business they kind of branched out purchased hospitals kinda got through that side of it and started working into the Medicare realm\nOr that allowed them to start out getting Medicare Advantage Medicare supplements prescription drug plans and then they brought us agents in where we actually do the whole spectrum you know life health annuities everything\nYeah I didn't I didn't know how large this spectrum really was so brainy what ah so ... what kinds of products are you do you handle specifically amount or do you kind of handle everything\nWell we we handle everything actually and we are full service insurance agents with Hannah that's what we call ourselves and on our business cards and you'll see it and it says um service agent or sales agent we're not here just to tell people things were actually here to\nEducate people on health and wellness you man is a health and wellness company a lot of people don't realize that either so we offer a lot of different programs that are not just Medicare and not just dental and vision not just life insurance but we also try to educate our community as well [noise] well\nThat's that's really important part of the show it's really educating our listeners to what's out there but one of the things that that I think when I look at this topic is is that\nWe don't plant enough um if you're a senior in your aging or your son or daughter oftentimes we don't react like we should until there's an issue and then you wonder well I should have known about that or I should have done that earlier\nAnd so is that something that you both run into a lot when you're talking to families about uh any one of these issues is is it really bringing people up to speed and letting them know that now's the time to do this um how does it work for you\nSure um we have we had a lot of confusion especially when we say the N word Medicare yeah of course and a lot of people aren't sure what to do so that's what we're here for in the community to educate and and start planning for if you're sixty\nYou you need to think about when you're turning sixty five you needed to start thinking about those things now what's going to be available for you and what are your options going to be\nYeah you want to make sure if you're a veteran you have if you're a veteran benefits or you want to make sure how that last or I guess you could say the last quarter of your life is going to play out\nUm unfortunately we do run into where we're doing\nA life meeting and nobody's looked at their life insurance plan for Twenty years ago I got one no big deal well who's your beneficiaries poll loophole the plans outlook at him\nUnfortunately make sure they're not to know accidental plans because we run into it all the time was an accidental insurance plan accidental\nYou know I don't I never made it gave me ... years ago and I want to have it\nYeah it's an accidental death so that we're OK yeah sorry they they actually have two accidental death policies where they don't pay out unless you die from an accidental death right where you know they're thinking they had life insurance and as soon as you know mom or dad passed where we're going to be able to help pay for this funeral or what ever happened\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't so we always do a review and we make sure we tell everybody pull it out at least every five years make sure you're beneficiaries are where you are\nMake sure nobody has any cognitive issues where they can't make any decisions anymore we need to change those beneficiaries we'd do all that and then well so do the Medicare review to where we okay do you have your everything's set where you need to get your Medicare\nWow so random when you go in a unit appointment\nUm do you have you have so many umbrellas here we're talking about I mean this is there's a lot of different facets that humanity does do you usually get called in to a meeting on one specific basket or when you called in by a family to sort of do a a big review of their entire situation\nNormally it it well it depends on the situation of course but um a lot of people will call essence they we have no idea what's next we don't know what to do this just happened or that just happened to her hand turning sixty five and two months and I don't know what the heck I'm doing so at\nThat point Medicare appointments or Medicare appointments were not allowed to actually talk about other policies like life insurance during those appointments\nSo that's why we're here is to not just gets you set up on on one type of insurance but we also follow up with you and we become your agent basically to help guide you through the life insurance policies and help guide you through ... dental and vision even\nAnd and and I can and I can sense that there's when you're negotiate this sort of labyrinth\nOf of information that sometimes we get compressed I mean I'm sixty one I'm all of a sudden for the first of all my life thinking you know what not only do I get a Happy Meal certain restaurants but I'm going to be up for a Social Security itself I got to think about that\nAnd then I got to think about this Medicare thing and how does that all tie in to me and it's a little overwhelming and I think\nUm I sort of look at you when you're in your chapter of your sixties maybe you should be looking at in the chapter of your fifties and maybe I'm a little late and so this is another reason this is a good show for me just because I Want to know what's out there would I should be\nAnd ... and it's nice to know that you have boundaries too you know you go in and although hey look here we are you slap Eighteen thousand pamphlets of the day and age we're here to serve you you know and I think it's a good way to go is to is to really kind of take people down he let's review where you are let's take a look at how you're feeling about\nYour process your aging some of us expect a ... short a timeline of life some people are going to be on an escalator for a long long long time and so that really does change things up or is that ... is that how you approach this\nYeah when when we go in you know we may have a Medicare planet so we go in\nWe do a full we do a full review saying okay what what makes you not sleep at night you know are you worried about things are you worried about this and that's where we'll condense down to products and say okay these are the three that will helps sleep\nYeah help you sleep better do most of your business come from friends and family members who refer people because they know that they need some help\nOr do you or or is it when you're out in the community you just you just kind of happened to run into people's this'll referrals sort of thing where people in Pueblo should be telling their friends about a program like this and for sure and having people pursue it\nAbsolutely and it's kind of funny because our friends and family are actually the ones that are the hardest for us to talk [laughter]\nSo they're great at referring people to say hey brandy and Sean can help you out but they don't really listen to us very well our friends and family don't but we also work with the VSW with low income housing units we work with\nAll of the doctors in town and in southern Colorado we are in our doctors' offices and talking to our our physicians and and their staff saying hey this is what we can do and\nThat's kind of how we get our referrals and people come in and say hey I heard you that you didn't just do Medicare you also do life insurance or you also do hospital plans or even short term home health care\nWhat I Want to term care insurance do you guys stay away from that product or do you embrace that\nLong term care is pretty pretty cumbersome and is pretty expensive after a certain age\nOr so there's a lot of avenues to kind of stare around instill implement or in bed the long term care or you can do that with the ... and you can embed like a long term care writer so you're not losing your money is still run you know if you were to go to long term care then it's going to turn\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more of this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming and then we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurances are what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah because you're going to see things coming that we don't see that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is showing how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think his affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're gone\nNow and I bet you if we made a phone call they'd probably say how much is

show the show about seniors for seniors and those of us that loved them I'm Dave ... here at news talk five Ninety Casey us Jay and uh we enjoy doing the show with you I'm here in the studio with Randy Johnson\nAnd also Sean modest from Humanae and it's great to have you both on board and we talk a little bit here about short term healthcare insurance but before we do I want to thank our sponsors of the show\nVisiting angels a problem for us sponsoring the show as well as Montgomery in Stuart funeral directors great companies\nAnd a few need those services we'd sure encourage you to to use them\nAnd when we're talking about the short term home health care insurance is up you know that's a subject that we don't really uh we\nDon't know when it's when we're going to need it it sort of catches you off guard but I think it's really a great discussion uh to to to have in terms of what's available out there and what should we be thinking about and maybe many of us are unaware that this even exists so give us a little over a view on what this is\nWell most Americans like to recuperate in their own home or from hospital stay or in a nursing facility stay and so Humanae\nHas actually partnered up with ... which is guaranteed trust it's a great company has been around for ... years and we are offering this new short term home healthcare insurance to cover you while you're at home to cover\nA home health care home health care aide even with benefits for prescription costs as well as hospitals say I'm coverage\nSo ... so it's so it's a wide wide birth of a lot of items that are put into a policy like this um it's probably ... is this something new or that that you're that you're offering has this been out there for a long time\nNo this is actually new within the last couple of months that's new to new within our portfolio I guess you want to say ah there's probably a few other companies out there but knew the Humanae we've been doing this for a month you know after training and going over but over a month and people are actually liking that\nYou know hey I get paid back for prescriptions that I'm taking\nA which most of us take at least one or so\nAnd then it's also going to cover it depends on what you look at and how much you want and you kinda can build your own kind of like a big you know happy ... my way like the I Want this or that so you can put in the hospital stay it comes with the basic short term healthcare but you can add pieces to it to help cover your gaps in your insurance coverage\nOkay good so it's very customized double it sounds like and that's kind of what is that where a lot of products are going in the future to to give people better choices and and there seem it seems to be complicated so this kind of fills those holes right\nRight it does it does cover the gaps in care\nBut it also like Shawn said a lot of us are taking medication this policy is actually for any one forty years old and older not just the sixty five Medicare people so uh this this covers some co pays for you and and a lot of us that take medication every day we're all paying a co pay almost every month\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think you know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met his no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have\nI Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable could you can you what have you explain that to where we position is\nIn our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure that the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage\nAnd I think brand you can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more on that side\nYeah in ... with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lot of people\nOn that we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kind of scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nAh we kind of think about it as a child doesn't really well it's a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know and this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man a brand new Johnson and Sean modest and uh and uh what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at\nI'm actually on our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number is seven one nine to three eight six three five five and Sean's is seven one nine to three seven four or five one night\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more of this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming I mean we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nMilitary my family as part of what are my family for a long time I want to go on to make a difference I didn't find that working behind a desk so for me and then they offered in my community for my country was just like them\nTo learn how to be part

comes down to is this vitamin D deficiency that's out there is causing an avalanche of health problems for Seventy percent of our population ranging from\nPain loss of balance muscle weakness depression increase blood pressure arthritis memory loss and even a compromised immune system and I have Dr Michael Pincus with me today to talk about the most effective way to get vitamin D Dr ...

sugar immune system blood pressure fallen string\nPlus ... has been linked to maintaining call and health brass across an ovarian health but I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all

which is totally worthless or God Forbid if you're listening right now and you're taking a multi vitamin and you think you're covered fats\nWhy you're on six or eight or ten different prescription drugs I'll tell you that white now ...\nBecause your body is not getting enough the the other thing is that vitamin D is an oil you don't absorb oils and your body they're very difficult to digest okay I've come up with my own vitamin D which I call Dr focus the vitamin D three formula\nSo Dr bank is what makes your fast smelled vitamin D formula so unique\nWell Chris first of all I put five

of scientists and these guys they know their stuff and they're using this technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder and once they do that they put it in this vast dissolving melt for immediate absorption and quick results that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr bank is from people that are taking your\nFast melt the three\nOh I'm getting tons

us in this country are deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd the statistics show that back in the
