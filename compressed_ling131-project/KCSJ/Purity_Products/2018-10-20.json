back to around the house with Ken moon want five Ninety case yes as a furnace question brand is good morning run the air Hi\nYeah I live in a trial level I've got me from then on the upper level hallway and I got one up near the ceiling and one near the floor and like I can as the time of year what season it is\nLike walking the air on one of those return air vents off you know depending on the the the weather\nSo you have I just want to read state this and get it in my head here you have a floor level return it directly above it you have a mother colder return on the upper part of the wall\nI yeah exactly\nYeah I I Would probably leave them alone the more Airflow the better actually through that for him as a viewers I think they did that to facilitate air conditioning because we want to suck more air you know through the system or in the summertime you Americans the central air Brandon\nYes I Do yeah so I think you have a a good system for central or I Would just leave them alone we just want to maximize the Airflow or through the furnace yeah you're fine okay I appreciate it\nYou got it yeah we don't want to block off return or a grills because it just limits that air flow across the heat exchange was Bryan was talking about and across the air conditioning coils in the summertime we do like to strategically locate return airs especially in the upper level main levels not as important as the basement many folks have a heat\nDucks are ... others of the fence you can open and close on the ceiling in the basement that's the most convenient place to put them and if that's the case then you are that you have a issue a with getting the heat\nDown at Flora level where you actually sit and watch TV and so on and so we need to return on the floor for sure in a basement so that he comes out of the ceiling goes down and across\nAre you in the furniture and everything in into the cold air return on the floor level or in the upper and a levels we have the heat fence on the floor\nAnd so we have returned to err err on the floor which is fine but in Brandon's case there's a ... there's some return or a high up in the wall which again results in that cross circulation\nSo that's the best that you have the best of both worlds brand and I would not block any of those off 'cause you're sure want to maximize the Airflow summer\nAnd fall and winter sometimes it's just a matter of circulation\nYou know it's a hot summer day you come home from work turn that furnished fan on to run all evening long and that'll circulate the warm air out of the upper level and suck up through the furnace to be mixed up with a cooler on the lower level\nAnd that way the temperature is moderate all throughout the house especially on a trial level or two story where it's hard to mix those air masses up anyway if you turn the furnace fan on\nIt all gets mixed together and shoved back through the furnace to be cool on a hot summer day so turning that for a new spin on\nA is a big benefit in the summertime when you come home safe four or five o'clock we've been on all evening\nLong be comfortable on hot summer for Michael thanks for your expertise and

zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three [noise]\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and occupying is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it's surprise me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phones we get enough being outside and in our milk and\nEnd of story right and for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D or from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kinda pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers inside and I went home I though it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone string ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility\nThat you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat sets this set in and that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain\nFibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nSo of course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take it is what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Chris\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results are basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamin D three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast\nDissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results in by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body you're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains\nAnd again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offered this only available to your listeners today so when you do call please be sure to mentioned this program and

seniors and those of us all of the ... with visiting ... and I'm so glad you've taken the time to spend some time with us again on this weekend we do the show every Saturday morning at eight thirty am mountain standard time you can also hear aside I hurt radio so we love to have you joined us\nAll over the globe you just gotta make sure you're targeted the mountain standard type and you might have to get up at one of the morning\nBut we'd love doing the senior show or one of the oldest and longest running shows in the U.S for seniors and we always have a fun show for you and this weekend is no different and we're going to be talking with some great friends from Humanae brandy Johnson and also Sean modest\nAnd we're going to take a look at a at some of the some of the programs that they offer at ... welcome nice to have your brandy and Sean thank you thank you will come\nWell thanks for taking the time to to uh to come along you know I'm One of the things that are um I don't know too much about and I've seen Humanae I just really excited about learning more about what he meant it does\nAnd I know that you're both based out of Colorado Springs but you serve a larger area so tell us a little bit of humanity that how how you function the in this in this area\nAll right so Humanae is a complete Medicare company we also um [noise] are so Brandi and I are both full service eight years so we cover all products\nSo that's where we come in and we actually live here in ... Colorado and we branch out so we were technically work from home or work\nAt home to okay with the home office get up in the springs to cover that larger that larger peace\nCorrect yeah so you man has been in business for over fifty years ah they started out in the\nNursing home business they kinda branched out purchased hospitals kinda got through that side of it and started working into the Medicare realm\nOr that allowed them to start out getting Medicare Advantage Medicare supplements prescription drug plans and then they brought us agents and where we actually do the whole spectrum you know life health and duties everything\nYeah I didn't I didn't know how large this spectrum really was so brainy what uh so what kinds of products are you do you handle specifically amount or do you kind of handle everything\nWell we we handle everything actually and we are full service insurance agents with Humanae that's what we call ourselves and on our business card and then you'll see it and it says\nUm service agent or sales agent we're not here just to sell people things were actually here to\nEducate people on health and wellness you man is a health and wellness company a lot of people don't realize that either so we offer a lot of different programs that are not just Medicare and not just dental and vision not just life insurance but we also try to educate our community as well\n[noise] well that's that's really important part of the show it's really educating our listeners\nTo what's out there but one of the things that that I think when I look at this topic is is that\nWe don't plant enough um if you're a senior in your aging or your son or daughter oftentimes we don't react like we should until there's an issue and then you wonder well I should have known about that or I should have done that earlier\nAnd so is that something that you both run into a lot when you're talking to families about uh any one of these issues is is it really bringing people up to speed and letting them know that now's the time to do this um how does it work for you\nSure um we have we had a lot of confusion especially when we say the N word Medicare yeah of course and a lot of people aren't sure what to do so that's what we're here for in the community to educate and and start planning for if you're sixty\nYou you need to think about when you're turning sixty five you needed to start thinking about those things now what's going to be available for you and what are your options going to be\nYeah you want to make sure if you're a veteran you have if you're a veteran benefits or you want to make sure how that last or I guess you could say the last quarter of your life is going to play out\nUm unfortunately we do run into where we're doing\nA life meeting and nobody's looked at their life insurance plan for Twenty years ago I got one no big deal well who's your beneficiaries poll loophole the plans outlook at him\nUnfortunately make sure they're not to know accidental plans because we run into it all the time was an accidental insurance plan accidental\nYou know I don't I never made it gave me this years ago and I want to have it\nYeah it's an accidental death so that we're OK yeah sorry they they actually have two accidental death policies where they don't pay out unless you die from an accidental death right where you know they're thinking they had life insurance and as soon as you know mom or dad passed where we're going to be able to help pay for this funeral or what ever happened\nAnd unfortunately it doesn't so we always do a review and we make sure we tell everybody pull it out at least every five years make sure you're beneficiaries are where you are make sure nobody has any cognitive issues where they can't make any decisions anymore we\nNeed to change those beneficiaries we'd do all that and then well so do the Medicare review to where we okay do you have your everything's set where you need to get your Medicare\nWow so random when you go in a unit appointment um do you have you have so many umbrellas here we're talking about I mean this is there's a lot of different facets that\nHumanity does do you usually get called in to a meeting on one specific bastard or when you're called in by a family to sort of do I'm a big review of their entire situation\nNormally it it well it depends on the situation of course but um a lot of people will call essence they we have no idea what next we don't know what to do this just happened or that just happened to her hand turning sixty five and two months and I don't know what the heck I'm doing so at\nThat point Medicare appointments or Medicare appointments were not allowed to actually talk about other policies like life insurance during those appointments\nSo that's why we're here it's too not just gets you set up on on one type of insurance but we also follow up with you and we become your agent basically to help guide you through the life insurance policies and help guide you through ... dental and vision even\nYeah and and and I can and I can sense that there's when you negotiate this sort of labyrinth\nOf of information that sometimes we get compressed I mean I'm sixty one I'm all of a sudden for the first of all my life thinking you know what not only do I get a Happy Meal certain restaurants but I'm going to be up for a Social Security itself I got to think about that\nAnd then I got to think about this Medicare thing and how does that all tie and to me and it's a little overwhelming and I think\nUm I sort of look at you when you're in your chapter of your sixties maybe you should be looking that in the chapter of your fifties and maybe I'm a little late and so this is another reason this is a good show for me just because I Want to know what's out there what I should be considering and it's nice to know that you have boundaries too you know you go in and although\nLook here we are you slap Eighteen thousand pamphlets on the ice age we're here to serve you you know and I think it's a good way to go is to is it really kind of take people down he let's review where you are let's take a look at how you're feeling about\nYour process your aging some of us expect a ... a short a timeline of life some people are going to be on an escalator for a long long long time and so that really does change things up or is that ... is that how you approach this\nYeah when when we go in you know we may have a Medicare climate so we go in\nWe do a full we do a full review saying okay what what makes you not sleep at night you know are you worried about things are you worried about this and that's where we'll condense down to products and say okay these are the three that will helps sleep yeah help you sleep\nBetter do most of your business come from friends and family members who refer people because they know that they need some help\nOr do you or or is it when you're out in the community you just you just kind of happened to run into people's this'll referrals sort of thing where people in Pueblo should be telling their friends about a program like this and for sure and uh having people pursue it\nAbsolutely and it's kind of funny because our friends and family are actually the ones that are the hardest for us to talk [laughter]\nSo they are great at referring people to say hey brandy and Sean can help you out but they don't really listen to us very well our friends and family don't but we also work with the VSW with low income housing units we work with\nAll of the doctors in town and in southern Colorado we are in our doctors' offices and talking to our our physicians and and their staff saying hey this is what we can do and\nThat's kind of how we get our referrals and people come in and say hey I heard you that you didn't just do Medicare you also do life insurance or you also do hospital plans or even short term home health care what\nI Want to term care insurance do you guys stay away from that product or do you embrace that\nLong term care is pretty pretty cumbersome and is pretty expensive after a certain age or so there's a lot of avenues to kind of stare around instill implement or in bed the long term care\nOr you can do that with the ... and you can embed like a long term care writer so you're not losing your money is still run you know if you were to go to long term care then it's going to\nTurn on well that's the there's a lot of care that I've seen is there's no brake pedal on it you know I don't get it when you're fifty and it's like you could see increases that could literally drive you out of the marketplace yeah so I Know that there are some other instruments and not the not that we want to spend the show talking about those but\nCertainly life insurance annuities um and one of the things that I think people right now are confused about is look how do we handle the the the rising costs and your experts in that and so that's another reason for\nThe defense team yeah yeah because you're going to see things coming that we don't see and I are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is showing how 'bout you what if what if some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're going\nNo ... I bet you if we made a phone call they probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retired and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go that's where you could say brandy and I are your age are person 'cause we can help direct even I I'm a big believer even if you didn't picky man at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy James ... so I think this is a great discussion and ah they were going to ... uh come back and just a few moments in a kind of close out the show and we'll give you the overview to Humanae now you're listening to the senior living today show we'll be right back after these are ... so don't go away\nSometimes in our lives we need a little help\nWhether it's you or a loved one consider visiting angels to provide the personal care you deserve visiting angels has been serving southern Colorado since two thousand and has been selected a nationwide home care leadership and excellence award for twenty fourteen and\nTwenty Fifteen from one to twenty four hours a day visiting angels provide your loved ones with experience caregivers to provide the love and companionship to keep you in the place that you love the vest with hygiene transportation meals and like housework\nAnd you'll appreciate the longstanding better Business Bureau rating of a plus\nSo when it's time for you to get a little help call visiting angels at five four\nThree forty two twenty five four three four two two zero or go to visiting angels dot com for more information\nNow laughing services like ... or ... or other actors provide bouncing around ... tried to match their prices but it's a\nQuality behind ... professional uh personalized service important for when victims are their loved ones there really is no match for now ... trained to Montgomery and they were had remained a rare that compound ownership on operation means a lot but it's not for being located in our\nCommunity the town actor then [noise] go to Montgomery there were a dot com ...\nAnd now back to the senior living today show with your host David Early on news dot five Ninety Casey as J.\nA. thanks for joining us today on the senior living today show we're coming down the home stretch\nThis is day return on your host and I'm a news talk five Ninety Casey us Jay every Saturday morning at eight thirty\nAnd usually on Sunday is it ten so I'd love to have you join us a\nRight here in southern Colorado or around the world on my heart radio dot com just go to ... find Casey as Jay and you can hear us for ever you may be that we're talking with Randy Johnson is Sean modest from Humanae and we're talking about some of the programs they offer as we\nAs we kind of wrap up the show one of the things we wanted to talk about was veterans and there's a lot of veterans in this area how can you impact them\nSo we always kind of try to meet our first question on both of our laptops are you a veteran\nEveryone goes why why do you ask well because there's other benefits that may be available to you that you may not know about um plus Randy just did a stand down where we did the homeless veterans gave him haircuts clothing\nUm counseling services there was one in there for you know how to buy a house or so um so there's multiple as to what we can help do for veterans I had a veteran call or a veterans son call me asking about you know hey my my father just passed away what do I need to do to get his service taking care of\nColumbia so this is where we need to go there you go and so we we help on that and and we have the\nConnection is eight and attendance programs I mean there really are a lot of veterans services available many of us who are veterans didn't even really know about correct until just in the last few years there's been a lot of uh shined a light on that so look if you have a loved one that's a veteran or you don't give these folks to call I think this would be that should be a a great way to go\nI'm so Randy Johnson is showing motto let's give out your information so that people could get a hold of you and you maybe help a guide them a little bit\nCake so Sean modest I cover public Kenyan\nAll the way through ... up and down and most of that that's my pretty much my main territory or footprint are the best phone number to reach me seven one nine to three seven four or five one nine or just to do a consultation see if there's anything else that you may be missing have no no fees no requirements and\n...

dot five Ninety Casey as Joe they were\nBack in the senior living today show the show about seniors for seniors and those of us that loved them I'm Dave ... here at news talk five Ninety Casey us Jay and uh we enjoy doing the show with you I'm here in the studio with Randy Johnson\nAnd also showing modest from humanity and it's great to have you both on board and we have to talk a little bit here about short term healthcare insurance but before we do I want to thank our sponsors of the show\nVisiting angels a problem for us sponsoring the show as well as Montgomery and Stewart funeral directors great companies and a few need those services we'd sure encourage you to to use them\nAnd when we're talking about a short term home healthcare insurance is up you know that's a subject that we don't really uh we\nDon't want us when we're going to need it it sort of catches you off guard but I think it's really a great discussion uh to to to have in terms of what's available out there and what should we be thinking about and maybe many of us are unaware that this even exists so give us a little over a view on what this is\nWell most Americans like to recuperate in their own home or from hospital stay or in a nursing facility stay and so Humanae\nHas actually partnered up with ... which is guaranteed trust it's a great company it's been around for ... years and we are offering this new short term home healthcare insurance to cover you while you're at home to cover\nA home health care home health care aide even with benefits for prescription costs as well as hospitals stay um coverage\nSo ... so it's so it's a wide wide birth of a lot of items that are put into a policy like this um it's probably ... is this something new or that that you're that you're offering has this been out there for a long time\nNo this is actually new within the last couple of months that's new to new within our portfolio I guess you want to say ah there's probably a few other companies out there but knew the Humanae we've been doing this for a month you know after training and going over but over a month and people are actually liking that\nYou know hey I get paid back for prescriptions that I'm taking\nA which most of us take at least one or so\nAnd then it's also going to cover it depends on what you look at and how much you want and you kinda can build your own kind of like a big you know happy ... my way like to I Want this or that so you can put in the hospital stay it comes with the basic short term healthcare but you can add pieces to it to help cover your gaps in your insurance coverage\nOkay good so it's very customized double it sounds like and that's kind of what is that where a lot of products are going in the future to to give people better choices and and there seem it seems to be complicated so this kind of fills those holes right\nRight it does it does cover those gaps in care\nBut it also like Shawn said a lot of us are taking medication this policy is actually for any one forty years old and older not just the sixty five Medicare people so uh this this covers some co pays for you and and a lot of us that take medication every day we're all paying a co pay almost every month\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a ... there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think you know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met his no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have\nI Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable could you can you what have you explain that to where we position is in our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you know does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option which may be Medicare Advantage\nAnd I think brand you can cover Medicare Advantage is a little bit more on that side\nYeah in with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lot of people\nAnd we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nAh we kind of think about it as a child doesn't really well it's a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve you know and this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you um we're talking with you man a brand new Johnson and Sean modest and uh\nAnd what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to do to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at I'm actually\nOn our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number is seven one nine to three eight six three five five and Sean's is seven one nine to three seven four or five one night\nOkay and and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more of this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face with families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming next I mean we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nTime nice to have your long today I Want to start by sending a big thank you out to our sponsor Dr Newton's naturals they're one of the
