{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "What other brand name says the coat a minister easily found it's it's kind of a niche product because until recently not a lot of stucco was out there but the difference because it doesn't have an organic components to it and let this\nOrganics get broken down by satellite so that's the problem with conventional paid and why is that the organic become or go to the sun and and you know get a degraded over time\nThis is all of silica basis all mineral based gel a ... gun through changes for thousands of years so um the the minerals don't the grade and the color that it could end it's not an organic solar\nShow it actually will stand up and they're just as I understand I've never used it\nBut my research indicates that ends up on the other side a lot longer I don't agree fifty years in Colorado maybe a bit of a stretch\nI sounds expensive but\nIt is more expensive but if you don't have to pay for quite a few years and it stands up their color or it might be worth it\nSure sure you know it was this guy and this email was asking about should we put a color in the ... or or not and and places like a Phoenix where they stucco virtually all the houses\nI'm a ... they they just great code the house and then when you come along and buy it they'll they'll paint it for you and I'm not sure what kind of paint they used to have to be honest with you but that's more common down there a is to paint stucco after it's been a a ban applies so you get to pick your pick your own color\nHum I appreciate the feedback on that it does sound expensive but I can I get the idea that the that the minerals would kind of bond with the underlying ... materials in kind of a ... they would all just kind of bond together versus lying on top makes sense doesn't it\nYeah it actually gets there was or by the by the concrete or the ... yeah so yeah it becomes part of the structure rather than just laying low income\nSleeves given me a

tissues and use a screw right through the carpet if you would like the most effective way though is to is to have if there's five or six places uh then I think it's good to have a carpet laying company or carpet installation company\nCome in and roll the carpet back and just start using decks screws either going to cost you a labor for the carpet a folks but if you want to foolproof way to do this but they're not going to return you get some three and a half inch deck screws and just walk these uh creeks down each floor Joyce\nUntil they quit so uh that's what I Would do you probably gonna have to have a guy's carpet guy standing there watching you do this\nBut it'll be a once and for all kind of thing uh but also if you'd like to check out the breakaway screw those\nShips they

summer project kind of rapid those up for the season hope you can join this this weekend is we take your calls about your home\nAnd home with Gary Sullivan Sunday mornings at seven a new stock five Ninety KCBS Jay\nFive K. C. S. J.\n... dot com and on your own with our high hard radiolab\nHello and welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that's stressed and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nParkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with now what happens is that you need a magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and the cats sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case study of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas that like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nMagnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they do\nTheir foot ... and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more rest or whatever right and that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting goal in life you start getting a muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researcher it how do you get this\nEnd of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because get that a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this\nPowder and mix it in yeah and you drink that's cut down this great ... is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood strip\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three not kill max is a unique blend up calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd want to let you know the doctor biggest has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this is only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number it's one eight hundred nine seven one\nTo nine nine three\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep a low energy pain and stiffness and your muscles and joins your body is telling you is lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to prove your heart health your digestive health\nAnd human reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you try to kill max formula only have to do is pick up the phone and call one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three\nAnd when you do call today you're also going to get that free book it's called the user's guide to calcium and magnesium and folks in this book is packed with vital information about why your calcium needs change with age Cal seems rolling cardiovascular health osteoporosis diabetes depression fatigue it's all in this very informative book\nAnd I forget it I'm going to give away after my comment for your call partner for your listeners to pick up the phone and it can manage to that\nWill thank you for doing that Dr Pincus I really appreciate it folks and this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three and remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael make us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their\nBody well that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little trips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] not your bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take the comments formula many times they will calm your back paid well I Know I I a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula and I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour\nI was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period yet at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah\nAnd if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this\nCow next formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond\nTo this and I recently gave a candidate\nTo a lady who was suffering from five of my object where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming\nAnd I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula and um she said she got a really good we go sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer may take it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use is what the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and and that add to that in the medication so\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium ... them in the system while the other very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body and experience and because of the fishing and ... and many of them is also blocking further absorption\nSomething so it's really it's really a rat race I think it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah you have nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred nine seven one to nine nine three now ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can

you again and uh we're going to be talking today on the show about lifeline and a ... rising people with what lifeline is and and really what an impact it's been for all of southern Colorado\nBut before we do that we have an annual event that you're sort of a really want to talk about today and what would that be\nThat event coming up is the eleventh annual safety of seniors conference sponsored by thirty a and their circle of friends and it's a great event we typically have about two hundred and thirty seniors participating in this event every year and it's coming up on September Eighteenth\nRegistration is going to start at eight thirty and we just had a sign that gay full as learning about and just safety information for seniors and a wide variety of information is going to be provided and a lot of time for people to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd we have about thirty vendors there that are going to provide a wide variety of information and so we would love to has as many people there as possible and we want to provide some great an education on safety\nFor great I remember when it was the first one ... I don't remember the first one\nAnd it was very unique because it was a smaller gathering but it was really about really are influencing seniors to come and to learn about safety and that's just kind of state that's kind of where this has been and a what a great event it's been through the years and it's nice to see a growing and people actively involved\nAnd it's a hoot just a lot of people there and so our goal today is to let you also know about it so those of you that are listening will want to come\nYes um [noise] I have some information on some of the speakers are going to have and this is typical for most years we will have the police department there\nUm which will be our first and our lungs talk and question and answer period we have chief Kevin ... coming and he will be in the program and out a little bit after nine o'clock and just go over some updating of safety um information and crime information in\nPueblo and then provide some time for anybody to ask any questions that they might have\nAnd then we also will have officer brand in both they they're um just to answer questions that anybody might have so that'll be a great way for people to start a conversation about anything they might be worried about and then um we have some other programs later on in the day that will get some specific safety\nAnd we have we live in a great community I'm at a lot of great support here\nAnd I think one of the one of the things that we often you know people get so comfortable in their in their life they get comfortable in their day to day and seniors you can just sort of lay down their guard a little bit\nAnd there are people out there that really want to take advantage of that I've done a number of radio shows are with our local law enforcement about fraud and\nThe and some of the types of things that that that are going on phone calls to our seniors and trying to build them out of thing and I and I and I I'm not trying to scare anyone but I think this was a great place to come just to Research Center\nUm how you live your life what you're doing just to make sure that the ... if you're living independently ... where you are that you stay very cautious\nTo your surroundings and and uh it it ... it always helps to have more education about what's happening in the local community so people are really come how much does it cost to go\nIt's free cell yeah it's free it's free and you get lunch and great entertainment as well so what a\nDeal so that's a the data this is going to be September Eighteenth yet and that's a that's a Tuesday

going all the way to Durango\nAnd and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of extra credit you learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are and whether you're in assisted living where they're going to independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids I

R. I. heart radio dot com\nAnd uh this is really the show about seniors and we talk about seniors were in our relates to southern Colorado but many of you are in other countries\nListening but our heart radio dot com and and you know what senior issues are senior issues all over the world I deal with seniors in Mexico Canada the u._k. South Korea and you know what the same story exists\nWith all of those marketplaces so I'm On the show here today with Andrea ... burger we're talking about is already a lifeline\nAnd the importance of of this particular service that's out there or southern Colorado\nWhich has been out there for a long time and how it really affects our senior so I ... thanks for for coming on and sharing this with uh our listeners we we kind of need everybody to be thinking about what's going on with mom or dad if something happens when no one's around\nDefinitely and and that's just that's a common issue that people don't think about these types of things that can really help seniors um stay independent and tell\nThey're in desperate need something to help because an incident happened and and so now that they finally realized that mom or dad needs help then they're seeking these services out we want to make sure people are aware of the services before anything serious were to happen on our mom and dad is injured\nAnd and so that's why we have lifeline and me\nPromote it to the community and that's why I Would I Do because on that the thing that everybody wants to be as independent as possible matter what your ages and I'm\nWith the ... when you grow in Asia you you can have some issues that might lead to falls\nUm and the major thing with the fall is that you might not be able to get up and the longer that you lay there after a fall and the way she could be injured\nAnd you know I think the scary part is is that those of us in senior care\nThat we see that it sneaks up on people oh mom is fine dads are driving around and nobody's even thinking about this until there's a fall off the porch fall down the stairs something happens and that fall is catastrophic and changes everything mhm and so you know false are going to happen but\nI'm a real advocate of the lifeline program because look around the neck it's it's it's it's something that\nYou have and if you fall you're not going to be wondering uh in six hours from now who's coming to visit me you you know you have that immediate response and I think the sons and daughters just need to think about we may think mom and dad's doing great\nBut they may have fallen and not told you and once we get into falls you know they can they can happen in series and then one day the fall is really the number one cause of why people die so that this is such an important topic and and this was a pretty affordable system isn't it ...\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um possible possible hospitalizations I'm from a fall and especially laying there for a long time and it's definitely something that you can be proactive with an an affordable product and that can help keep families face and keep ... parents at home longer and independent\nAnd help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know that if they were to have a fall that and that it's just that push the button and they can get help\nAnd actually we do have a son and units that have father catching him so with that technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be able to push a button and it's very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help\nAnd even if a button isn't pushed so and that's just said\nThat's really great for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there no one's around that they do fall for under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independents that they're really seeking and then after that of course you've got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but what a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it small\nAnd it's not bad and and the one with the fall detection has to be one around that then neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more in on the arrest and those are mostly for people that are more and just an ad in the home and buy themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them\nAnd but with the ones around the Napoli has some that actually are on mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all detection and on and and if they were his fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood\nAnd it would detect that fall or they can push a button and and it has GPS locating in it so that and help with the able to find them where they are\nOkay so somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do I get it set up how hard is it to get it set up a mountain so\nIt's it's very easy and again you can just call the same number that you call for that the senior conference that's I mean my my number it's five for five when she went to kill and\nAnd just give us your name information and we will just figure out what kind of and questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need 'em to get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get my my dad set up\nAnd so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nDid it plugs into the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it uses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape and that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah this is good so\nIf some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil I think I'll pass on that I'll just hollowed out for the neighbor\nYou know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this was lifeline but they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in Pueblo\nTwenty six years ago and now look at it going all the way to Durango\nAnd as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of extra credit you learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and or whether you're in assisted living whether you're in an independent living or at home or maybe you're living

[noise]\nHello and welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host press McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress\nOr even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr bank is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we called mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up in traffic and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more\nConcerned about the muscles that you don't feel that she has the muscles in the arteries oh that guy ended up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nHealth and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more\nPretty so it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and active roses and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has\nTo do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many ... it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones\nWell yeah OK yeah and it does build your ...\nBut he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if it needs it\nThat's right I think and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of about\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure district milk just drink milk or you know you'll out a green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but\nFirst of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian who they're irradiated um the calcium as leach from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food\nStore drug maker right but these things don't absorb and the body that's happening\nFor a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say at antacid that has the cows they met like Tom's first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut see what happens when you take a Tom isn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that isn't\nA powdered and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system wow\nSo that's a problem that well\nYeah because when calcium and museum or a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fast absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the magnesium being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy combat formula does absorb incredibly\nIn the body the thing is is that when you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people are ready to the doctor because I Can't believe it thirty minutes after the ... pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time an IRS mean this is really amazing\nI Want
