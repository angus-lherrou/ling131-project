transactions you know what that means\nNothing it means the government flags it and then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve\nLaw breaking but here's somebody who forty year old woman\nThought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath that you would violate the law and ruined her career and now I now probably her life along with it\nBecause it was just as that important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it splits should lead to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone who was leaking classified information or sensitive information about individuals and businesses right\nThis is stuff since then reports for our own on anybody this isn't even intelligence world stuff is there are there can be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash in the bank you know maybe a lot of banks sale\n\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information because they understand that if ... if it gets out there it can do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed by this\nSo you have to wonder how many other federal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration members there was a from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that tied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a message\nSense it very clear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump\nYou could be the subject of this kind of government activism somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high levels sensitive access could decide to release information about you too I'm not saying that will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it and it's not just\nPeople that have worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing or you to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the cost that you would encourage you'd be willing to incur in order to continue speaking yeah they are waging a form of psychological warfare with these kinds of activities\nOh just this one oh how about the guy who ... a bunch of ... a Republican members of Congress who worked in the Congress but all their private information out there that's the kind of stuff that makes Senator Rand Paul's wife sleep with a loaded gun under her bed now\nThis isn't a one off these people are doing this stuff who lead the conversation between General Flynn and the ambassador to or from Russia served ...\nWho did I haven't found that person yet I think it was a very senior Obama administration holdover I've got some gas is a horrific abuse of national security power and the destruction of individuals privacy\nThat's how they play the game they will break the law they will weaponize the government against us and then we'll turn around and say why are you so mean when we win because we have superior arguments\n'cause we're right [noise] and they can cry and they could whine about this as much as they want [noise]\nBut we're right [noise]\nDon't ever

the Saudis and the Turks and what's going on there's there's nobody that we can look out and say oh we\nCan trust their word on this one now we've got to verify but this idea that because Trump calls Jim Acosta clown which I Would note that\nOh you know Obama used a trash Fox News ... network that provided anything of a voice of opposition at all Obama used to trash Fox News on a on a\nOn a regular basis and no one said anything about it really was the one network that stood against it and\nYou know that they're saying that because Trump is critical of the press because he expresses his opinion about uh media apparatus that is entirely against it\nBecause of that I'm ...\nYears somehow complicit in the murder of his journalist journalists have been oppressed and detained and murdered in foreign countries for as long as they're journalists new but this is all the anything\nBad that happens in the world is Trump's fall to the left anything bad that happens anywhere in the world of any consequences you can say it's Trump's fault if their sexism somewhere it's comfortable it there's racism somewhere at Trump's fault if whatever may ... dictators desperate stressful\nThey get past the fact that as I said to you yesterday Obama's inaction and did the ring and cowardice as commander in chief contributed to a half a million people just chewed up in the meat grinder that was a Syrian civil war horrific violence\nAnd you know Obama was is nowhere to be seen in terms of leadership nothing if anybody made the situation worse made sure that there were arms that got into the hands of the ... I mean that's what happened\nSo we're we're going to hear from the people that are okay with that about how Trump isn't able to do this but it just so typical isn't it it's just so\nStandard operating procedure from the left and I got I\nGot to ask Dr Gorka today Sebastian Gorka was on was on rising demand got ask them and say you know hold on a second um\nWhat do you say doctor gee I'd like to um Dr G good guy when he said I can see the people that are always talking about trumpet so cozy with dictators he just says look at the actions look what he does I mean you know Trump has his way of finding gray sheet him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state\nAnd this whole standard that they set up is nonsense a standard that you know Trump path to talk or you know super aggressively to everybody and he needs to hold to Nick how this\nIs nonsense this is complete and utter nonsense\nBut this is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings with food and then Kim Jong on these others and essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy\nOr you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential we can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing the\nPresident because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage that hey Trump that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the left now is infused with this\nAnti Trump rage uh you know they are really the cause those anti father should be anti trust anti Trump She did their city while while\nI I Am so sick of all the grandstanding on this on this ... issue and I also think that people are really over selling overestimating how much of this is our fault in our problem how much of this is something that we really need to take the lead and doing\nWhat did I think we're going to do I I'm not about to say yeah let's send in the eighties second airborne you know or a hundred and first airborne whoever I let's send them in and you know and until the Saudis turned over to the crown prince you know we're just going to\nSit on their you know sit on their soil no this isn't saying we're not gonna do anything like

of people more than we can hold his enthusiasm like we had\nYou know the last election twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day in the evening I think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I keep hearing about the enthusiasm to blue wave but I think we have tremendous enthusiasm\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm\nAnd I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough he uh he is I could tell very optimistic about how is looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview uh think of that same interview that that is really got me a concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if\nIf it's cyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nOr ... or anything in this country when we say oh there's ... there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell light that none of them\nIs that that goes to the head is amazing race too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him [laughter] but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nIs going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue\nAnd I say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so and I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached the point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is\nAnd then around the country and sure enough\nI'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be\nSome rough water and that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know we have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous a series of enormous debt bubbles\nA student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans very very high uh we're more in debt it now\nThan when we were at the time of the crisis in many ways and you know deeper and deeper in debt we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fix than any of this stuff structurally now be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I I'm not\nI cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there these far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does that all the rhetoric but they liked that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as\nA opposite oppositional and willing to take action about all of\nThis and with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nReset right if the debt turns into a crisis gave all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and
