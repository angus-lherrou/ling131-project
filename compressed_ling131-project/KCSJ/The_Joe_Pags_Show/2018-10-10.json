have responded now that we've finally\nAchieved justice and yes it is justice or judge Kavanaugh to now be on the Supreme Court oh we\nRecognize that there are other things to join our focus do we recognize that there are other ways\nTo spend our time and attention I was very pleased that last night President Trump did take a moment\nTo apologize for what was done to judge Kavanaugh in the

casualty of this whole process and sure enough\nIt was saved at the last moment but but understand that it was a very close fought battle it could have gone the other way and Democrats would have had no problem in fact they would have been gleeful had it gone the other way\nWouldn't have thought twice about what had been lost in this whole process despite all of that\nKavanaugh is bending over backwards doing everything in his power to make it quite clear that he will be\nA fair and dare I say judicious judge that he will do everything that he can to continue his legacy of\nDecades of public service you know Kevin all went to Yale undergrad yellow on top of his closet both he could have gone to any one of the big fancy law firms he would've made\nPartner he'd be making easily few million dollars a year right now easily instead he's a bit of a federal judge DC circuit court of appeals to me probably makes\nOn every now and less than two hundred grand or something like that\nWhich you could say well bug you still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he could be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary\nUnderstands that that's a very important role in very important service and\nThey don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was ... really universally praise and understood to be top of his field that's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right\nKavanaugh was the ... the ... gold standard choice he was in the go all in and try and own the lips choice\nSupreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick Kevin ... was the guy who was doing what he could in order to at least\nBe impartial as a judge should be whenever he hears cases and they tried to ruin him\nThey tried to destroy his life destroys families destroys reputation there is no more room for anyone who calls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives\nTake their arguments more seriously play more fair with them be a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument\nInstill the lives finally recognize that what they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done\nThat they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know to be good and right for the country no matter\nHow much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act\nLike a bunch of savages\nWe have to push forward and we have to stay United and we have to win Trump understands that\nThat said Kavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be nonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing and to try and heal the country and so and so much as possible warmth liquid to\nArticle three of the constitution provides a judicial power Shelby vested in one Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court as an institution of law it is not a partisan or political institution [noise] the justices do

not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation [noise]\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court to be a shirt that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he does what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court\nHe was with the majority opinion of almost all the time other judges looking at the law agree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interprets the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much but there is an underlying truths here and that is that the country is a better place with more respect\nFor the rules were there will be more respect the rule of law where every American\nWill have his rights more respected under the constitution because the judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice Kevin all\nLiberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court they just don't realize it because they don't really want somebody calling balls and strikes when it comes to the constitution they want to ring or they want somebody who will tell them yes\nThe constitution says that thing you wanted to say even though it doesn't\nAt least Kavanaugh will say I may not like this policy I may think this leads to bad outcomes in public life for a whole bunch of reasons but\nThis is what the constitution says this is what the case law tells us and with respect to precedent and all the other\nInterpretation issues that come to mind ed I'm not going to\nGive you the decision that I think I should based upon what I Want to give you the decision based on what is the law vicious where liberal separate from conservatives this is how we differ on the Supreme Court on the constitution and what all this means Scalia\nSchool is a perfect example he he would say look I I don't I don't agree with flag burning\nYou know but that doesn't mean that I think that there shouldn't be flag burning under the law was like I don't I don't like flag burning but you you should not be made illegal you know what I mean you look at some of these\nDecisions from very consider conservatives will protect the rights of liberal even on issues that they feel very passionately about and that they do not\nBecause it's about principle right they they do not agree with the end policy for progressive is all about the final outcome it's all about you know did Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Kagan and sort of my word it's that or did you did they\nGive us the semi divine rich from these judges over the Supreme Court these unelected super legislators did they give us what we want\nAnd that's how they ... Supreme Court which is why they have such a problem with Kavanaugh um but we have entered a a very interesting period right\nNow post Kavanaugh getting through heading into the midterms\nI don't know if the Democrat psyche can really handle that the collective psyche of the ... the Democrat Party can really handle what it means\nBut I disagree with bringing the Merrick Garland piece here if you're gonna bring in America and you've got to also bring in Harry Reid a limiting the filibuster for judges\nYou got to get into well on a second Democrats decided when they had power to take it to the mat take his limit and then they wanted to play the filibuster game when they had a Supreme Court nominee and Republicans had a majority so Republicans responded by saying well if you didn't like the block when it was on you we don't like the block but it's on us\nBut more importantly to compare what has happened to judge Kavanaugh justice capital thank you\nTo Merrick Garland okay Marco and didn't get a vote no one tried to no one tried to destroy America Arlene's entire life no one tried to ruin his reputation\nYou know there's real psychological damage that has done to people from false allegations people have been as was the case and the to want to ... driven to suicide by false allegations especially when that involves false allegations of rape or sexual solved\nBecause you are an untouchable in society even your own loved ones you know friends and family may think differently if you if they believe that it's true\nI think anybody with a brain news the Capitol did not do these things certainly his own family knew he did not do these things was completely innocent of it but to compare the Merrick Garland situation to Kevin or even bring them up in the same sentence I think lacks\nJudgment I think that that is a poor context or for the overall discussion but then he made one other point which was a good one is you know a a ... I got a call balls and strikes\nThere says that the only way that this gets fixed as if the American people hold the Democrats responsible at the polls yeah\nThat is the only the only check on the mob

the bad guys based on this underlying media narrative and once you start to put it in those terms once you were willing to speak about it in an open way you're not saying oh gosh that can't really know that is true\nThen much of what we've seen here with the whole Kavanaugh debacle and I say that about the process it's as any of you listening to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's

it is a scary time\nFor men and in response a singer songwriter named Lindsey labs Stewart out of Texas wrote a parody song of that statement I suppose we could say it's a scary time for women according to a her assessments but ah here's look she's got she's she's talented here's out some of it goes plate\nIn name only\nI Can't you do when you might end in Ninety and anger management I\nMean and again if\nYou're not you're not there any\nOkay now\nAs I said they're nice voice obviously has some talent political analysis is not one of them\nA few things you said about any people say oh buckets art and she was running okay but she's this was a parody song she's being a political point so I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to what the president said about how it's a scary time to be a man she says things like it is or rather ... you can't\nHave the windows open when you're a woman home alone no if you live in an unsafe neighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme\nI'm considering also that America is at the now the bottom end of a fifty year decline in violent crime I I think that that's a little that's a a little bit extreme but and then to say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone\nWell I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women in my day and let them go to the bar without a chaperone\nAnd I know plenty of women who wear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to where many screw it whenever they chose to not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into a GM is when someone\nYeah I'm somebody else on Twitter or you know writes them on Facebook or who would say whatever they felt like saying so why are we being told that these are all things that women can't do why make these claims that are ridiculous Clinton's\nNow that's not to say that that things don't happen\nTo women every day across the country and there aren't bad men out there who perpetrate horrible crimes with someone of of course we all know that that we're we're having we're trying to have an adult conversation here we're not having a conversation\nAbout oh you're saying that there's no this is what the left does producing search result is it a problem of course of ...\nIt's a it's a heinous crime a felony for which people are severely punished as they should be\nBut there is a hysteria and this is what I'm really\nTrying to get out with the lyrics in this song and the way that the media talks about this there's this hysteria among leftist feminists\nRape culture on campus rape culture is I mean there is no ... culture on campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nUh so what where is this coming from\nAnd I mean the truth is that the same identity politics to be very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nIt also applies to the way that the left views the role of women or the the the ... if you will the the position of women in American society and it's\nJust not in keeping with reality and that is\nVery troubling because once again we have this problem of how do you engage with the other side when you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side on issues like women walk\nAround dressing I mean I'm here in D.C I've lived in their ... this is this is not the Taliban version of America would walk around dressing however the water as they will showed\nAnd women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what\nWhat would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world\nAnd and there's something inherently that feels a little\nUh on just about claiming publicly in this way\nAnd it's not just the singers on this or this is common among the ... that that that men especially men who will say things like well ... that we don't care about these issues that as a slur that as a slender\nJust not true why did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies\nThey really do think that one in five women and sexually assaulted or because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted

storm\nDamage your argument you\nWith this place so ah the reality of the U.S ambassador position is that it's a two un is is that it doesn't really make that much difference why people are so focused on it now\nIs that Nikki Haley is an interesting political figure in the Trump orbit she's obviously female she's a half South Asian and so she has a ... you know people think of her as a minority female she is a minority female or you know she has\nMinority female or in her background or rather she is by background of minority female\nUm\nShe's also liked by the establishment people think that Nikki Haley is in that circle of Trump Administration officials who are not surprises Judy the beltway swamp types right I mean there's there's Mattis there's Nikki\nHaley um there's\nTrying to think of who else would be you know you think of who who would be in the rules are in now in any administration\nThat's going to the game you can Play Doh Kelly is chief of staff I mean there there are some people but certainly are well within what your expectations would be for the role that they have 'em but the Trump Administration is non\nTraditional and that is included a lot of nontraditional appointments but so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought to be\nEstablishment approved a and so when she left initially when she announced her resignation there was a moment of oh my God what does this mean and as I said you I don't think it means very much at all\nI think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks oh that was gonna say pumped but I I I don't think pump pale would have been secretary of state in the mother minister ration but he's\nA former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I didn't compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established he's a Tea Party congressman I Know but still um\nBut I don't think ... this matters all that much people find it interesting because the dynamics between Trump and\nAnd and Haley and the others in his cabinet who were thought of as being\nVery Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump ... is increasingly I've always thought it was a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted that means is kicking button taking names so\nWhilst they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh ...\nBecause they're soft in the GOP that Nikki\nHaley is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee now let's just pull that\nDown to earth for a moment here uh does anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six answers now they got no idea\nI Am I absolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman\nCertainly fits into what all these political journalist like to do just come up with a narrative that interests people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different twenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation is Bill Bill the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll ah never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty of speculation is easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this but those are all I think so and so it was going to run on ... part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nI'll be honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that you necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling candidate because here's here's what the what did you always gotta remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish in a minority you know in fact what it said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side who achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTraded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh and then she was a a a gender trades her which I suppose is is now he's saying [noise]\nUm but I think that uh you know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day and so everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into play quits wealth\n[noise] I'm not leaving at the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good faith effort to actually ask her to come in fact in great day in the United states and I'm proud tens and part of the team now I don't have anything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when\nI got an hour or six years and we've dealt with a hurricane fountain near ... shooting associating with a lot and then look how many\nYears have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years have intact and I'm a believer in her mind that I think you have to the southwest enough to know when you\nFound in the house someone else to do the jobs have\n\nThere you go pardon on good terms reputation intact didn't have some big or injure personal blow up with the ministry ration that's why she's leaving folks I I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy or story than that and if if there is also that you know but for now\nIt is what it is Nikki Haley's hadn't out\nDoesn't really matter who cares [laughter] that's my analysis\nOf it I Know a book no what do you do it uh but I I Do want to spend a little time with you on the\nMidterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now\nKind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing and creating permits ability in and you know would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops\nServing in these countries are serving in in a war zones\nAnd overall things are really good right now\nOr the media the mainstream in his in his backyard but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset\nThat is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the less going to these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment on the radio\nI got [noise]\n\nHow does one never missed a customer again when customers called check your email expressed to me automatically engages them with your digital content\nSimple text flyers coupons menus priceless video audio or anything else expressed to me it's much like tax\nIsn't going to convince any I don't think any moderates are centrists to who are really dying right here is you know and key in the house races you need Republicans to get some upset victories uh but yeah I don't think there's going to convince people to do that necessarily but what do you think about where we are as a country right now\nAnd what they have gone to this president along the way it is bonkers its role special counsel and the and the investigation and the the grinding machinery of this\nA special counsel bureaucracy chewing people up costing them fortunes in legal fees threatening everybody with perjury charges all of this Trump is how to do this with that Obama didn't have that Obama didn't have that for his first two years in office okay and\nAnd you look at the comparisons over people say oh inherited you know that yeah there was an economic reset from decades of bad policy when it came to housing and lending which by the way it was pushed by social justice warriors that's a whole other conversation\nBut the bank bailout everyone was at the bank bailout happened on Bush's watch tarp is what happened on a or rather the stimulus pardon me ... the stimulus is what happened on Obama's watch\nThat's what a ... which was a trillion dollars of what exactly does that do oh that's right give a lot of money away the Democrat grab bag issues and causes and and buddies and special interests\nThat's what the stimulus trillion dollars of just you know Democrats spending stuff on whatever they want to spend money on to help the economy that was your money they spent\nThe bailout of the banks occur when Trump was in office right so I'm Sorry when Bush was in office so there's a whole thing that Obama turn the economy around no everything he did actually made the ... made the slowest most painful economic recovery since the great depression\nSo this is just a rewriting of history they're engaged an end in Obama's last two years in office they were trying to excuse the weak economic growth they were trying to excuse the\nOf optimism about the corporate investing environment in this country about jobs and wages and how they were stagnant that they were coming up with anything to make Obama seemed like he was oh just so great\nAnd now the narrative of the hold together Trump has been doing a fantastic job he really has I Would love to see the Republicans stay
