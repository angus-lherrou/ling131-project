death\nYou're going to have some media outlets that act like this is the bombing of Pearl Harbor all over again they're going to anchor this is a tremendous threat to democracy um and that's why when you look at\nThis latest charge here this is going to ... they're going to make a much bigger deal of this this just came out today they're gonna make a much bigger deal of his than ah than they should\nAnd it's because of all these political reasons quote federal prosecutors in the wall Street Journal today have charged a Russian national with conspiring to influence next month's midterm elections according to a criminal complaint unsealed friday the first known case involving the November race\nJustice Department described Elena Alex safe now who's ... yeah you know of a good yeah yeah no vote while it's not an easy one of St Petersburg Russia as the chief accounting of an effort funded by a Russian oligarch and two companies he controls including a Russian company that's been indicted\nBy special counsel Robert Mueller\nBefore the complaint was unsealed friday U.S intelligence agencies had expressed concern over election interference citing Russia and China in a Chinese and Iranian countries trying to interfere\nThey added no evidence that voting or vote counts were affected state and local governments prevented the attempts okay what I've been saying all along is now if you're a foreign government that really doesn't like\nOh you have to do is metal a tiny little bit just a just a little bit of meddling and you get this greatly magnified effect because the media wants to excuse Democrat Party wants an excuse for why Hillary last thank God it with a whole Russian meddling nonsense but\nNow that they've convinced a lot of Americans that already won election was changed because of this this ... this is highly repeatable you can do this over and over it's not that difficult and you don't have to be successful I because they took all context out of the discussion there was no longer did they change\nOh did this actually shift the election or any particular state or or in any meaningful way or was this just\nThrowing out there some means and some fake Facebook stuff and that shifted perception you can never really gauge how much impact that shift had but it did something\nAnd something means that you can always say the election was tainted now Russia or China or Iran any country doesn't even have to be sophisticated they have the ability to with a minimum of any financial outlay with a minimum of of anything from there and they can\nAffect the outcome of an election right they they can change how much a trust we have an electoral process and\nIf you're looking to undermine democracy the great irony here is that because\nThe last thing the Democrats hyper ventilated so much about the last Russian interference campaign every one that comes after this is likely to be\nGreatly exaggerated in the minds of a lot of people and now whenever and whenever one side of the political aisle loses there'll be at least some faction within it back and say she change election you know that's what this election was\nMarred by outside efforts to try to change things so\nAnd I would also note that the Russians and the Chinese maybe even the Iranians are going to get more sophisticated doing this to\n... they're not going to just stop that these are relatively minor and innocuous space but campaigns ah some of the other things that I've been going on they're going to get more advanced\nBut back to this this federal complaint that just came out today or this is what it says in the journal piece ms ... yeah you know of a so I don't know how you say that because you know a\nA managed the effort called project locked which targeted the U.S election and worked with a total operating budget of more than thirty five million dollars between January twenty six sheen and June twenty Eighteen the complaint said\n... ah Mitch K all call her played a key role and what project luck I describe this information warfare against the United states\nInformation warfare is a pretty strong way of saying getting them to try to vote for one side of the political aisle or the other um remember they're not trying to convince us do have a a bloody revolution the streets are trying to convince people to vote for drop or vote for Hillary or\nVote for whomever um but I I just think that we've lost we lost so much\nOf the ability to contextualize this ... and understand what really matters what's really important and and what's not um they're they're getting way ahead of their skis on this one\nSo we've got now now we've got the OJ charges about Russian interference in midterms who wants to guess whether the Democrats are going to

launched a Snapchat accounts I Love those messages disappear all by themselves did your wife is\nLike with a cloth or no no no they did you say I don't know how it works this way at all\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is can absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now\nThe fact is we had four dead Americans with a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night a decided they'd go kill some Americans what difference at this point does it make how much\nDo you miss her to you know we want her to give you a little mom does the so you remember what it was like when you had to deal with Hillary all the\nTime [noise]\nAh yes Hillary you probably think to yourself like most normal people would oh Hillary is run for president unsuccessfully twice there is no way that she would be show\nDiluted and so self involved in so self important and Meg Whitman article that\nShe would run again but all I Do listen to that ... and fellow sometimes on the radio he can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year regularly that Hillary Clinton may run again\nAnd I keep saying I Know I mean 'cause I'm Crazy\nKnow everyone's going to tell me I'm nuts but oh guess what a you know it's government\nFirst time that I can think of at least twenty Eighteen you have a top a Clinton aide Philippe Reines who is a veteran spokesmen and console yes they are saying that yes\nIt's a it's possible here's resent his political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversational or informal form of polling as they twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years is it that she's run before\nThis would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support jihad sixty five million people vote for her it was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made and twenty sixteen\nShocking last up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the debt\nWhen asked about the likelihood of a running rains responded it is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not\nZero now let me tell you something right now\nAre there is a very very higher than zero much more realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about a ... that she will run and that's why they're starting it as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting one what they're trying to do\nIs just start start rehabilitating that perception they have to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary what am I Am in telling all along\nThere's an entire apparatus of people around her who believe that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs they all have the drapes picked out for their officers they were ready to go\nAnd that was all taken from they believe taken from them by\nThe Russians they believe taken from them by this uh this unholy alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative as I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes you will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running it makes more sense for who Hillary to run that Biden or Bernie\nMakes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary\nBut this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that\nThe case for Hillary from a Democrat perspective the case for Hillary is more rational then the case for most of the other candidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they just you know what it is they just can't stomach it\nThey just feel like they had to just show down a lot of nasty stuff\nIn order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it\nAnd there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may have to do it again\nAnd they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance that Hillary Clinton runs right now you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of twenty five percent\nI'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's a serious serious\nShot that she decides to run and mad wouldn't that just be while\nWe can replace a twenty six you know election in twenty twenty\nAnd all the same cast of characters all over again\n[noise] I mean I'm I'm not sure if people would know it would be a ... it would be a ratings bonanza and the good news is books that\nAre very confident that if that were to happen and guess what\nTrump would again [noise]\nLove ... I Love doing this show every day because I get to share my thoughts with all of you all across the country in some cases all over the\nIt's incredible but I also want you to be able to share your thoughts with me and with each other and not have to worry about left wing by his or any of these social media moderators set aside\nYou're going to get Shadow Bear or you're just not going to see things in your feet anymore than are conservative you know you can't talk about guns 'cause that that one of the second amendment oh that must be bad too\nNippy dot com is the place you should go\nTo David ... is a new social media platform that gives you all the functionality that you're used to a posting writing to each other putting up videos putting up photos but it doesn't have any of that left wing biased nonsense and they'd be dot com is totally free to join totally free to set up to post everything about it as an\nI.

storing pet food medical records and supplies and waterproof containers and keep their favorite comfort toy handy this one or this one proper identification microchip\nShe doesn't sound very well adjusted to me is putting that out there\nWhy why why did someone who lives about his drinking\nHe didn't this was one of the more pathetic lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his drinking\nHe said he drank sometimes sometimes too much when you start to try to play around with well look it's not too much like way way too much so it's a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe does that would that qualify as perjury or but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did not live at a strict he said he didn't blackout and he said that he would drink too much sometimes\n... the Democrats went so far is to try to put high school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop that but it was pathetic which goes to show that they have no scruples nothing stops them nothing prevents them from you know just going all in all this stuff\nBut that was Ted Cruz in an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there well for a lot of reasons one is you just said them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nYou would never occur to me and I know never heard any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them\nBecause of what they stand for publicly when it ... it just would never occur to me now\nI'm not saying to talk to somebody to engage somebody and if you was elected represented ... but this is yelling this is heckling citizen trying to have a conversation I'm sure\nThis is not meant to in any way be constructive they're they're not engaging Ted Cruz they're mouthing Ted Cruz this is what they do they like the foreign mobs and also reminded\nMe when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that I don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I didn't I was unwilling to her didn't want to you I just had so much else going on there but you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assaulted\nAnd that's\nIf if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves you know support and sympathy\nBut that created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of well it it because something bad happened\nTo me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges a because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in the third person it means that this this case should be influenced by that\nThat's that's crazy this is just\nA it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you imagine if I had a uh I I was on trial for a steely right I was in ... for fraud\nAnd people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so he must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant but for the left it was a\nWidespread talking point the whole cabinet thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for context and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not\nThis is really elementary stuff and that this was a something that people are losing sight of and a lot of people are losing sight of just I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize this entire thing had had become\nA there there is a a mass hysteria in this country that Democrats have reached this point where I don't think that the king ah logically\nAbout many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want to show rage and they want to signal there virtue to the world\nAnd they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect that other people will listen to them other people here are their thoughts and because ... there's so much claiming a victim status\nNow when everyone's saying oh I'm a victims do you have to listen to me ah their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from the identity of the particular speaker of the justification that becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because I suffered some terrible tragedy it was very\nTroubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality to bring this back to the Trump is saying here you know do you want\nPeople who easily get swept up into mob thinking to be the ones who are electing representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and you know there's been not nearly enough condemnation\nOf the kinds of tactics that the left has been embracing recently and I think there's been a lot well we know there's a lot of endorsing of it but it's been not nearly\nA enough and I find that a fund that\nDisquieting to say the least so there you have but you know we're gonna talk this quiet and\nStupid celebrities are all over the

up and drop that sure\nOh yeah the DNA results show that lives with war and can't do math or isn't very smart or both or or is just I think I think delusional if that's probably the most likely outcome there but Nikki Haley of did a good job at the Al Smith dinner\nAnd it was she had some great opportunities there and she took them with with some good jokes and I do think that her\nMove all long hair has been she's good with she's in good with the Trump people she's going to help Donald Trump won a second term she is a perfect candidate to run a once Trump has had a second term I I don't people are saying pants I don't know about that I I don't see parents at the at that level but\nI've I've been wrong before us as everybody who tries to make these kinds of predictions\nOh it's been a British as I did say at least on rising\nEarlier this week that a minute you would not go Steven Mnuchin the treasury secretary would not go to Saudi Arabia after what happened with the show gave we don't have really much the way new developments on that I Would note there are still people who are spending a lot of time covering the story but there's not\nA lot out there in terms of new verifiable\nAre facts and I've got to say um you know that's a ... it's just going to be at the end exactly what I thought which is that these the Saudis are going to say that this was a rogue operation\nUm but beating up on Trump was clearly what a lot of this has been about all along\nAnd I you know and and Bernie Sanders sometimes I get a little caught up it was like the only person who's ... who's like burn the it's burned the night and the mood is right for socialism um but then I remember that he's actually a far left progressive in and we'll say a lot of things that are\nVery annoying and very very untrue or and he went after Trump on this whole issue of of ... is that in the last twenty four hours and I I was disappointed in the burn play sixteen\nHe's not such a tough guy what he has to deal with this billionaire friends in Saudi Arabia [noise]\nDo just tortured and murdered courageous journalist on such a tough guy well not one\nNot such a tough guy\nWhat he's

eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you'd call right now you'll also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend\nBut you must call right now because of this special radio offer is not available in stores or on line so that number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five

you're not going to be enrolled in one of those automatic monthly subscription programs this is a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\n[noise] so how 'bout if folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body's still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamins these three is\nThe activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the ... going to end up going up and out through the roof where it should be wow\nSo Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short developments and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for\nPregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties that's the way you know you start and more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you'd start feeling sick or you can't golf he

everybody\nFive K. C. S. J.\nFive Ninety Days yesterday dot com and on your phone with our by arguing\nThat other states and other rally ... Fox News President Trump hosting a campaign rally in al ... for combat Republican senator Dean Heller\nIs that people are going to act senator dean to protect\nWhile now so I've done that is also a section for interviews a section for monologues and some some news stories of love to inside\n\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions\nOr was it the power of a bill when it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nIt's going to be one point six billion come on to what the hell is going on one point six\nDollars if you imagine\nThat would be nuts that would be absolutely nuts [noise] All right let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren\nFor decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes if it's okay for them it's okay for me\nShe's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first woman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\nShe's been making this clean but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian\nSo the president like he's apt to has been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls are both gone is I was just funny as hell people who are offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou don't like Rachel does all who's white\nLike Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretend to be black Elizabeth Warren\nIt seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves it no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said do a DNA test if you could prove to be that you're an Indian or give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test get to the test back and\nGives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write those big story that you prove that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American and then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and corrected and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth\nNative American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into the actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American made of blood both the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this group that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than listen to warn that's affected\nMe making it up as a fact she's not America in American indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself or did he or\n\nShe is so not American it'd be about the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a\n[noise]\nGerald the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation vets the world in which we live\nGuy looked at stake in it\nAny time you go through this week thinking that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week and I think to yourself while she will use Native American and by the way this is not a story anybody any Russian even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse through lying\nTo get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this for even a second yet for some reason we\nHad to have her thrust of this in our face again why decided I had to do a a a pax power to you about the color Pocahontas all have their free will come back if you're not familiar with my packs parodies I'd take a song that you know and love and I ruined it by changing the wars in singing it\nAbout a current event Pocahontas when we come back your phone calls as well one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot coms there\nOn the radio on the Web five Ninety eight I\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in

them and treat mom that sound when Joe leading to talk about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about a little band called the ... we were when we were playing music or radio present in the studio check it out now\n\nWhen radio stations across the land Joe ... was with her in the room emails All right here's a live video feed is there as well as easy to get through tough thing just press play\nWhere you open it up on your on your device or when you open it up on your computer or you've got the weekend with Joe ... had a great opportunity to talk to my friend Eric Trump earlier this week of course the son of president Donald Trump on all things that you would imagine we talked about Eric I appreciate Joe are you\nHey bags how are you I'm living the dream but it's it's going great today I'm ... and we've got a big debate too and I was you know it's going to be Ted Cruz speaking on a Robert ... going in so ... for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen and it's only ... tonight\nIn that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right\n[noise] let's see if they gave her a thing for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and the the amount you I hear people say to me what my guy guys Trump is on the you know he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nGo as a country we're winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire it's four point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation four one K. through the roof of small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were\nA year ago which is just created such a you know financial engine um I mean we are doing so incredible and that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done you opioid crisis he's taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm you know and no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now is you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right oh while America has the strongest economy that's ever hatch who's winning this thing right and and\nThat's what he promised the American people he was going to do he promised the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get used to be used to the country and but people have to get out there and they have to get out and vote\n... Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but I watch these races each very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you remove all the advertising is saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate friends the top one percent of the vast majority of tax cut everybody else got nothing ... that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cuts and corporations will employers Scott tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them walking around with him about it\nHonestly they are truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty of politics again this is this in a world right where business people who are not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world these people are truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean\nYou look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or\nYou know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses right all across our\nOur nation they're getting they're paying Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he flashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest\nHispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\n... you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where\nIf you had the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five fifty percent and terrorists right where they can make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean who do you think's gonna win that battle I I mean it's absolutely unbelievably we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the\nStock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote if you have to realize the lies and deception\nThat some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases believe\nMe people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that and then they terms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer jumping national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go ... or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone be slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada should no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way to do it but maybe it'd be all do you use it in a way we're going to do with them they made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back and how we are to check\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world has to be able to\nKeep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um legislation that road has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs if you look at right to try you look at so many of these

hard it was to raise money for the movie plus of course we have the dog\nPocahontas we've talked midterms Michelle I appreciate Joe are you\nGood how are you doing I'm doing great ... listen thanks for taking a ton of want to jump into the guys know movie a which show that piqued my interest the other day and that's why I reached out to you but you're not start with Elizabeth Warren it turns out is one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American some out in the left BDO Michelle now says she's basically like a Cherokee queen I mean that's right what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by the lengths to which the identity politics left will go to write you try and unwind\nBlatant life this is a woman who advanced her her career by manufacturing a a Native American ancestry that it's been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was\nConvinced that by releasing their results of a test\nThat showed that cheap possibly had Native American ancestry six to ten generation back yeah but that was based on a proxy of Native American blood line right and in other words the the researcher used South American\nGenetic markers as as some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really at this ancestry come on Joe this is someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure a position in a in a prestigious Ivy League university\nIn a very real way Rachel does all is about as black is this woman is Native American and you're right they're using like ... as tech they're hoping praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be an Internet site and in\nFact by statistics that were quoted and none other than the New York times it turns out that this one thousand one one one thousand twenty fourth fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes her last\nThe ... in other words than the average white American ... more Native American ancestry than she does\nA hundred percent you're absolutely right about that in the Boston Globe trying to say that she was one thirty second at the at the most and one one thousand twenty fours at the least they even had to update that four hours later and say okay maybe one sixty force at at the moment\nBut what show it was an I'm Italian I'm English are polish and Irish or you know these things and I'm I'm I'm actually you know about\nTwo thirds Italian than the other stuff falls into place I have no clue for one one thousand sixty fours anything else\nAnd nobody can ever we I don't think you could ever really find that out but they have one tiny little marker on one tiny little fraction of a scale and may think Trump's you don't need a million dollars and apologized to her help me understand\nYeah yeah you know the the rich irony in a serious point is that this week I'm a very important cases being litigated by legitimate Asian American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and there was an Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions documents showing that they were discriminated because they were Asian American and there were\nToo many of them and the university system and it just goes to show you that you know the the the Olympics of grieving\nAnd the Olympics of identity politics brings us exactly to the to this point in time and and it's and it and I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color and yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama\nI've had\nAll of these white progressive left is shouting at me that I'm not really my ethnicity because of my beliefs\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color that they're not people of color while they're bracing stony like Rachel those all end and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd all through shown getting in there as well each Oh yes
