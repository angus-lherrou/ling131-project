our\nGift in your children's novel that one\nWas able to show during the presidential debates if she were the Democratic candidate all this being left out by the way by the\nMedia that's for a feverishly and fervently trying to cover for Elizabeth Warren some reason to the words are coming out I could be one way or the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with that keeps happening today\nBut she released the information from her her test today right uh she has decided\nTo let the world know that her long scrutinized and many would say the bong Native American heritage\nIs now back in the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe\nWhere the vast majority of warrants family tree is European it says that she has a date of American ancestry quote in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so this is a really a non scientific\nBackground ed and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it\nBetween one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American and the Boston Globe and actually do\nThe math wrong on that one uh so I'm I'm here to to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here\nAnd this was this was a truly jaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because this was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren's will this wasn't a some surprise\nThat a a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop and make it difficult for her to get elected\nTo the contrary Elizabeth Warren took the position that this would\nBolster her claim\nI don't know which is worse here um that Elizabeth Warren is\nShow delusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it has to think that this will stop continue mockery of her for racial fraud I mean the hill where I work\nIn response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the the real headline here if I may finally be civil is it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago\nAnd since then it has been one long on on on a drop in line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American compared to the general white American population she is less than average\nIn her connection to the Native American population meeting you and to me listening is if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have any white an American is likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are here\nWe are she she must have thought that this was going to give her some degree of of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago\nThere's no realistically there's no way to know if even the ten generations ago if this is accurate and then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis and you start to read some of this you\nThat this is all it's all kind of have\nBeing nonsense anyway quote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of orange DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford a really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on ad mix and Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago um this folks if Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person is that if Elizabeth Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American\nLiterally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American\nFor professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even matter if you call yourself [noise] Native American it would no longer make any difference\nIf you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but we're all Native American by the standard is\nCompletely nuts\nIt's just completely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to\nTo force this incredible uh on for stare on on her part\nIs just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top\nFour or five of early support from the Democrats for running for\nPresident and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as big CNN pull out where I think she came in for third or fourth place\nUm and and when you look at this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat each amazing\nTo me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter] I mean she's\nShe's like one one thousand Native American may be and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border\nInto the United states so she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes and yet\nPeople in the media were things juicy proved that Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up\nNow what what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh\nElizabeth Warren has completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and so there that the media has\nTo go even further and they have to somehow pretend like\nYeah that's right you prove that that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it\nBut well what else are they going to do I mean this is\nA this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nEighties bonkers\nAnd on this notion even that that she has any Native American ancestry let me just give you this is from this post a this analysis in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans\nIs particularly tricky because there was an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison this is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases\nTo make up for the ... a dearth of Native American DNA bustamante guy during this analysis used samples from Mexico Peru and Columbia just stand in for Native American that's because\nScientists believe that the groups Americans

that\nAnd I think that that's that's fair that's true that's accurate I not African American and and it's a dishonest thing and it would be a dishonest thing for me to claim that I was African American okay but why is that\nA terrible thing deserving of appropriate ... why is that something that we can all agree the media would get so upset about and Elizabeth Warren doing the exact same thing with Native American ancestry 'cause I could clean one percent African and I'm American or an African American\nLives with one of the exact same thing they're willing to try to excuse they're trying to find some way to tell us all it's not really of it and then either didn't matter or it's not true or she is native of the craziest history is Native American\nI mean no no serious person takes that should take that perspective but lots of media outlets are I mean I mean the biggest ones folks I mean the biggest ones the same ones that ... that treated the cabin on allegations that fact\nWithout any evidence those same media outlets now oh surprise surprise are acting like yeah she's she's proven or case here she's clearly she's clearly Native American not nothing to nothing to point out beyond that\nThe media should be oh show deeply embarrassed all this but\nAs we know they're not they are running interference they're active is they have chosen a side here and right now they're gal\nIs in some trouble so what\nAre they doing are they being a fact\nFinder so they speaking truth to power are they doing the best analysis and report and they can no of course not they're throwing up smokescreen even if they're flimsy even if they know that they won't withstand scrutiny they're doing everything that they tend\nTo give her either a a little bit of wiggle room to get out of this jam she's put herself in or just to to delay the full force and fury of the news cycle against her and and hope that something else comes up tomorrow\nAnd that's what they're trying to do here that's what the that's what the real plan is so I Would just note that whenever Trump called them fake news and they get so upset maybe they should just stop being fake news and then he won't call them anymore\nAnd then you also have just Trump's instinctual political brilliance here by calling was worn out and not being afraid to use the word Pocahontas or the name Pocahontas not being afraid to go where people say oh you can't do that\nHe has exposed her for a pathetic phoning in a fraud absolute fraud on the radio on\nDot com [noise]\n\nDo you have something you want to say but few you

media and to also or as a little more shall we say willing to take a a point of view\nThat would be well received by academia and the media on a whole bunch of things on I've noticed is before generals started to get very political and journals like we love is this tremendous I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon of that\nFor example a lot of the stuff that came out of a general portray as I was not surprised by it all\n'cause I had known for a long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much\nTrying for his own purposes to to create this narrative of portray us as the the greatest military might have a generation I Would I Would just point out that before\nEven are being brought low by the extramarital affair and the woman and the classified information that he didn't ... you know all of a sudden you already know about and he had to plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are a hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines fixture rock but his strategy was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work\nI Would note that strategy that he tried in Afghanistan\nDid not work was not working and was never going to work\nAnd he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case\nSo while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all his credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation in Afghanistan and understand that he's not ... was not this\nUh men beyond reproach when it came to his ... certainly not beyond reproach period but also when it came to this rather so that's much more of saying I Need to do a little more\nI Need a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much\nPositive stuff about matters for so long and maybe he just rub the present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to comment Democrat I also this kind of funny that the president\nUses calling somebody a Democrat as kind of a a little sly or you know\n... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat you know it's like when I say my uh my ... my guys okay it's kind of a communist\nSo Trump says he's kind of a Democrat he also said that you know that Trump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category\nOf oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to we need to make sure that we run all these stories about how Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love these White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so then I take a step back then I say hold on a minute\nGiven what we know about all the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including Republicans\nWho are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump it all we know that there's somebody right now who roads\nIf you if you believe in New York Times and I don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial as we never found out of this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody in the White House of course the ... to do that and that's also why I give him more leeway than I Would then other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if your Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become Turner coats on it\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent recognition within party circled I mean you're talking about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be in Shane\nFor the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me that he was really some of them you know there are telling you what I mean it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the\nFacade of you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to build this report\nAnd then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better you know they're like off the record\nI volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building is that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so I guess\nSo ah and then you know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here with Leslie stall in this interview uh had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left\nAnd the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position a since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that they stole the descent and they always do well it's your policy\nIt's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's has but no it's the law and I don't think\nThat they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand that to say that it's\nThe law is to say that it's actually the Congress that does bear some of if not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either a napped or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is to find a way to adjust a law\nThat it's a bad law or to repeal it entirely isn't really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration for him when he felt\nFrustrated with Congress ... articles er Cox an editor what am I correct\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcement it's not just about enforcement when you don't for something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted by Congress\nAnd I think that's\nPart of this that just immediately that the the press puts aside for pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would uh they would be in a place where\nTrump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be or they would be just crushed because of what I've been going on at the border and I think that they miscalculated\nThat for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told that you know immigrants or do jobs or whatever the legal ... folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for the economy\nAnd they would like to have some reestablish mental the rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has and build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house but\nAll this on this issue of the body can tell lovely so she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children\nHappened under Obama it's a law that still on the books that was the law when Obama was an office and oh by the way the people that were getting separated from the children at the border were overwhelmingly explicitly trying to break US law\nSaudi Arabia reportedly has plans to admit that a Saudi journalist was
