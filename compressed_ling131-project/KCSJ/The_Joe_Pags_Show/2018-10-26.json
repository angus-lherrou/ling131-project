spend the rest of his life in prison\nIt's just a question of how soon we put him through that process but the dirty bombs that have been found so far no could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances\nThere was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia\nBut they talked about how the bombs that haven't gone off it kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the M y pd is going to have to say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment that the largest police department the country's as no these are these are\nThe odds and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know what to do it and\nThen we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs or the NYPD can't take that risk not yet can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think\nThat is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go there but then again I actually\nProfessionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have\nTended to get bucks slapped rather hard here's what I see if you were trying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh which\nWas toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh debacle self inflicted wound was toxic\nAnd the caravan making its way up through Mexico the far left active is when the Democratic party loves this story um but the people and places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electro prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here\nNow is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one\nIncredibly stupid reckless and a ... and really her doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump so much they thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threaten people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that if this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the time and\nIf the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging to the Democrats and in the process\nMake the anti Trump media seem sympathetic and give them something to talk about that might sway some moderate to their side just in time the election would this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy\nI'm not saying happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black answers obviously yes\nSo that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I I refuse to take the position that well because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for this\nThat's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line the Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly they have created this vicious toxic political environment\nThey have never thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my on my TV show or in the week you said yes this is the first time ever that there's been impeachment talk for a president who had not even been sworn in\nThey have a mass delusion problem they're having a collective nervous breakdown in slow motion over Trump and his movement and that's\nWhy things have become so tense and so nasty and so vicious\nSo would one individual change that dynamic you know we will\nHold our final conclusions until we have more evidence but in the meantime I'm leaving open all reasonable options and some that the Democrats want to shut down or a long way from deserving that got a jam

going to continue to point out contrast the policy between Democrats and Republicans people absolutely have a choice to make\nA on what they believe in and it couldn't be clear and we're going to see that happen and the next couple of weeks when the elections take place and the president's going to continue to lay out that case but at the same time we're condemning violent and calling on all Americans to come together\nThere is a big difference between a comment made an action taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican they fulfill\nThat should be a pretty pretty clear line right\nThe standard here Asian some big shock it's not some huge surprise it's not something that we need to take a step back from an ... hold on a second ... how do we how do we do this how do we deal with this right you are not responsible for what someone else does because of your politics\nYou may be responsible for violence if you directly incite violence and that's why even with our First Amendment there are some exceptions for incitement to violence right if you're in front of a big crowd you say burned down that store across the street and then they burned down that store you or morally called the Boeing and legally\nLiable for that matter\nYou know but but if you say I think we should have lower taxes in this country and then someone hears that and they run down and they like the IRS building on fire you are not responsible for that okay because if that were the case I think about how that could be abused think about the way this would expand the hecklers veto\nThink about how that would shut down discussion and debate\nAnytime somebody wanted to discredit a political belief audiologist all they have to do is have one person yes that's right and false like fashion\nAct like a complete idiot\nAll they have to do and that everyone says oh see see that and it's just common by the way you see this with\nThis is a a continuation of the debate you have with radical Islam the left will always rush to say the radical Islam is not in any way representative of Islam and then any jihad or jihad is aren't representative of the broader Islamic faith they will say that\nAnd then when you responsible hold on a second I mean who are you to\nAre you to to declare what isn't is not Islamic remember Obama sat at the un future does not belong to those whose land or the prophet of Islam one of the strangest things us presidents ever said and that kind of form\nA but they'll fight tooth and nail on that one meanwhile if some guy you know somewhere who's white named Billy Bob\nUh says something mean to somebody and and says something racist or whatever to someone and commits a hate crime that one incident is magnified it did it by the media is oh my gosh there's look at all the hate in this country\nLook at how hateful we there's three hundred and twenty million of us wanted idiots somewhere did something bad but he's white and male and on the right so that means that the right has to own this whole thing\nBecause because one guy said something racist because one racist incident when is it the exception when is it the norm this is a very important perception game that the media engages in all the time\nAnd this is where we can't we can't give any ground we do not have a political culture that embraces mob tactics intimidation and violence similar to what the left as we just simply do not\nDoesn't matter that there's one incident this one individual has done this this has been roundly condemn we ... with ... there's not a single conservative of any standing anywhere in the country who was at anything other than this was disgusting this person should spend the rest of his life in prison or work with persons it's probably one guy but we'll see\nBut on the left you'll hear well there's no there's no such thing as mobs really there's no problem with getting up in people's faces and yelling at them there's no reason to demand\nCivility when you're dealing with a political party that his show on uncivil in its ideas according to people\nLike Hillary Clinton [noise] the less as radical off we are the ones who are holding the torch of American values and freedom and western civilization in this country they're the ones who are kicking the load bearing walls of all of that\nDo not forget that for one moment in this debate that we're currently having in this

O. J. ... three specific felonies conspiracy to defraud the United states oh barring the over broad but\nGot to show both sides live under it um favorite tool of more\nMature early false statements to federal officials and deliberate obstruction of a federal investigation\nWow Oh yes this needs to happen I think ... no fool grassy is a serious and very powerful guy in the Senate\nAnd this referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this\nAnd that means folks that there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not\nA standard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh take their phone records that were there no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane and I'm so I'm going to say this I Am so proud of what\nWe did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was\nA really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we held the line we kept our shield sigh yes we did\nWe held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending have it all and we here in the freedom that we were on that front lawn\nPublicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House team I was trying to get through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo um\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move and this could did this will mean that the D. O. J. now has the ability\nTo pull records you know they they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweating egg and other people but you know this ... you want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're going to sign\nRidiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing\nIf they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her July they must both be criminally prosecuted\nThe law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room\nFor interpretation here if they can prove it now there is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague with a statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't\nBut then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fixed but an obvious fix that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention\nOkay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now\nBut if they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what if then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie about what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer the consequences because they're doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life that must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina\nThat Duke lacrosse team rape curves complete fabrication a total lie which you find a guy was raping her who was miles away and an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... and he should have gone to prison for a long time but that just to support him\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend seven to death later on\nMaybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process but\nIf we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system if we care about due process and the right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed at the political whims of the left for their convenience\nThan people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick and scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know it now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet\nIs it clear to me that sweating as a liar absolutely absolutely I as I did I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone spiked punch at a party which what what was that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch\nHow would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's going to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking a drink spiking an entire punishable determine drink yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she'd deranged I mean\nAnd that's where they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie\nThe story will be she's not a sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was of sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coffin she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nThat either has meaning or does it so I Hope Grassley pushes this and the DEA OJ needs to investigate this\nAnd we'll see how far they're able to be able to take it I think that this could end\nVery very poorly

way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't even have to but\n\nIt's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American immigrants at the border would would ah would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central American but now that's changed because of this asylum claim situation and as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced a border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nProcess that they are from Honduras um they are going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured the United states and as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I'm not going to have a bucket or whatever\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum in that needed to change the asylum process so that you apply in your in your country or in the nearest country you can get you\nOut of a U.S embassy and there's a process as it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but uh as important that there's something called a safe third party say third country agreement\nIs while I can tell you things on the show that you want to hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that his time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government a government level with Mexico\nBut what it would mean is that we would set up\nAt the border but on the Mexican side of the border and we yes we would probably have to pay for this and I was a book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it we would set up\nA centrally trailers you know a holding facility Sunday is not attention facility but it's a\nWhat would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation or it would be a place where people you know they have uh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the board\nAnd we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry courts\nSo you would start you would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their education process so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border\nWhich means that they don't or that they're not able to just go further and further in the interior United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what\nThey they get to stay in Mexico\nOr or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin of it that way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand as they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally\nSo then they are in the U.S illegally but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants\nGo into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked to senior immigrations officials about this is talk of lawyers about this that's how this works\nSo we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand that gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border\nThis is going to be they're going to keep doing this they're going to keep doing this it's the best most effective way to get around the legal
