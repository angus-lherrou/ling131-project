through these metal detectors\nAll right so that's one place where people get together and other places a church could you imagine what it would be like to\nGo to church and go through a metal detector to go to church or by the way there's got to be a metal detector there better be somebody there with a gun at the metal detector otherwise it's not really useful at all is it\nWell that's exactly right and the one fella pointed out if that happens I won't be going on there [noise] [noise]\n[noise] but that's what ...\nWhat is it that that people will give me some answers of how to make

three to five five let's go out to eat and so it was great named Vicky welcome you were John Caldera\nAm I bet you are on\nHigh John I just want to share with you I'm a church I go to a reasonably large church and members of the congregation I'm Kerry and then we also have staff who patrol the ground and the interior of the church\nWhen you say each each when\nWhen you say you have members who carry are you telling me that uh this is part of an organized effort that does at least some bit of training or at least I'm\nAll right Bob I Want you to be on the left side of the church and Hank will be on the right side of the church for most masses is it that kind of thing or is it just like your brain surgeon you're gonna bring your going okay ... how how detailed is it\nUm I don't think it's a hey you bring your offering like on um these are people who have concealed carry permit so they are trained we also have law enforcement officers to attend our church and then there are staff are trained who um just quietly patrol the church in the parking lot\nAnd do most people don't know what I'm most familiar or attending no they would not know that is correct why why not\n[noise] um it's just sort of low key we want to be conscious of safety in our church and um you know just keep the the members of the conversation at our church safe so it's not a big deal\nWhat you want to keep them safe but we do ... let me see if I understand that as you want to keep them safe but ignorance that there are people there with guns that are are are there by um by plan\nNot necessarily ignorance oh we're pretty tight knit group\nOver your tightened it grew shouldn't shouldn't people shouldn't people know who's who's carrying and not\n[noise]\nI'm ... and other words why not go up there and say hey parishioners\nGiven what's happened and other churches Texas what happened to synagogue you should know that we have people here who are concealed weapon holders who have volunteered to be part of our security detail in fact if you want more information to be part of it comes after after the service\nBut you ought to know that thank God we got concealed weapons here are and we're going to protect you from that'd be a nice thing for them to to hear\n[noise] um I think mostly they know that I think most\nWhat how do you know they don't\nGo there and you know because like I said most of the people have heard of that church\nUm have been there for many years so they sort of what's happening [noise] um I can go and I I have my conceal carry permit and if I Choose to I can take my hand I don't necessarily tell anybody that why would I that's why I don't carry\nAnswer that question is why would you is to let people know that when you come here we are trying to keep you safe and also\nGuns are good in the hands of good people in in this church the guns are in the hands of good people in case a bad person comes credit thing for them to but I I guess what I'm saying I'm advocating that you advertise that to the people in your church\nSo that they know it and and\nAnd hopefully I'm I'm I'm pushing a pro gun agenda maybe very up front on this\nI think it would be good for them to do\nWell again I think most people who attend church do know that we have people who patrol the ground it would only ... who is now\nUm who\nYou know comes there and it may not be immediately or parents what's happening but\nBut I I get the feeling like you don't want them that it's kind of this insight that I'd rather make it\nI'd rather make it\nVery obvious and here's why because then people go oh my God that's crazy and some people go oh no that's good and before you know it having the conversation of are there people concealing guns in my church is that real or not and it makes it more acceptable and easier for other churches\nWere not as advanced and open to the idea as yours\n[noise] no I agree with that\nI Would um I guess I'm saying you're you're being evangelical about your God be evangelical about your gun rights as well and this is an incredible opportunity to do just that\nI agree with you that's a good idea\nThere you go see all come in your view on I'll I'll I'll come in and give the sermon someday big effects for the call I really appreciate it let's see if we can squeeze jak in here jak we've only got a less than a minute so it's all you\nAre jak welcome\nJak going once jak going choice oh hello hello yes I can\nI say you got pretty much it was my point them that a lot of conversation I'm I'm very much pro people milling about in their church have a group of other parishioners and there were people you're putting your faith and to protect you don't even atrophy\n[noise] um I Would advocate more on the side of you know part of maybe after the sermon that group of people stay behind and practices you know this you know this way\nOr the cafeteria will be closed after today's service we're having target practice\n\nA live live round firing I like that idea\nYeah maybe that I mean he certainly you know because you know in the event or something like this you know the goes from zero to a hundred miles an hour very

are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nRather than fighting back\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy ... ended for so long back fully funds President Trump's border wall expands caseload people lives in Brooklyn or legal immigrant and insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump\nThat's conservative I was like Kevin McCarthy\nAlso ... I feel like that's how I mean for the wall I had to tell us when we're likely ... way no one wanted\nThat any of us would do anything in our power to prevent this kind of a master from happening to help anyone who was caught in such a horrific circumstances and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer\nAnd uh and words of support and everything else that we can do\nFor the Jewish community in this country\nAnd yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without\nA moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than\nThey make this about Trump\nThese people who do this every day on every issue at all times are are sick they have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective last week we were told\nThat there was a bomber who Trump is responsible for it because this guy would already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run and that a a a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticizes people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted they can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals but\nSay that Trump is basically responsible did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't pack the bombs himself you know Trump wasn't wasn't crushing a glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that stupid\nBut they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way and what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say are covered in Trump's stickers covered in all this pro markup paraphernalia\nAnd so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now\nWell here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and chew favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt's still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump is just raised hate in America let's be clear that that means that now Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges in a hate crime against anyone else you know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country let's say you know\n... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremists let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here\nAnd I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's wall because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because he has implicitly encourage them they'll say if a anti Semite who is anti Trump\nYou know you get on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\n\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there's violence and bloodshed here in America and there's\nThere's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness at it's at the root of it all eat is Trump's fault they say this is delusional\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time\nIn ways that I Can't even begin to fathom\nI I'm I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live eat and brief politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like\nWhat are they what it will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even me who are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions vicious how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric\nWhile saying the rest of rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate\nIn this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents\nLet them beats you into submission bludgeon\nYou into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is nothing to\nDo with it they're calling President Trump and some of them and President Trump grew up in New York City he's ... as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Crump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish his son in law's Jewish market converted to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti\nSemite not even a little bit not even close but they say this\nThe media says they pat themselves on the back oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know you're a bunch of destructive little individuals that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hates the president who justify this his position for Jews decides\nTo be violent engages in this in this replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy\nTrying to track attach Trump to this though it's just show intellectually dishonest each show unfair and\nIt just goes to show you that there's there's no effort in good faith there is no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for it let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault by the press drives I I agree with\nTrump and that the press does drive a lot of this because the press is full of a bunch of preening self obsessed self righteous jerks\nNot all of them obviously and I know is ... I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good people\nThey're not honest or not ethical it's all about the self it's all about the agenda they are activists posing as truth tellers eighties destroying this country from the inside they are the ones undermining institutions they're the ones undermining public trust\nAnd they turn around and accused everybody else it exactly that they tell you that Trump won't take responsibility they take responsibility for nothing\nWrong story after wrong story all critical of Trump oh that's just a coincidence as if we're idiots we're really supposed to believe that yeah sure it's just a coincidence\n\nThey are disgraceful and they're tearing this country apart and I have to say that it's very frustrating as well because if the if we were able to focus on what's really happening in America and the than the direction of the country right now and how we're all doing\nThis country is doing very well this country is on the right path\nBut the left can't make a fair argument about why it's not so what do they do they make it about a motion to make it about anger and viciousness and destructive\nPolitics and lots and that's what they're doing that's where the number the president\nUm we're gonna continue to see this unfortunate where we're going to talk about the caravan coming up some big updates on that for\nYou as well as um some more following the last week with a bomber and and we we got a whole bunch of show planting so stay right there I'll be right back on the radio\n[noise]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk you're being tracked\nOn line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider that's why I just wanted to take back my privacy by using express VPN expressed VPN has\nEasy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phones and tablets\nTurning on express VPN protection only takes one click expressed BBN secures and ...

whatsoever that they will extend to him an angel supporters to all of us remember it's\nNot just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this\nEvening hatred of the Trump voter to oh that's a part of the anti Trump movement they despise the butter they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining were good with it were like yeah I like Trump I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us\nBecause of all that and that's why they feel completely justified in saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the differences it was always on the fringe in the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated that\nUh what's happened and what's so extremely dangerous about this issue now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories edited is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that you can go on TV that that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago ... well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump has called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate and he said this many many times and they'll say well the wind is from talk about white nationalist\nSo much you can't with folks you you know there's nothing he can do that will make them stop calling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend\nThe most basic level of good faith do them in any of these discussions and and they love to try out these these fake conservatives in these fake Republicans like Jennifer Rubin who is that she is the queen of fake Republicans washing post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing\nBut you know she she blames Trump not just for\nWhat happened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like before\nI got a ... gallon ... faith that we've had at fifty seven percent tax and the last year and anti snack hate crimes\nI Would say to them you are the ones who are out of step with our society [noise]\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of the dream that is America [noise] and this country because of what it stands for will not stand for your comment to [noise]\nThe greatest president in my lifetime\nWith the possible exception of Donald Trump\nWill see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tougher record to compare against\nBut Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for your just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system\nOur principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty\nThat's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that's where all stars and so\nTrue anti Semitism Andrew raises when I say that with the qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some of the calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political ...\nTrue anti Semitism and racism and uh and and and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with an ailing noble rights and if we're not all equal\nIn the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really as conservatism edit conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that\nThat they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth\nAs human beings and as citizens of this great nation so when the last\nTry so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way or they conservative though\nYou know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave as elites and separate\nFrom the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us we are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all\nHuman beings in this struggle together and help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life\nAnd that has an obligation on all of us um when when they try to make this case that racism and anti Semitism in these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I\nHave a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that\nBecause it's show on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nA it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really\nBelieve and I know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that\nAnd you and I said you knowing that that is a lie that's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender\n\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender and these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats do get show there I said triggered when they just\nBrought up that they are the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how do the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage directed that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democrat Party\nThere's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and natural law that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers status at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society\nTo promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just it is the ... opposite of a true conservative to believe that first in less than because their skin color is a person is less than his agenda [noise] less than because of religious [noise] that it's not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you know that and I know that that I Do think\nThat is worth sometimes taking a step back and just [noise]\n... exactly why that is the [noise]\nA lot of fakes in frauds out there and a lot

I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the left just dismiss this out of hand was\nYes well it gets dismissed for civil or is it just because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make cards everywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place that the target or potential target\nAs an armed guard at ... that's called security that's the norm that's the real world but\nEven bringing up an actual solution is the horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every ...\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place really speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting that Sarah Oh it depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know not ever arms or you know I don't know of another congregants I shouldn't say river arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you uh did that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological out of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd that's that's either a law abiding gun order showing their side arm war is trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement the last off it ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basic few bucks because you were you you acknowledge the way the world really is but I I one thing I have come to grips with it\nHow frightening guns of those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it and honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nAnd then I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just a Texan but also were a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there\nBut you know you you look at at the the cultural differences in the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp as an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts\nSounding but it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have similarities with guns all that's a big part of it they've also been raised to think or they they've been led to believe by their peers in those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states are always a bad and also by the way Jessie the people who are part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and\nKids are not they've both shot fires before real gun not just Bebe gun shot guns they're familiar with them they have had gun safety drawing they know where the weapons are in our whole they know they're never allowed to touch them and last time around that light and guess what\nThey're safe with them but you but as you mentioned a cultural issue and I understand having lived in the northeast I've lived all over\nHow people view it differently\nBut here in Texas and other places that I've lived it is the norm for people to carry in church I put up with the other day I think you are in saying if you were a license\nTo do so to not have your weapon on you in a place of worship you have mass amounts of people that are prime targets for evil sitting there with their back to the door stop\nLiving in this rosy world of make believe and acknowledge the world as it is sick monsters like this come back is not the last one on earth I promise you so you you carry in church\nAbsolutely I I carrying church everything was real if your city but in church a hundred percent of the time I'm Jerry loaded on my ...\nAnd they just it's really you would love this we have these things called now this is not a church I go to we have these cowboy church where people will just show up in boots and gee they ride horses to church\nIt will open to carry firearms in church the one my buddy goes to he has a Copenhagen in his lip as ...\nNow you can make fun of that if people will is so absurd redneck caricature but the bottom line ... nobody's shoot Netflix up\nI Would think so I think that I think it's a fair point so I just again a if we're going to talk about solutions real solution should be treated at least or at least real\nOr you know attempts at risk mitigation I mean solution might be due strong words at least be taken all really just a cultural a cultural divide issue for them and and the virtues signal have guns bad and people with guns but this is what I was they ... the lea left opposes firearms it really is a\nDividing line between the kind of people that the ... lights and the kind of people the left doesn't mean guns are right up there with being pro choice or pro life in terms of what separates out the two sides of America now\nYou're right you're right and when it comes to guns all these gun grabbing left to start coming for them after a mass shooting if the ... the problem where is the mass shooting at the gun show\nIn American history there are guns everywhere everyone as though on their hips there on the counters everybody's buying them everybody selling 'em there's germs and your problem why his they're not going to mass shooting in show\nYeah and and why are there are so many mass shootings in so called gun free zones as you know but people don't want to learn this lesson on the the problem as as an issue of fact they want to deal with it emotionally
