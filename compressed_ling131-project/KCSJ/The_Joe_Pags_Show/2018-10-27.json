Trump has said about Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Eric Holder and John Brennan and CNN and the thinking of the purse they sent those pipe bombs is foolhardy this is someone who has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list\nNotice are we switch there and that little montage replayed it starts off with very prominent famous anti Trump Democrats saying all manner of you know nasty Vineland\nGag richer story is that a word I think it's a word degrading I think I think I might have just made up degrow story is that I did I just make up a word or derogatory\nDegree tore oh yeah yeah I did\nI just made up a word um yeah I just made up word on live\nRadio that's interesting you know we'll go with it derogatory was what I was looking [laughter] but but that great story sounds doesn't that although you know it kinda sounded like a word I kind of made up my word there for a second uh folks been a long way\n[laughter] you go but I you know that's when you know you're a real baller like Bush when when Bush said Mr underestimated I knew exactly what he meant you know and that's no word when he called himself the decider\nThat wasn't technically a word either but it might as well up in a word and now it is a word I think it's great you know who's the decider was the old who's the person who makes the decisions I don't know the decider\nUh anyway so I made up or the let's get back to the substance or so they they are all saying these things about Trump very nasty things very um two rockets or a things and then they all immediately jumped you it's Trump's fault it's Trump's fault but there's clearly disturbed very\nYes dangerous and and and evil but added pathetic human being a decided to send these these homemade there were pipe bombs and they were they were alive bombs I mean they could have gone off at this guy I knew what he was doing thank God they did not um but\nThere's really no principle that the left is using your determine you know what is acceptable what is acceptable political speech and what does incitement it's just what is your side do that's bad what is my side do that's okay and that's really the primary separation\nThere's really not a lot to separate things beyond that there's not much that you can point you were you'd say you know oh I see that there is some establishment of an actual baseline of of how we can adjudicate these things no no no it's just my side good your side bad\nAnd we know that this was going to happen\nOr it's just it's just very it's frustrating to see this um because it is so it is so obvious it is so clear oh\nGovernor Cuomo also wants to work in all the bombs let me first start that a bomb is a combustible device with explosive material that can be dangerous place Thirteen\n[noise]\n\nYour\nI think the president of the United states should take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're saying\nFor the first time in different ways I think the president of the United states has been dog whistles to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there and I think that they are\nBut they believe the president wants them to do it as oh way really does do a lot of promote violence now they're trying to turn it on a course or would they would like to intimidate us and of\nCourse we must be a wisely must be foolish and how can a polish ways\nBut we never saw the show ended up by the justice and equality in this country\nMaxine Waters very foolish and you know we we just gave you there on the one hand she's calling for essentially rabble rousing she wants people to get up and faces she wants to you know yell and scream and be nasty and mean and you know don't don't give them a moment's peace and then she's you know saying that\nTrump is the one who is is inciting violence Trump is the one who is causing a causing problems and this is why I I knew this was going to be the case all week uh assuming that we got to where we are now are we know that this guy is a wacko and\nIs going to be the right is going to be saddled with this with this complete you know look\nHe's a dangerous he's a dangerous maniac so he's got to spend the rest of his life in prison and he needs to do there need to be serious consequences for this well you know that this guy is also I mean each it there's something sad about someone who\nIs show show deranged empathetic and an evil\nAnd just the whole thing I mean he's a really pathetic human being um but ... now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters are this guy is representative of a broader sense but on the right meanwhile\nDo we have a country of three hundred and twenty million people\nAnd now I can think of er there's one there's one person that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who since Trump has been president\nPeople would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his uh what he views as his politics um but now that they're going to make this you're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go where they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties and things like Nineteen Ninety three\nYou'll still hear about bombing abortion clinics hasn't happened and you know a very long time but that's anytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get into this whole discussion and\nI wanted to discuss this with the young Turks guy who was on my show and rising morning with junk we're never going to hear again you watch next week there'll be this oh right wing terrorism is really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with\nAnd I always have to point out well the big issue there is one do you exclude nine eleven from it\nAh that's first and foremost but then also there's a whole bunch of other things like how do you really count this what is the determining factor whether something is counted as terrorism because with some of the federal statistics that they look out for this they'll say well\nYou know neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ... well if the guy was a minority those stairs now is that a hate crime is murder yes\nIs it terrorism though in the way we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit a little bit less ... less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism uh and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion and from\nThe statistics forwarded attacked him in the moment that you start looking at worded attacks than you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threat that we\nKnow you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them will tell them I mean these are attacks would have killed hundreds of people most of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most of the right wing terrorists may site is single acts of violence against individuals by\nA neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again heinous evil\nOr crimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not a strategic level national threat terrorism the way that radical Islamic terrorism is but I'm just telling you you're going to now that we've got this guy who's been captured today\nThis is a says our fellow says are uh say rock whatsoever keep forgetting is how the same last name and I never remember his first name but not not studied everyone's saying uh everyone's saying that\nYou know he's obviously so pro Trump ... such a bad guy said or say ... say opposites Iraq say are\nOr what is a we know what is\nIt is not I mean these American but what what's his his parents nationality or his parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any me his first name says are the kind of unusual anyway [noise] ah\nYeah they're ... they're going to run with this though and this is where we have to deal with now this was not going away anytime soon it's ah unfortunately going to be used against us and I don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that it doesn't I Hope that people can see that this is just one deranged maniac but\n... you're gonna see flood zone coverage of this issue for the next\nSolid\nWeek and change because they want this to be first and foremost on the minds of as many voters as possible and and\nThey're going to be they're going to be really pushing this and they really want people to think that this is\nThis is what will need to be on the lookout for the real concern is right wing terrorism when\nThere's going to be crazy people of all kinds from all places but they're yeah [noise]\nHere's a tweet from President Trump quote Twitter has removed many people from my count and more

very much about the redistribution of wealth\nAnd I think it's show noteworthy that President Obama who himself\nHe's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful that's where he knows that's a sweet spot

their own money\nTo the government there being greedy\n... this is a a at a central talking point on the left you'll you'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires okay well they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of taxes overall I mean are the top one percent pays I think thirty percent of all federal income taxes\nSo there we already have a very\nProgressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to you wherever it is wherever it is every speech she gives same basic theme\nThere are the other guys don't want the government to have more control over lives and take more of their stuff because they don't want you to have more

are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is\nYou know they never really addressed is why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrities are going to listen to these are people that have amassed\nIncredible fortunes all Democrats why are they all Democrats you know what what I find to be the case is that people people that have had to work incredibly hard and overcome tremendous struggle to make their money\nUh

Seventeen [laughter]\nWe're\nFor fake bank [noise]\nFinancial crisis in our life [noise] and Democrats [noise]\nWell why did it start with Obama how how about\nWe've had even we had an even bigger\nFinancial pull back with the great depression and we recovered from that and ... and enter period of huge economic growth and a boom I mean Obama really at what point does he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years in the Trump presidency we're still hearing about\nHow about ... remind her by the way Obama never achieved or three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never\nOnly president in history\nFor whom that's the case\nSo when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous\nThat what he's saying is is transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the government\nWas the problem with what happened in the great recession and liberals don't ever talk about this you know when he says agree banks and all this stuff that's what happened no it would really happen was a liberal said that banks to lend to people who can't pay it back\nBut if you can't pay it back and you happen to be non privileged and particularly the fall into certain minority categories then banks has to lend you even though you're bad you're a bad bet for a loan\nAnd you do that enough and the federal government backstop those loans and says well we'll we'll pay if these people to fall we we've got you got you covered Wall Street and Wall Street does what it does\nThat's what really happened I mean you know one question Obama should be forced to ask or be forced to answer rather by someone in the media would be what exactly did you do that was so great for the economy\nWhat exactly does does he think\nGot and it was just got to grow the economy go go go gotta going how what what exactly did he do\nAnd I think the truth is it's very clear he he has absolutely no answer that I mean the stimulus was was atrocious as soon as was a huge waste of money and that was money that was put on the tab for future generations to pay so what ...\nWhat did Obama bring to the table when it came to

traumatic stress syndrome to a clinically significant level\nA clinically sniffing level so you know this this is what I Would say goes into the pile of evidence that I'm building up maybe we'll have to do a book or a product on this about how the left really has lost his mind I don't mean that as in\nI'm I'm trying to be funny about them or I'm I'm doing the usual thing that people do on radio or uh in in political media which is\nYou know you exaggerate to get attention no no I I mean that there are a lot of people on the left who have had a real clinically um possible to evaluate nervous breakdown that they have lost it I mean they have lost it in a profound way a and\nThis is this is telling us that that's exactly what happened you know I always try to tell folks ...\n... you know what my my main thing with with the liberals that I Know my liberal friends is when I when they asked me they say oh I don't understand how you don't know the countries in so much trouble or institutions they got all all\nBummed out about all this stuff really just you know Trump is destroying America and they they cry about it and they get really upset\nOr or them we'll hope they don't actually cry but they they want about it I Try to tell them you know it really doesn't matter to you as much as you think it does these things that you keep talking about you know are fraying institutions it's not going to affect your job is not gonna affect your home it doesn't affect\nAnything that you think it especially when you're talking about stuff like Russia collusion and but I I really do believe that there is a\nA big part of the general population that likes the anxiety of catastrophe that they like to\nCling to this notion that oh my gosh like this terrible things going to happen and I'm not saying there aren't real\nConcerns that we should all have you know first and foremost among them is you know we're all gonna die that's the truth that we have to deal with right there there are some real things out there to be worried about 'em you know we are probably going to explode our currency at some point and you know the our currency has a\nHas an incredible track record historically of always always leading to financial disaster as it has never been avoided currency leads to financial disaster there is a hundred percent\nA track record of this so you know that's a real concern\nA disease that is in terrible because of all the antibiotics you know especially antibiotic resistant bacteria in a mass infection or map mass\nViral play things like that that's real concern and day to day concerns are very real you know how you get along with your friends and family and how you doing the work but the concerns that liberals obsess over or delusions\nOr this notion that the planet is going to die and I mean that quite literally the entire planet will die unless we start making insignificant modifications do our day to day lives are with regard to shield to admissions that's crazy\nThat it's not based in any reality that's not a normal thing to be worried about but it's not a normal thing to think that just bonkers\nAnd when you start to look at the other things that get liberals really upset and Russia collusion and election security and all that uh they they are worried about things for the sake of worrying and many cases but the problem is they believe that they don't know that they're doing then\nSpeaking of a of of uh you know very real pie DSD uh I saw you know in in one of the opening sequences of picky blinders which is an

argue with you\nOn line five Ninety\nRadio ... euro Fox News multiple fatalities after man opens fire at a synagogue and Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood\nHad happened during a baby naming ceremony a gun and reportedly shouting all Jews must die before opening fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood went to his ... director of the Pittsburgh department of public safety\nThe are ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting that it's still McGrath bomber the make America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case will you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter as a congressional baseball game the senior shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nAlso was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American\nName is Caesar says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always though quick\nTo say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of him in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just to picture the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a band that looked like that and nobody suspected or even years ago where they are a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs\nTo people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual sent into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this because there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that in fact\nI can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for putting that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example every example example of that\nWith the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be under the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nBetsy responsible or by the way the the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or an American Indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for shipping veils\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not go there observing and tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming

County Arizona he is a right there on separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border\nAnd deals with the illegal immigration overtime I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way and and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to her has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate you how're you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nIllicit always appreciate it really had a good time with you at the fair and get together in Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six one I could do for his standing next to you but ah it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw out they're interacting with the people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nWho walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't think I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to do I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his what ... is going on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect that we've tried to go from there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that humans can attract more flies and then you can then ...\nAnd in watching you in Iraq that again is sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand that you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those things\nAre just difficult to deal yeah and that you know I'm a I'm a believer in calmness in power if you walk up your calm and they can feel that they don't feel you're amped up it just it really helps that situation go a lot smoother image you have to rest\nAnd ended up going to last forever but there's some people that have just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching your chair of mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like like pd and others um it is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight that you know it's kind of it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and it we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\n[laughter] just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm which work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discussion but you're right and if we wanted to we can stack honest on charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nBut you're from law enforcement guy and I say that\nI guess it's a compliment but it's also your job I've got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am a where the where the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws owing force these laws you seem to be a guy that says no here's the book this is where the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them\nWhat reaction do you get from people in our county the residents there last question marketing appreciate the time or what reaction do you get from them when you say if and when they get here and we're going to make sure that we we you know stick to the laws are in ... is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands the majority of the people understand the immigration issue where with\nCars running from us almost ... almost every night were given the drugs coming into our community are you being affected by heroin and by a by ... by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public in our youth hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county we get for the most part you know and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect to be I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we had a lot of support from are from the people in town\nOr good is if they sound like very good people and they certainly have a great share

guy working on tax code words ... playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what is this new tax cut plans we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get it to the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to knock today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI\nShows was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you from yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously these guys had a history of uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening\nTo

rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and you know I I took a Ari Fleischer his advice early on and said you know similar stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and now to this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him the demography bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber ... new people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nSeemed a shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is a Joe I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or after it took a swing ... do you want to take some ground second I looked out\nThe was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just well a foreign minister the head of the shootings so uh this is a media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll be blamed president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric\nThey often um are filing when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder a media analyst\nYou've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to blame the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished\nTo what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that thirty five forty years later the media looks back on a regular ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that are ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity\nAnd rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or it'd be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I only have two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American who pays taxes got a break\nEvery American who pays taxes has a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising yes to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success says\nThat we got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and and in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the

that for you to write none of the phone lines ... welcome to align one each Lisa in California I Lisa\nHi how are you living the dream which I Would have\nBeen calling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about um went shooting how how do you get that\nCircuit typically forget I mean go there a whole nother story in movie theaters and other other churches ... how would you get your\nHey I can sort out the bad guys again the good guys and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you know I certainly when I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility\nRight not only protect myself but\nAnybody that might that might come under attack\nAgainst the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry at churches but that that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas do allow to in many places but at the same time there are also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my gun in\nAnd you should but if you're not going to allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you weren't to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado\nThat guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns\nBut once the interview tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo we are I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't\nOr they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance an exit\nThis way anybody getting an are getting out or anybody get a good mood can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility\nAnd they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they can pull the trigger one gun\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it at Disneyland they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so the people that\nWe pay to be our legislators or representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House you can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously that economic a\nFull body for example or even a metal on you know those are those are the item that it's not just a that have an accent the people around them and in a church probably qualified people that are\nGoing to be there any way to get out that kind of thing but then there's\nTraining in right now I just\nFeel like it like I said it's not just I don't disagree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost ten more ... think that it's not a realistic I yeah\nWell I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by guys like you and me congregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like that also you you just have a bus system where you have to be opposed to the to be let it I think that ended up itself could save some lives\nWithout a doubt it's a one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... when we come back [noise]\n\nOn

unfortunately in the state and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president on their loyalty to the president\nYou know I did some a media this morning I was on CNN and trust them when I said that I called the president a liar not what I said the president is telling the it's like that and he's covering the truth\nIs doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've done work at CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean when you walk and it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there is a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you were to get you know some some left hooks for now\nHard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think that we're really hitting these that horror this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figured that could kill me with the base but let's find people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago I was it loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now or I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger you know his father's obviously now deceased but I'm going back\nInto the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in\nWhat they were like so this was a real fun book to write a von ... call yesterday or she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said\nIt was great and she couldn't wait to show it to her father encouraged when one of his best friend said the same thing you know could listen I\nI I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... short for packing we will so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so it was the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite\nMedia in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they sent it there's micro aggressions pregnant president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you\nAre and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they are offended by right\nThere was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a\nStradivarius that he does a ... and\nThat's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and by the way I don't mean anything by it I'm ... my personality\nI agree it's embodies or move to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now go and get this great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president were you a surprise I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there's a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so we kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looks for a cost to now and tries to tell me your fake news\nThan it is an enemy turn in a cost to eats it up he does it every time you make fools himself when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but again I bought but it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in that job did you think that the media would work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what Adam ...\nAnd the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe ... era as a press secretary I did the first press conference and I told her that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the ... plant\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context of\nEvil as being very of Secret Service and flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah trail me around I was like well I'm not the bad and I'm not their self promoting myself run I use of expletives which I obviously regret\nShe loved that got it changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nIn you know exaggerated article and then he really ... you know four or five days later ... and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to the ambush in to see if we can get him out of the White House ... and you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so what's\nThe other one I thought so if you went back to the right but\nIf you went and checked out the pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... who's going to be very direct you're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered\nInto a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like you wouldn't want to do we want to trust people\nThe age Joe I made a mistake it's dishes vibrant place down the area I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street ... Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me uh a lot of my book is also about that well that you know where I got up\nDusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial comes with a car crash right ... and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because we never want to do is be on your back for too long or you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it you know as I did writing it because it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a ... and the name of the book is the blue collar president I originally go ... go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the blue collar president a last question and I think people are dying to know descent but what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say is good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the part of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him yeah\nI had a very good conversation with them last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the F G we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similarly I'm and I'm not sure damn I Hope he's not sort of me for what happened\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the book guys like ... I see myself a day wasn't fired Korea was fired I was fired I call this S P L Z\nWere fired but loyal [laughter] so you know I I feel very good about the president is that the one of the toughest jobs in the world you I certainly didn't want to make it harder for him I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help until I Do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of op eds warm state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president it seems to be ... you know some of that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out and it's a you know here just Fifteen months later and you're still world for the president whereas I'm Rochelle was out for Fifteen seconds and had a new book\nSo uh I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you could look at me look at my listeners I mean look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake\nI should have bought the ... better and I really think I could've been ineffective guy I agree with everything but you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids that be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last thing which I think you would appreciate grown up the way you did and I hope your listeners that you know whining and sports of politics Joe\n... facts are going to win in five on a story to tell you the machine\nWhile I Am I'm a big Yankee fan obviously but but if it's going to be the ... anybody should be the red Sox 'cause it'd be the edges\nOf just like you know like a machine that they were like last night so to me no whining and spores and ...

you every single time it is your boy Joe packs a note about ... before I go to John I Bush\nA couple of things are important number one when you go do a radio show or you can both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation but I Want to comment on it you got to stop for a second and then I'll let you can to you but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she felt that she would win if she kept talking unfortunately for you I have\nThe microphone and I have control\nOf of what's being heard at any given time I know I have a decision to make either both of us speak at the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue but it's going to make allegation of drug allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true\nIn fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... it was one of my focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people are very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very\nLoud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides they are very fine people on both sides\nThat it'd be we're talking about is whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate a war heroes of soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments cause they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of Jared Jared down sure or they're bad people in that side absolutely so he's been he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listening to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled a reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have\nWell fortune where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms worry I guess I don't know what the ... went to ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this and when he talks as have stay like that that he doesn't have the full mobility over his hands in his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president went through I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said oh look at me any sort of been his hands with a similar fashion and made you know spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good of you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before you even consider running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when reporters didn't do the report until two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a door that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me and double trouble um stupid or something you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're gonna do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and we're not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker what's fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide to know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact to do more than I Do but you failed at any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces\nI gave you a straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work so bring it next time beginning of July but you better bring it better than that All right what do you get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate jour yet\nI'm just great to be with\nYou have really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention or it appears to be a plaintiff some short in some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen and Jen is one of the famous
