{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "You're doing this for ... yes yes so we were when you do um you've got is is a problem for me to ask you go to you got to pull the field right now\nIt's not right now it's going to be going in if he was\nGoing to in the field that will be like how long will it take you from the time you get all the responses back well your calculator\nSure it's we always try to a minimum of five hundred survey for a statewide poll of likely voters or we might up at a little bit will usually do that over two or three nights of dialing so I'm either going to a few hundred and fifty interviews each night for 'em and it will spill over maybe do a little bit on Wednesday night\nCalling center time right now is you can imagine Israel super tight rope and so ah the polling center going with on this when we use several uh we're gonna be dialing Monday Tuesday Wednesday\nOrder for the benefit of those the here are pulling five hundred people yeah I Will always pick your damn to you right now I can find an email or or somewhere where the chat rooms where people were saying how can you extrapolate anything just talking to five hundred people that's right\nThat's right no it's a common criticism I'm an IRS but there's there's scientific method there is a scientific method to it we we equate it to a bowl of soup do you need to drink an entire bowl of soup to know what it tastes like rather than one spoonful um\nIf\nYou ... you know in measuring a you know in in measuring speech well it's just it's simply as saying hey if it didn't work we wouldn't be doing to you know like turnout is going to be anywhere between two point three million to perhaps as high as two point six million this November\nUm how can five hundred ... you know interviews really be reflective what you really need to how to do is make sure that your sample is reflective of the demographics of turnout right 'cause like when I Do my poll it's not fifty percent Republicans interviewed and a twenty five percent Democrats would if ... percent Republicans do I did that\nIt would completely skew towards Republican opinions so you need it set that up by gender age range a party so it's not too old versus not too young ... I'm ... and those approaches typically as long as you've randomized your sample and it's not self selecting the participants\nWill give you a pretty good measurement if you know what you're doing of perhaps a where the election may come out there's all kinds of other hurdles a but\nAt this day and age is getting more and more difficult to measure voter opinion accurately in a horse race but so far so good\nSo over over the course of your years of doing this how has your from mobile phone calls to weigh on blowing cold if you see your point we're actually land like cold will be just like you're very demented was\nAbsolutely I refused to do a landline only survey you can't among likely general election voters it works for a Republican primary survey though however because fifty percent of a Republican primary voting University of sixty five an older the why\nHaven't we you've ... you've thrown at at least a dozen times tonight right you've got to fix that yes we do um I don't know how we you and I might\nJust to try to get rats are few younger folks to participate let alone you know like I'm going to get his Republican a chance to look Democrat primary voters are a little bit different sixty percent of female forty percent male consistently um but it's older to it I don't think that like oh you know\nFinish your point about the other really good to be that much younger group\nYes absolutely up but the bottom line is is a you know you just need to make sure that you're forecasting it properly and doing it right but land line back in two thousand ten you could get away with a landline only survey day\nI Would refuse to do a survey where my sample is any less than thirty percent cell phones Seventy percent landline sets the threshold because you have to understand the cell phone interview could be twenty two dollars per interview but the landline interview costs us only twelve dollars the reason being this goal yes like a cell phone number is much more expensive\nSo like we were hoping to do a survey of the candidates for Denver mayor next year road okay but the population of Denver it'd be more my minority and overwhelmingly cell phone you need to be Seventy Seventy percent cell phone\nIt could cost me eight to ten thousand more dollars rather than trying to attempt to do no landline because the call center if you think about it they charge me by the number of times in the interview has to call the number and to do a land line where you know you're going to be at home you do seven numbers and then you get somebody on the line and then you complete an interview\nCell phone if I'm calling you right now no way I'm calling you however if you're not in a place where you can speak confidently and consistently you're not going to be able to complete so cost them a lot more and they need more cause like I'm going to have\nProbably forty people calling on Monday so I mean you're probably\nArgument this real fast yes your typical civil guard up my thought is well how many calls you for being with us [noise] twenty five thousand unique phone numbers for me to complete roughly five hundred interviews holy\nThat's the drop off

control today but the problem is a lot of it exists in a gray area we need to work with the oil and gas industry local government environmental groups to foreign allies that to provide more predictability and safety\nJust say we at a time honored tradition tradition here in Colorado of a one energy policy that every governor from Roy Romer on has endorsed and it's been a great spirit of Colorado collaboration where\nGovernors have worked in concert with the industry a governor Hickenlooper during his time uh worked on an extensive mapping plan with the industry after\nTragedy and suit or and and he recently came up with an orphan or a way to cap orphan wealth or all collaborations with the industry\nUh and I think you achieve more working together then combative Lee and I'm concerned that based on congressman pose as radical extreme past when it comes to energy policies that he would work compatible with an industry that provides two hundred and thirty thousand jobs and thirty two billion dollars of annual economic impact to our state\nThank you we want to go now to our election partners we have with us Dominic ... twelve might laugh at ... radio and John Franklin to Colorado signed each panelists delve into specific topics and Dominic we'll start with you\nThank you very much Sean candidates a first of all I Want to thank you both gentlemen for debating uh we were senior praises in Colorado and set out today that you're doing so many debates and I appreciate that uh let's get right to it with these questions I'll ask the author of up to forty five seconds for your response was Mr Stapleton we'll begin with you\nFor people in the metro area of growth has become a double edged sword a\nCost of living in is rising that urban quarter while wages leg what specifically will you do to reduce the cost of living in Colorado give Mr Stapleton floors yours\nGrowth means jobs and jobs means growth they are inextricably linked and that's why I've said\nThat my top priority will be the fix Colorado's crumbling infrastructure for the long term we put forward a plan to do it a new a bonding mechanisms from the general fund a which includes sports gambling fixing our broken a medical marijuana system also ah we've done an analysis of Colorado and eight other states are now in states and\nUh and found out that if we actually spent the same amount per mile on maintenance charges are that these other states did we could have more than a hundred and fifty million dollars for bonding in the future\nOr this is in contrast to congressman pulses radical plan\nWhich simply a wants to invest in multi mode of transportation\nUh underutilized public transportation and bike lanes at a time when we have to be spending all of our money on roads and bridges bridges and roads a plus he's going to drive so many jobs out of Colorado and bankrupt our economy that we're not going to have the tax basis or to fix our road so he will solve the problem and the people will be moving out of Colorado they just won't be moving back\nThank you Mr Paul is\nWell you know it seems like Everytime Walker talks it's noun verb German polish noun verb jerk pull us I'm here to tell you about my plans are and look a we have to invest in infrastructure because while the growth is very important we need to make sure that growth actually works to improve the quality of life for Colorado families because what is gross being what do we have a\nThree per se or three percent unemployment uh and it's very low but for many families they may have gotten a race but your rent is gone up more you're Fifteen minute commute is now thirty five minute commute young families struggle with the high cost of childcare and we're focused on making more preschool and kindergarten options available and saving families money on health care\nSo it's about how could we yes take this amazing economic growth engine and if somebody who's created hundreds of jobs who started companies whose met payroll I bring that real world practical experience for the governorship and I can make growth worked for every Colorado family\nMuch post we'll begin with you this question in a recent interview both of you said that you would welcome Amazon H cue to coming to Denver bringing it's fifty thousand employees under the right conditions though what would represent the right conditions for Amazon me welcome back to Colorado about them to call red rather Mr Paul is\nYou know that's a great example because it's everything about growth writ large right it's in one package of fifty thousand jobs and it's the same issues we deal with him five packages of ten thousand jobs so it's really a question of where and how\nWe do it right we can't take that anywhere without driving up the already high cost of housing without increasing traffic on our roads but if you look at the metropolitan area and you work with large employers to attract them help create competitive areas where you can people can get to work\nPeople can live for doubly these are real projects that I worked on just delivered in northern Colorado in Sonoma County we partnered with the commissioners to do a forty acres of land exchange lake hill to provide real affordable workforce housing for people so that people who\nWork in the community in Frisco and in Breckenridge can also afford to live in a community that's the kind of out of the box solution that I Would look forward to bringing the caller Colorado\nMr save them over to represent the right conditions\nThe right conditions would be a Colorado economy that puts Coloradans first\nAnd that solves our infrastructure problems for the long term because the fact of the matter is we're not going to be able to compete for Amazon's business or any other big fortune five hundred company with our crumbling infrastructure and so I'm all for fixing infrastructure not just on an incremental basis but all over the long term uh and we also need attainable housing\nFor young people that are moving here are more workforce housing and that is going to require a a strong Colorado economy it's why I was one of the earliest supporters of the president's tax plan to more than Seventy percent of Coloradans are benefiting from if you make\nSixty thousand dollars in Colorado your federal tax bill has gone from Seventeen hundred dollars to a hundred dollars this is another difference with congressman poses radical extreme agenda he actually entered legislation to repeal the president's tax cuts uh\nHe he is propose only cost a hundred billion dollars a spending a and nothing\nThat would actually be revenues that would help grow our economy and you just can't wrap up debt Jared you have to find a way to pay for it if we want to have the economic future our kids deserve and\nKind of water you're just propose racking up debt your infrastructure plan one oh nine would put the ... state in three billion dollars of debt without a dime a new revenue talking out of both sides that are not true at all actually what what do you know it isn't\nA gentleman let me have to uh uh for a follow up do either of you support any limitations on growth will start with you Mr ...\nIt's not a question of limitations has a question of baking it worked for those of us are already here right growth should benefits those of us who are already live in this day I was I was born in Colorado a we're raising our kids here are seven year old he just turned seven John or just the other day and our ... year old daughter\nA and you know I Want this state to be amazing and yes there's challenges associated with growth but there's also opportunities associated with wrote to help improve our quality of life decrease costs for family save them money on healthcare say family's money on education and how many Colorado more livable\nMississippi than any restrictions on growth\nNo growth brings economic opportunity let me explain the why Jared poll is is the most radical extreme candidate for governor in Colorado history here's why Jerry you'll unapologetically propose a\nA state run health care system which is thirty billion at least maybe more uh I don't know it's thirty two trillion it's a federal level you authored at so thirty two trillion divided by fifty or you've said that you are for a hundred percent renewable mandate which is another forty five billion a year for free preschool that's another billion\nA and and uh I don't know what else you're for but uh you you have no way to pay for any of this uh in Colorado's budget I can tell you is a treasure Colorado is thirty billion dollars you're proposing tripling Colorado's budget obligations and have no revenues to pay for it well let me tell you is treasure how you pay for it here in Colorado if you're a tripling\nOur budget or this may not work at the federal level because the federal government runs trillion dollar deficits but here in Colorado we have a balanced budget amendment and so what happens is when you were tripling Colorado's budget you either take it out on the taxpayer by doubling his or her income tax or else you pass it through the legislature through a death of a thousand cuts on visited all\nYou know the mayor of Colorado to live and were lawyers for our kids chair here you're the one who ... agenda that would put our state deeper in debt or do hire oh my God you voted in my car can overwhelm every ... Scott Santa you're not talking over\nEach other we're not getting anywhere with having to go head to head in a moment Dominic\nWe can keep us really thank you very much a a German speaking of economy as they do not grow forever everyone has been through an economics class recessions come frankly we're overdue\nAt some point during one of your ministry Asians are going to deal with the recession in Colorado what specifically do you need to do as governor to protect Colorado with the eventual slowing of our economy Mr ... we'll start with you\nYou know somebody who's created hundreds of jobs and several successful businesses in several sectors I Know the importance of a diverse economy\nBecause we always have downturns in different sectors fortunately and hopefully not at the same time last great recession in Colorado was driven by the housing crisis and I remember hearing from so many families in Adams County ... county who had home foreclosures so there's a premium on having a strong and diverse economy we need to make sure we have a rainy day fund\nOr we can afford to plunge the date of the ... the state into debt has Walker Stapleton a plan would do under one oh nine we need to save money for families\nHe had some questions about transportation and growth Marty\nThank you Sean thank you gentlemen of the questions I have\nAre pertinent questions for the state of Colorado but in particular to ... news radio listeners\nAre dealing with transportation and growth in traffic I Do need to tell both of you gentlemen\nOr some would say the Colorado is population has exploded will it has expanded by Thirteen percent in the last decade the state budget\nHas increased by fifty seven percent if at the same time at the state did not increase spending on the transportation infrastructure that the population seems to require based on that growth so do you support a sales tax increase to fund road construction in Colorado and I'll start with you Mr Stapleton\nUm no I don't and the reason I don't is because even though I understand the need to fund transportation I'm concerned that less than sixty cents on the dollar of that money actually goes to roads and bridges I think our transportation needs are so acute in Colorado that if we're going to pass a sales tax increase we need to make sure that it's been on roads and bridges bridges and roads and not\nA multi mode of transportation like congressman pulses radical extreme plans for for ah for our transportation fixes and and and that's not happening in this and and not John ... Colorado Springs a great friend who's endorsed me uh he already passed through his leadership of\nFifty million dollars in revenue increases at the local level if he were to sign on to this ah Marty a Colorado Springs becomes the highest taxed I um city in the state of Colorado in terms of sales taxes and he trades of fifty million that he re through two infrastructure increases for Fifteen million on a pro ride a basis that deal doesn't work\nFor Colorado Springs so I I Would support something more well thought out which will happen when I'm governor the state\nAs ... you know a Walker said the buses and light rail and bikes are somehow radical\nAre these are actually weighs real Coloradans get to work\nAnd yes I work to deliver lane expansion projects along highway thirty six Westminster Broomfield Boulder worked a took a liver federal support for highway twenty five north and the level in Fort Collins area\nAnd yes we need to include additional options provide more freedom of transportation to allow people to save money and get to work quicker ... I'm a supporter of making sure that in addition to lean expansion we have different ways that people could get to work look\nI'm I support the concept of having a dedicated funding source for bonding\nUm I I the sales tax is not my first choice ah and I don't think it's it's it's good to go into debt to the two to three billion dollars without any additional\nRevenue which is what what ... Walker staples and we do for a seat\nMr polish I'll start with you on this next question you alluded to the bonding do you think that either or proposition one oh nine or want to enter a viable solutions and if you do support setting aside state money for road construction how would you make room for that in the budget\nOutlook so if I think you're talking about a scenario now where they were they both failed that means that it'll be up to the governor\nOr to really lead to pass for to be the future infrastructure needs of our state or which really affect our quality of life I mean time in traffic is not only over six hundred dollars a year and extra wear and tear on your car and lost productivity\nOr its time away from family and so I Will look forward to using the governorship to be a convene her and she pulled together and unite\nRepublicans and Democrats people from western Colorado southern Colorado Denver metropolitan area in eastern Colorado\nOf people across the spectrum including the business community to make sure we have the very best plan to prepare for not only where Colorado is today but also where we are with regard to our growth in her future I just want to add that part of infrastructure to me\nMeans Internet and high speed Internet access in rural broadband because when we enter connect our communities we enable telecommuting reduce health care costs through tele medicine and yes it helps get cars off the road because people have the ability to work from home and and and do what they do and support themselves your thoughts Mr staples\nWill convene earns and chief uh sounds like Washington DC talk to me we need a dedicated revenue source from the general fund multiple dedicated revenue sources that we can apply to transportation for the long term I provided them congressman Pulitzer is not\nA he's not providing any way to pay for transportation except to convene people I talk about the neat I I oppose uh when I was treasure a director botch plan to spend a hundred and fifty million dollars on new offices for bureaucrats while all the rest of us out in traffic or that was not a priority that I supported\n... unfortunately the priority of the governor and his and a priority that congressman polish supported a and we needed to actually spend that money on our roads and infrastructure and uh I Believe a ... that we need to solve it not just on a one year basis but over the long term even if both of these\nBallot initiatives path or they're not going to be enough money to fund our infrastructure for the long term I have a plan to do it he has a plan to spend money cost Colorado jobs in wreck our economy\nPhilosophical question is it the state's responsibility to build infrastructure and build roads or do you believe in some sort of public private partnership again was stable too\nI think it is the state's responsibility and I think manage lanes can work\nOr in terms of public private partnerships people don't like them uh but we need to solve this if we want to have the infrastructure that makes Colorado world class city that makes makes people psyched to move here from the east coast to the west coast and live their lives here uh we need a first class infrastructure system we do not have that right now we have a crumbling infrastructure system and\nCongressman poll is wants to waste money on on on stuff that is underutilized like public transit in bike lanes and and I'm not disparaging that congressman but we have an acute need for roads and bridges to fix I Seventy to fix like twenty five and you want to spend money elsewhere I actually want to spend it where we need it the most was travels well\nLook you you said that even one oh nine and one ten aren't enough money for a big spender Walker Stapleton um look\nWe we we only have so much money in this state and if the voters don't approve those were going to need to find other ways to pay for transportation and yes\nPublic private partnerships absolutely overall it's also a role in the states to make sure that they actually benefit people are and could provide the needed conductivity there's no way the public private partnerships can meet all the infrastructure needs of our state they only work along heavily trafficked quarters\nIn fact that's a big part of how we would pay for rail with the private private public partnership\nThat would ban from future ticket receipts there would advance the money to help conduct\nOr from the suburbs to the existing light rail system in Denver Transportation's about moving people are and when you allow people different ways of commuting whether it's light rail and bus or it's up to you to take them and if you choose to 'cause if they can get you to work quicker\nAnd you can save money on gas and on car payments that helps put more money in your pocket to enjoy the Colorado you left\nWhen a dove tail on that question in the sense in regards to mass transit the reality is both a gentleman no you're not going to be able to build your way out of this in fact the construction projects we have now you're building for two thousand\nAt some point something's got to give a and one of those answers potentially is mass transit you obviously both have different ideas I think a lot of ... Colorado into like the idea of having freedom as well but at one point do you maybe tells the electorate and tell people that you were not going to build our way out of this and you either have to accept\nSitting in traffic for Ninety minutes on a commute maybe have to move away or say the reality is you're gonna have to be to some degree coerced use mass transit and build that infrastructure out and invest in that\nPaul's oh look I don't think that's something that a ... year will be it would be a failure of leadership um if the governor were not able to solve this problem or we have the plan to do it and pull us we're Colorado town to build a coalition urban rural Republican Democrat the business community to make sure we invest not only in our current trends\nYou shouldn't have but we meet the needs of a growing state in the future and yes that includes multimillion will of course that includes freedom of transportation of different options that includes ... late expansion includes fixing our our bridges and it includes a difficulty discussions and uh\nI think Walker's oppose every funding measure but once the plunge the dates they deeper into debt\nJust to dig out of where we are today a I'm willing to have that discussion\nOr with Republicans or Democrats from across the state and make the tough decisions to make sure that we can retain that amazing Colorado quality of life and reduce your traffic not only on your way to work but even if you want to go to the mountains or the great open spaces on weekends Mr safe then you have last word on the subject\nThe last word is that for Colorado to compete as a world class city we have to fix our infrastructure over the long term and not\nA over ... in an incremental basis as been at the the plan for the last\nUh two times we've tried to solve infrastructure and we can't just go to the taxpayers and ask for more money all the time like congressman pose wants to do when I was treasure and my first term I passed debt consolidation it totally reorganized away Colorado issues its debt unfortunately the department of transportation and higher ed weren't subject to that had broad bipartisan approval congressman\nUh and we don't have the accountability for house the dog is spending money right now a ... and if we did we would we would maybe better understand why we're spending more per mile on maintenance and other associated charges then a more than a half dozen other mountain states and so I Want accountability responsibility and transparency in government\nCongressman Paul is just wants to show the taxpayers to pay higher taxes and and probably ... maybe as an incentive to move them out of Colorado thank you gentlemen\nThank you thank you Marty so now for the segment you guys have been waiting for a chance for you to question each other this time we're going to have some time limits around thirty seconds to ask the question and minute to answer and wait a coin toss before we started the debate tennis Stapleton you want and opted to go first\nCongressman Paul is I have a friend named mark ... he's a U.S citizen from Mexico he's been working for ten years plus in the energy industry he's actually just bought his his first house he has a happy life but you're working against them\nYou've talked about Colorado where his job doesn't exist you supported anti fracking initiatives you've supported anti pipeline initiatives or you've talked about rigging the game for a new rules to a hundred percent renewable economy where fossil fuels don't exist level with Marty when you make his job obsolete\nI think it's up to governors to play a role in building the coalition and what you have to show voters as they've done the most with what you have\nIf you're ever asking for more our tax plan would go after corporate tax loopholes in today's tax code and use that revenue we would hope to eliminate oh about a third of these corporate tax giveaways and use that to reduce the income tax on Colorado families by three to five percent\nSo if I heard you right you'd support some increases in the corporate tax that close those loopholes but you wouldn't support any other tax like during your\nTime that the tax code you worked for people uh and when we have ... electorate is a lobbyist that have gotten special special tax subsidies for them or I'm not backed by the special interest I'm not taking any Packer special interest money in this campaign\nI Want to you and Coloradans a and John that means you have a little more money at the end of your paycheck every ... every month because I Know you don't have a bunch a lobbyist down there in Denver\n[noise] just to be clear a group supporting your ... are taking a pac money or Mr Stapleton or you oppose the current ballot measure to raise taxes for transportation education would you propose a tax cut of elected and how much\nWell I definitely wouldn't proposed a tax increase in I wouldn't propose what Congressman Paul ... is proposing which has some pretty\nUh questionable math um he is\nThe most radical extreme candidate that will ever be Colorado's governor if elected uh because uh I can tell you Colorado's budget is thirty billion dollars today twenty billion comes from all of us are in the form of our state income tax and sales tax ten billion from the feds most of that money has been used for the expansion of Medicaid\nCongressman poll says promise nearly Ninety billion dollars Ninety billion to a hundred\nOr maybe more spending I'm from a universal state run health care plan that he wants to bring back to Colorado that's at least thirty thirty five maybe forty billion or his renewable plan a witch hunt independent research Institute said would costs forty five billion dollars\nA and free preschool which is another billion dollars plus and John as I was listening but talking to you I'm Still waiting for him to be candid and say how he plans to pay for any of this because this will triple the size of Colorado's budget obligations and you either need to pay for it congressmen we've had this discussion again\nA bike taxis people through the ballot or we ... the defense mechanism which I support or alternatively are taking it out of the business community bleeding it out and regulations and fees that either one makes\nColorado and mark talking planet that are not mind the renewable energy or all your mind that we're on our soldiers may not only a hundred percent are centered channel not my plan is not the plan is backed by any of the mainstream environmental groups for this final segment we'll start with John\nAll right we are running out of time but we want to tackle a few questions and a quick format the star stayed around so we'd like you to keep their answers as short as possible no more than Fifteen seconds\nUs attorney Bob ... told our rec Salinger that he wants the state\nUh before going forward with things like hot clubs and pot and delivery 'em to take a pot right now he says that um pot is leading to a rise in organized crime teenage used traffic fatalities et cetera and do you agree that we need to hit the pause button Mr Stapleton\nAbsolutely and we need to fix our regulatory model a which has broken with respect to medical marijuana we we're not going to repeal marijuana but we need to fix it and I'm not for the expansion of recreational drugs like congressman polls as well I don't think\nThe Troyer or other Washington DC bureaucrats should be telling us what to do in Colorado Colorado voters have spoken regardless of what you think it's in our state constitution and yes we do to make sure we do what we can to make sure it's safe we keep it out of the hands of miners are\nAnd that we make sure that we have the right parameters are around a market that works for Colorado\nPamela calf next question gentleman would you continue governor Hickenlooper stay of execution for a convicted murderer Nathan done let Mr poll\nIs again I don't think it's appropriate in a political context content on somebody's life literally a I Would consult with the victims I Would read the case on and make an informed decision to enforce our laws Mr Stapleton\nThat to me sounds like a non answer a I don't think it's the job of the governor to re adjudicate a decision that's already gone through the legal process and uh I wouldn't uh um I wouldn't live to stay immediately but I Would have a review process a over a period of time to make sure that a what a judge and jury decided ah was not change a re educated by a sitting governor\n... would you encourage the legislature to specifically direct school funds to race teacher pay just able to\nUh no I wouldn't until we got our administrative costs in line because uh we did an analysis of our hundred and Seventy eight school districts and found out that ah\nStudents have grown by six percent teachers by eight I administrate of overhead by thirty five percent\nOr if we just kept from two thousand eleven on administrative growth in line with student teacher growth in some school districts are we would have as much as thirty five hundred dollars more to pay teachers uh this is how I approach fixing or broken education finance model and and without a going to taxpayers for a tax increase Mr polls\nWell I think what you just ask you the answer is the way to do that right so if we\nHave additional funding from the legislature let's restricted to make sure it reaches the classroom\nWhich means either greater teacher pay or or smaller class size but reaching the classroom not being intercepted by bureaucrats or administrators along the way an yes well I think we need to honor local control I'm willing to tie funding increases to restrict them to make sure they actually reach the teachers and reduce class size for\nColorado families John yes or no question when you sign a bill to ban read by cameras ... know Mississippi\nI'm probably not no okay I'm annoyed by them or we'll sit\nSo we want to ask you both\nThat question at the end you know we always end our debates this way we can both to say something nice about each other wants to go first I'll go first\nI think congressman poll is is a a creative guy or with bold ideas he and I are firmly support or the future of kombucha or he's entered federal legislation to do so uh we're both fans of cooking I'm just concerned that his bold ideas are writing checks of Coloradans can't cash ...\nA well to have a ... some time Walker when this is all over together as you know we've worked on actually reducing taxes for the boots or industry nationally with our bipartisan bill um but you know a look I think that um\nI Would look to work with you and my minister ration is somebody who might be able to provide some creative financing solutions and I think we need all the creativity we can around public private partnerships around preschool and kindergarten and you've had some of those ideas in the past and I know you'll have a lot more going forward\nThank you both I was very nice which I had to say I like the positivity here in this debate\nGentlemen I Want to thank you for joining us it's an important chance I think to educate voters and I want to thank our panelists and partners friends to get to trial ... radio and the Colorado sun and six thirty ... if he joined us late we want to tell you that\nYou can read watched the debate I think they teach loud tonight [noise]\n[noise] this is ... and we'll be saying goodbye to those listening on her sister station news

administration officials\nAnd delivered it with style and as I said with perfection\nThe construction of the sentence is something that should be taught in government classes and law classes how to give a winning argument\nIt just was ethic but what made it even\nMore important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins\nNow so often we hear that the public in party is the party of a bunch of old white guys\nWere you had three women featured you couldn't see I'm\nJoni Ernst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics\nSusan Susan Collins up there on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the ... none of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman\nDelivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice\nSo now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it\nThat in fact that the the people that\nThe um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart ruby way years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait\nSo you have brilliantly staged brilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time\nResponse so after all of the theater this week after all the circus atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC you ended with an epic finish\nSo bravo to you GOP bravo to you and to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure I think Spartacus got arrested today\nI'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for\nAh for Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I\nTalked to guys last night I found the ah yearbooks from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar and\nI don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a book or\nWe call a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um\nA young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was less\nGo all the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what\nSparked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating Mr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and on the day when that happened Chris Matthews\nThe elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role\nA Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats\nIt said when you go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves\nBecause you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth this year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nFish has time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their face and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews if you don't if you don't go after vengeance\nAnd he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss or I'll I'll tell you talk about backfiring\nBecause the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch\nOf people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a a good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity\nIt's an absolute attorney so I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interests of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens when you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms\nHistory tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that will share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really ridiculous question for you\nI Know the other day I asked a\nQuestion about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum anger\nAt the worst jangle ever and I know\nYou've heard jingles it doesn't have to be a current jingle it can be an old commercial jingle one is the worst jingle ever you know it's an ear worm it sticks in your ear I'm going to give you money you want to call in with yours and you can sing it or you can ... you can say however you want but when I hear one\nAge seven seven times for kids I Want to stab my radio\nOne age having having kinds for kids and then they

I think reason and logic and\n[noise] the system worked and it it didn't work really well because the only one Democrat out of forty nine Democrats is voting to confirm\nJudge Kavanaugh to elevate him to justice Kavanaugh only one out of forty nine that's not a good thing that\nReally is not a good thing but there is good news on a new poll out of Fox that says ah the things that are most important to people in the midterms the number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is health care and if you paid attention to date to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to President Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies he is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being health care the president a well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now three point seven percent unemployment\nThe lowest since Nineteen sixty nine and companies\nAre now are actually working to more people who left the employment world to come back to work they're trying to come up with new ways

literally\nTens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking fifty to a hundred and fifty grand a year and\nThey are jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show you\nHow you can uh get a skill and then go to work and my puts out scholarships for stuff like that so uh check that I didn't mean to get off track all also the fifth\nNumber one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the midterms to fit thing guns because Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal\nAnd Donald Trump is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bones towards the people who are ah kind of squishy on guns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a lifetime man or a member I'm a concealed carry weapons permit holder I'm a believer in getting trained\nAnd being sure you know how to operate your firearms and keep them safe but I also understand there are people who are ... bs another bonus word of the day today hospital a phobia you don't want to ... ... someone who when they hear the word gun\nThey immediately lose it I'm a little sister who hears the word gun and instantly her blood pressure goes up\nI could bite a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he's going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bumps stocks than a I'm Sorry but uh if there is a two\nLegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting that law\nAnd I think we could win points with some of those a hospital of folks if\nWe would say bump stocks aren't a good thing if you disagree with me convince me it's just one of those things that this gun owner the center a member is in lockstep with the president on it\nSo that that's where I'm at All right that's a couple of things are going on today 'cause we still have a lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a plan\nFor how I think that you can stay engaged and stay moving in the same direction towards the midterm because if the midterms were held a tomorrow or next Tuesday\nYou're living today's rushing by visiting Asia and other senior living today show with

hear me talking about how I didn't see it first I listen to it on the radio and then I watched it later I was more impressed after it when I watch the cars I realize this GOP is finally starting to get his presentation act together you know the two women in the background\nThe whole set up was just perfect\nWell you sound like an old Yankee Republican uh that's what a what do you know in the past you know she she has been you know confusing but today I got to give her credit I mean Russia just beautiful\nYeah I think she laid out a primary fishy case and why this guy deserved to be where

also wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how're you doing I'm gr are yeah I Wonder I Wonder if say that I think one of the reasons why the speech research skills or fearful is because it's a screw the truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump are so\nPopular with people because we're so used to all these politicians just here said he wants to be doing something else you know the number of following up all sounds good come up to a lecture and probably somebody actually scripture and our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power\nBefore Trump that was a pretty rare thing\nAnd I think she tapped into that raised by you know ... some of the consistency these people\nAt the television and they're just like you know why or why would why would you go back to a party you know ten times reader people will be drug to raise that anybody would an ounce of common sense\nJust have to say you know this is and the one thing I could face the media is so close to it and I hope these people never get a new power look everybody goes votes don't you go that these people that the media it'll it'll drive you crazy [laughter]\nI agree it's a great point any jingle you want to share with us a bad jingle that haunts you\nKnow yeah when you just said that that other guy I was sick and will ... head which could have been that good stuff I guess I don't think it's around anymore it's just it's butter but it's not it ...\nOh my God if you think is ... by it but it's not a long term memory somewhere I say\nOh that's a good bad one thank

on I'm rich Dennison Fox News ... senators announce who support for Supreme\nCourt nominee Brett Kavanaugh appearing to clear a path to confirmation made Republican\nSusan Collins after a lengthy floor speech concludes she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nMike what a night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight at what a speech today from Susan Collins\n... should rich have look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and at the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I was telling her I feel\nYour article fear and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer\nI Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the rigors for very emotional and very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one in the guy\nHad we not going forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a feta ... and not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we had every curve ball thrown at us like this process uh I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might but the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so eight skills and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the same\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who have oranges\nCredit card Eli family I think those folks need to find a way to recapture their party because it's quite ugly when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm fearful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case\nEvery battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I'm nervous that this victory happened too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate for politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue\nIn the election and I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm goes but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes\nIf we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled to a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country until the same thing that if the Republican Party kids simply keep this problem is the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of shared that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where if my party just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud and Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it to grant a Fox is you know they give it a big huge hug and I've\nBeen a real critic of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never Trump first and have come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises I'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promised that they kept their promise\nTo support a constitutional is a Supreme Court justice uh then we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and conservatives most that coalition are conservatives\nI think that there's great promise now more promise than I felt at a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you would have told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWho you are a hundred percent correct he deserves credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that he has ... you know not done yet a\nTomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee ticket shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was rupture sweat you get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so it was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick up Zell Miller's autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mold that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question\nYou'll have like five daughters you and mercy have five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters have to actually write\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations with my two older girls and one is a sophomore in high school um goes to a high school that's kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all fuel silver lined by the ah by the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable a talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I've talked to my eighth grader and I've talked to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also ah\nYou know what happens at our dinner table a lot is because they see their parents on TV which they think is really a kind of like the big deal but you know you gotta fight and I'll tell you what Brett Kavanaugh taught me this last couple of weeks that I wouldn't have thought that was this type of person as well as I Know he's pretty\nHe's pretty mild mannered you know he's low key\nBut you know what he did when they went to west to character assassination he fought back you fought back hard and when we talk about the around the dinner table we talk about that because they see their parents being criticized at the end we tell them that we're proud of what we do and they don't have to agree with us politically when they grow up they have to agree with us now by the way life is just fed it tore\n[laughter] that would ever believe they want that we talk about the need\nIn a democracy to stand up for yourself and to speak your mind and I think for especially young women that's really important lesson\nWell it's important that they know they have that arrow in their quiver and also that it's not the first era you pull out every time you know and I think ... showed us that he waited until he had to go there\nAnd then he fought back I thought that was a very powerful time and I thought today how did it with Susan Collins match slap I Can't thank you for taking time out of what should be a celebratory dinner night for you and your wife\nAnd I appreciate you for being a friend not only mine but of this show and the the conservatism everywhere\nThanks Mike you're a good man and I have to say that God Bless America I think we have a great future before us\nFrom your lips God keep us go in the right way thank you bat [laughter] we'll see you soon their egos match lap or if you've never been to sea pac\nWhich happens every year in the spring it's\nEven in a non presidential election year it is worth the trip if you're anywhere near DC and if you have a young person who's looking at politics and interested in politics especially from a conservative point of view it's really important that you get them involved

[noise] well\nThe budget stuff today his suit and my friends Michael ... come and do you live from that constitutionally protected free speech bunker in the woods of Delaware\nYeah I'm right here in the middle of the blue part of our state trying to make sure free speech freedom libertarianism and capitalism\nAre going to thrive not just survive thrive we're talking about the day\nWe're talking about Susan Collins a speech that Lindsey Graham even said while Lindsey Graham I we talk to if you will hear half an hour ago we're talking with match slap the American Conservative Union\nOr you know Matt and he's the white haired guy you see on Fox and even on MSNBC uh and and we're talking about the fact that months ago if you would have said Mitch McConnell Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham would be the three stars of the G O P we'd all go get outta here go home you're drunk\nBut there we are and we're talking to you guys about today and we're also talking about horrible jingles because I'm trying to get some of the horrible jingles on in my head and we've\nBeen reminded of some of the old ones like ... spaghetti owes and if you think it's butter but it's\nNot it's shift on George in Pennsylvania is checking in George tests due to my friend\nMy great great trading here\nNo thank you I you know bucking I go way way way back to the early days of the blaze and now that we're both\nA no longer at the blaze but this show is still on the blaze radio it's kinda cool you know it's kind of cool for us to all be together again so I'm really thankful for the opportunity what's on your mind tonight\nI hate the way we let the Democrats set a tone of this this they've tried to turn it into his ideas are radical are are not radical wrong he's got bad ideas you've got that if you\nYou have to worry about how his upbringing and all that kind of stuff she's an originalist\nAn originalist follows the law is in Turkey interprets the law the way it was written which was the whole idea of having along the first place when you have judges on doing that and rewriting law which you end up with as you end up with a committee\n... at a dictatorship it's a dictatorship by committee but it's still a dictatorship they're making all new laws they're making new rights their reinterpret the ... the ... which is in a totally totally devoid of were originally started\nAnd we've got a week they're going to be hammering on this we've got a week to turn this around and try to explain what an original list it does as a judge and the fact that it's exactly what the constitution designed was designed for\n... George or a hundred percent correct\nAnd part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves\nBut Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media Dana and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that ... we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it\nWe don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished what was it three weeks ago with constitution week\nAnd I guarantee the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution no and uh I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws are reinterpret the laws are I I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the appointment of more judges that are getting confirmed that a record rate and I think what's happened\nThere not just mad at cabinet all I think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and what\nDo you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed we are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so the\n... the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches it was just designed as a referee on the court\nI well I'm In the basketball court right there but there were there were designed to be the referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says we will re read it for you and tell you what the laws say they weren't they weren't there\nAnd only a few cold this toll free

zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nSo how about if folks me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body and still has to be converted into vitamins the three vitamin D three is the activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula\nI think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end as going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melt vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short developments and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men the men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and\nVitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties [laughter] that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and not functioning mhm and\nThen people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on a formula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and I AM radio clarity\nYou know this is more and more important as

C. S. J. lo and I argue radios\nOf owner you know and we are higher ...\nPusher on the bed laid on top of her ... her clothes off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away and then and then left she says it got to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and wanting interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't very no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl that I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite\nWell Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving bear left and right middle everybody's ... credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nSurely does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple due to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nCorroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was so as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope so\nIt helps you need some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have legacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and didn't report that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party there were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or is it was ... ... they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk she's going to remember anything and then uh she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her\nFace now she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacting her\nShe spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it\nI don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it\nTo which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity\nIs Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where they were the trains are boys are taking a gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quite moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them and activity to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for the another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable that ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay he that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because you know it causes all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that\nHe's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he made that\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women has said\nOr the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd of course the Ford only vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days\nInterviewing many more people came to ... didn't come to conclusions offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir ducks and people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us middle is a mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapist serial rapist Jennifer rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way they are trying their best to change\nThe best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now what what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this I I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee ever in your life I guarantee that is true\nBut let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a politically you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree with Trump\nYou have to be sickened by what what the less done here right\nLet's talk about it it's a

I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of this can be I Will clear this room would be given interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol is when they were breaking it on purpose\nJust they really thought through putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made

is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning a trainer at a man lakes being healthy\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classes that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill but\n... he he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have to cross in this country

junior top of the hour right here on the weekend with Joe pacts we go back to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to a Christie in Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh a lot of stuff going on [laughter] you bet on TALK to me I just\nFind it very very hypocritical that here were interviewing the man to be a um fair and fair and honest person who decides that printed court cases right we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he's accused at these faceless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said back then survivor of a sexual assault more than one\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let off allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to compare that with Kavanaugh\nRight if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying like decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want this ... that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho is surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before

for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTestify under oath it's the Senate Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the processed foods folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting ... on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so

I think he came away because she's not even licensed so radicalized and there's going to go for ... you\nWrite that was one of her many lies that I Hope the FBI is is focusing on\nWhat people in line and she doesn't like the while you're listening to a tropical island somewhere where she'd go snorkeling\nAnd the\nDanger is no that is one of the most hilarious\nI'm I mean I ... I'm Still you know in a blind rage here right um this is about how\nNo she's afraid of flying it's first of all that's part of the Trump allegedly right she's suffering she can't stand to be an enclosed space right number two it was used to put off her testimony Brett Kavanaugh's be accused of rape assault\nUm indecent exposure wild drunkenness center right parties and you have to just sit and take it without being able to testify for a week right didn't lay on the ground that Dr Ford because of her trauma was afraid to fly well that just went out the window so that's a pretty big why\nDo you ever given him a committee wouldn't go to her over the church where they would so the whole thing was is just a sham she doesn't know when it happened what year it happened how many people were there were the house was what the neighborhood was who\nDied regarding which at her home sided than\nI have all refuted it they didn't know he did not have been refuted what'd you say you're in colder no more Mr White guy I'm gonna I'm going to post a link to this too that maybe the her latest book is resistance is futile how the Trump hitting left last has lost its collective mind\nAnd we are we seeing that with cattle and\nReally are in and I got to tell you I don't know\nI'm I'm kind of dumb in a mostly white although my skin is much more Italian all of a book [laughter] I'm a white guy and I'm watching it in Ford is white and blue sweat Nick is white\nAnd there are white men on the left that we're asking questions and they were really mad at Blumenthal good lawyers face off he was really mad I'm all these people everybody involved with the story's what except for Deborah\n... and we can argue about whether Hispanics you're white or black or would the races but this is not this has never been about race he'd wanted to go there\nUm it's but this has has been a cliche for some time I'm I've been noticing this Hillary you probably don't remember this but in one of her slams of Trump during the campaign she said something to the fact of um he has an odd funds for white autocrats\nI Do remember that no I yeah so okay\nCast your mind once again we're going to think about actual fact here in your mind over the world and think of where there are dictators autocrats or something like that it may have been\nWhite authoritarian rulers well I I think I'd start with the entire continent of Africa I wouldn't\nMove my way up to the middle east we would get lots of autocrats authoritarian rulers in in in the far east um\nI guess she's talking about who and who was the only white autocrats I can think of he's not exactly start one\nHe's even Khrushchev right but she throws\nAnd that's one thing people like me started to notice oh my gosh white is just it's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense a fire and has no actual meaning other than um\nIt's really bad why\nIt's so bad because of his white noose in colder no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left or media you've got to be understanding they have all these white men will be questioning Islam and the next one is women across the nation should be outraged that white men senators are doing this to a woman there's been\nSome discussion but you'll be centers you happened to be all white men I mean I\nI don't I don't understand that there's so much anger against white men and so much guilty even white men themselves that this crap works in\nUh it hasn't worked on may\nNor me and I go out as I Am I'm Still a white dude\nIt's um it's very strange and I also take issue I mean I at least understand the logic of saying it should be women women understand massage any and that shouldn't be a panel of women questioning and alleged sexual assault um accuser\nUm but the last time um that I can remember where I'm somebody one big for don't worry women understand massage any and end violence against women wasn't when they pick the OJ jury\nRight or a member that was Marsha Clark big idea\nBlack white I don't care as long as they're women they will bond with with um what's her name I'm Nick Nicole Brown Simpson right on didn't work out for oh no oh\nI guess the jury didn't see the point so I think it's idiotic to say that only women should be\nShould be questioning that actually don't you have all these rape laws as Janine bureau said right\nBless her soul she said you know for years I've been prosecuting sex crimes cases and I was prosecuting them under laws written by white men I mean at the top feel when he
