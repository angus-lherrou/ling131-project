Fox News President Trump hauling the first time a series of rallies is less than a week to go until the mid term\nFlorida\nSins of the United states and of the state where in they reside so this this came as as a real um trio of a civil war\nAmendments including abolishing slavery on the thirteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment which does a whole bunch of important stuff including that and of course the fifteenth amendment a which says that the right to vote cannot be a bridge based on race so\nI'm I'm trying to understand what it is that they were trying to achieve back in what was Nineteen Eighteen sixty eight with this amendment ... it was it so that anybody who immigrated here and had a baby would become a United States citizen\nKnow the primary thing they were trying to achieve with this particular clause along amendment issue as you know we're just talking about the first sentence of it which is called the citizenship clause\nIts purpose was to ensure that African Americans who were born here even if they had been slaves or were uh were treated us citizens as you know of the United states\nAnd just for refreshing my my history even those slavery\nWas legal\nUntil the thirteenth amendment importing slaves was against the law correct at a certain point\nThat's correct and that raises a whole host of very interesting issues because anybody who is imported between Eighteen away when the slave trade was made illegal and Eighteenth ... sex when slavery was abolished\nThat person was an illegal alien and um you would think that ...\nNot a not a ... none of his own shoes\nAnd all of his own show he's in the country illegally and so you would think that Congress would have taken that into consideration but the\n... where there are a lot of I'm Sorry with a lot of slaves who were smuggled into the United states after the ban on importation of slavery wildly\nBuying a lot I I don't know that anybody really knows we no ... no certainly that there were such person and that they're not and that their presence was known about but the people who drafted the fourteenth amendment you know they weren't like the founders of the U.S\nUp the founders of the people who wrote the original constitution were extremely precise\nAbout the language they use their extremely competent draft\nA lot of people who tell you out there that language and the original constitution is vague it generally is not what the fourteenth amendment was not as well drafted and so I'm not even sure that the people who drafted it really knew what the phrase\nSubject to the jurisdiction meant in completely they they did understand that if someone was let's say born in Indiana tried out in Montana Territory before it was a stay at that person would not be a citizen I understood that\nAre they understood that someone who was born in this country was African American even if he or she had been a slave would be a set of\nBut I don't think that they fully thought through all the implications of what subject to the jurisdiction there of means and selling Supreme Court has had to struggle with that phrase on two occasions\nAnd only two occasions says this is a law that's been around for what a hundred and fifty years or an amendment and it's only been looked at it from the Supreme Court twice\nExtraordinary isn't that a but there's a lot of ... there are a lot of provisions of the constitution like that\nBoth of the cases that interpret that language subject to the jurisdiction there off off of them arose in the latter part of the nineteenth century one held that I'm a Indians who were parts that were members of tried\nA out of the territories that they were not citizens now they they were later granted citizenship by statute but they were not subject to the to the jurisdiction of\nThe United states for first up there 'cause that's that's fascinating fourteenth amendment and the fourteenth amendment that's I just want to make sure I'm I'm up to be with them so when the fourteenth amendment passed\nIt did not apply to Native American Indians\nAnd that later on by an act of Congress they were made into citizens but even even those people who were born in American territory because they were on a reservation whether they were an Indian Territory they weren't citizens of the United states\nThat's right the tribal tribal members okay I mean if somebody was in India and voluntarily left the tribe and came to you know be an American citizen that that was different\nBut I Try tribal Indians were not citizens the second case dealt with the question of the children of illegal immigrants\nOh what happened here was that there was a Chinese couple living in California in San Francisco they were here in this country illegally and they had a son and then the son left the country to go visit China came back and the immigration authorities wouldn't let him out and they said you know you're not a citizen\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court said he absolutely it\nSays ah that because he was born by legal that's right and what it was that ruling they set those uh that that's a Eighteen eighty four and so that I'm a that decision held that people who are in this country illegally\nOurs are in what the what the\nRob you're gonna have to hold that thought I got to run to a break but stay with us Robert Wilson is

Congress could similarly interpret all the phrase as he had a team's best but the ultimate decision is going to be up to the courts\nOkay so I haven't heard\nPaul Ryan say this would be a question for Congress\nCould\nOnly tell them to get to see my Elena don't\nYou can also share than half a block on line [noise] teach them they can be more than a bystander and if they can help their ears\nMore on marine visit family doctor not one of our talk with your family physician\n[noise] your numbers guy but that wasn't a twenty thousand\nHow many American men down this year alone\nThe second most common can't\nOne is seven men one of five African\nOne and three you have a brother fought\nKnow your sat\nTossing a doctor vouch for profit health because they noticed that thought off today than a game like [noise]\nI'm Dr Kathleen you maintain with the American Academy of family physicians with important information on fire and safety\nFirearm injury happen every day it was important to teach your kids what to do is they find a firearm\nWhether it's real or not they should always apply to simple rules don't touch boom way in Helena don't remember firearm injuries and one of the top ten causes an accident related deaths in children\nSafety visit family back or not or or talk with your family physician ma'am\nAs they can and wanting more every inch of the\nAnd I've been tracking bacterial meningitis shut down version that's my ... came to me\nBut I didn't get back on my dream metal then the Maryland and another nation of Sierra published author named him to run around the Paralympic Games when their dreams like me your money where the Americans\nIn here in children's miracle network\nYou're listening to the Michael Brown showing ... news talk side looney PCS Jay\n[noise]\nNine minutes of the top I'm John killed era in for Michael Brown if you'll forgive me called real three seven one three eight to five five seven one three talk\nSo surprise surprise when the experts on television tell you the president does not have the authority to do this with complete certainty he does not have the authority to\nDo to make sure that people who come here and have a baby who are here illegally that baby can't be a citizen well the answer is we don't know the courts haven't looked at it since the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd that whole little of jurisdiction phrase has a lot lot to do with it so the beating force if they have a baby year according to the Supreme Court ruling back then those people who are not citizens\nI'm not convinced this is a slam dunk he can't do it\nThe way that the New York times and NPR will tell you to go to the phones three ... three seven more than three to five five to Denver we go Mike was with me John killed era so like\nI I Would love to see a lot more background that the example that Nader sing gave about uh the rescue boats\nTaking a pregnant woman on a like to know more history about when that sort of thing came up\nAs it always I mean I don't know that we can gauge in rescue operations that long and ... as it was it sort of default because the anchor baby concept was already kind of ingrained and so they just people that did that or is there some actual legal reason for it the last ...\nOr get it that the southern ... I think the point of what Rob Nielsen just taught us is that whole\nLegal principle hasn't been challenged to the courts for for a resolution since late Eighteen hundreds so anything that the president does\nCould start the ball rolling on what that really means so even by him making such a pronouncement via executives I'm\nAn executive order it could result in clarity on what the Fourth Amendment means as far as citizenship so I don't I I kinda hope he does it\nAnd and then just to be clear as far as the less concerned there is nothing this president can do that he has the authority to do yet if president before he put in more executive orders and the other incident yesterday think yeah it was fine or aid even\nBe in there right now yeah so uh but the last word in that sort of settings paragraph wherein they reside that reside word also strikes\nMe you know if you're here on vacation you don't reside here\nThat's why the the reasoning for it applying to slaves of course they reside here this was their their home at least you know I had been for quite a number of years they didn't just happen to be walking through on it you know vacation\nAnd that reside anyway I just think well I had\nI I think the resigned regular I I think that refers to pardon my my English at the nuns taught me\nBut I Believe that means of the state so in other words it says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and the here's the fund raise and subject to the jurisdiction there of meeting the jurisdiction of the United states\nAre citizens so this is the other part of the sentence they are citizens of the United states and of the state where they reside which means that if you reside in Colorado your Colorado citizen if you write and I didn't\nLike what if you're just you're on vacation and you have a baby you don't reside here you just happen to be standing on\nThat right by the phrase or moment I I missed the time when when I was a kid the nuns would have us um graph out sentences you have to do a graph you have to do this you do these lines and so\nThe where of has to do with being a state\nBut that that doesn't come into play unless you are a citizen subject to the jurisdiction there up so if you're not a subject of of jurisdiction therefore you're not as a citizen in the United states then that last phrase end of the state where in the reside\nWouldn't apply to that person graft right up to ... and it becomes you know\nThey could have just as easily left out that whole section of and subject to the jurisdiction there they they wouldn't have put it in there if it met anybody who has a baby on the soil it's completely redundant to put it in there if that was the meaning\nAnd let's remember when this was ratified when this was ratified it Eighteen sixty eight it's not like you could jet on over here to drop your baby off of it to get here was in or deal or unless you live right on the crowd really should go up or do I do like\nThe Canadian border you know neighbors\nMy buddy even him in to make to try to make the trip back then was not was not an easy thing so it had more to do with slavery that had had dry with with immigrant knows\nAnd those people live here anyway I just I think it's a to think that the anchor baby concept applies I think flies in the faith that negates any other immigration law you can have it just makes\nNo only taken or taking my call see when we had an anti really fast and they we got less than a minute you're with John Caldera Hi Andy\nOh a lot for taking my call I I'm\nA parent or

her\nCompletely insane statement on air which he did that have to back down from and apologize because it was so dumb that it was indefensible but but in response to that I said this is not even the dumbest thing that you will see or hear on CNN all week\n... not even this week will that be the single most because we've got an election coming up next week ... people are going to try to out to one another on the left with stupid hyperbolic destructive nasty comments\nI said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present to you to prove me correct none other\nThan Mr Don Lemon play Clipper too\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group for any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat of something else some ... some people who were marching you know tours of order like a feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop a theme and I think people and realized the biggest terrorist threat and in this country is white men most of em radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor\nSays we need to stop demonizing people comma and understand that white men on the right or the real threat they're the real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\n\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV and you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on there's a ... no no no he is\nRepresentative of the overall mindset on the left that's why we did the montage this is this is what these people this is what the other side's\nA laugh the Democrats what they think they really believe that they're not the problem at all when it comes to\nOverheated dangerous rhetoric and the other side is the problem dot dot dot because the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi began Dina fold you know ... ... with blood on their hands\nOh\nI see that that\nIs at the heart of why we're having such a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness that don't even have the ...\nThe the the honesty to be able to understand that you are not going to improve the temperature\nOf political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the rights stack fires and Nazis and ever did you hear that opening montage\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know what it you know what it really drives a lot of this\nIs the success or the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it or that\nThey told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they would be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences of having Donald Trump as president\nBut you see\nWe have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and it's suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming\nEconomy a ton of investment no massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to send our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that the powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end in what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's\nThose are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've felt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of some of the most celebrated\nNames in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power in ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong all they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude\nIs tone a but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base or\nFailed miserably no quite the opposite\nThey they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to withstand them and six she'd despite all of their efforts\nHe's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together in such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are\nIf they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if\nThey can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times is a liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people\nVote Democrat it rattles them\nIn a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up\nRight we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even if someone just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case\nI Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing\nThat there is an objective neutral press that is the the center of our our media apparatus that never coming back that's gone now we\nNow we expect honesty and trends parents do or else there will be at least push back there will be a fight over it but the\nCalls for civility from Democrats the last couple of weeks as I've been saying all along\nHas been in bad faith what they want\nIs for conservatives it for Trump and for the right to engage in self\nDoubt and just stop fighting\nAnd there will be no reward there'll be no meeting in the middle when the right decides to stop pushing for its beliefs and what it thinks is correct and what is best for the country all you will have is the left exploit the situation for their own ends and then go back to what we saw for the\nEight years of the Obama administration which was rub your enemies faces in it at every opportunity right to the\nLeft under Obama took the attitude of no prisoners politically speaking they didn't just you know overrun conservatism for at least the first few years of Obama's time in office they overran the conservative outposts number ... all the survivors\nIt was rough\nThere was no good said there was no meeting in the middle there was no bipartisanship no triangulation nothing\nNow where do you believe that we should win it looks like there's so much more on the horizon that would be good for the country and the Trump could accomplish now we're supposed to listen to the opposition\nWas that based than anything that's worth telling anybody that I asked three three people that were we wasted outside of a bar who were just trying to pull my legs I mean what what what's going on here\nThis is how they do it though is how the left engages in his manipulation of reality and they really just wanted to make this even ... a more divisive moment make it even more difficult for the president\nOf the United states to be able to do his job here which is to try and help and he'll be American people by turning it into some you know batch Trump's session these people are a disgrace and you don't it really comes down to they don't believe that he's the president they ... they they don't accept it not my\nPresident you remember that chance on the streets they think that he's not just not their president but he is not the president period\nUnfortunately they are wrong but they're delusional enough

you for taking my call like I Know you're going to get on the subject of is a burst right deal\nPeople are informed of the fourteen conch constitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal birthright yep\nOh I'm In it that in death coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens no court has held that illegal aliens\nOr should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nDo you consider people who are foreign citizens meaning citizen of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to this age children of slate\nWasn't weren't near the fourteenth amendment was what was for it was for yet that the descendants of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions in overlapping jurisdictions but it should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's\nWing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie and this is where the Democrats don't really understand is that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country are you know they always take the side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face and\nYeah he has every right to do that yeah\nI think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much Charlie for ... calling from Maryland Steve in in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Steven\nHey hey hey Mr ... all the wisest one I I really enjoy your show your your your discussions are extremely thoughtful and I really appreciate that you're very kind\nOn

the Trump presidency they've lost a lot of union ... or ... says they're analysts towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on\nThe ... thing I Wonder and wondering is on the ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare all day because there's a crisis of a caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out\nBecause one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in his country means your your ability and freedom to do something in his lap don't like to comment on a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that\nTechnically new immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe states are so you you cannot be a dependent on the state and that you know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system\nIs set up as we know that's not the case what ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have an as a child who is a is it given citizenship either to uh to illegal parents then benefits accrue\nTo that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a a two year old you don't give a newborn a government benefits you have to give it to the parents and ... so there are ways that families because they also will\nI'm Nick ... is a liquid

here on TALK by nine ACS Jay [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking about here you have a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he eats weeded out to politifact today\nAre are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass\nShooters who are white males that were\nIf anything political leftist but you know that this is this is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that they will uh they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down and you say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of\nShooters in this kind of measures in this country um turns out that's not\nTrue it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation of for all the different\nEthnic groups in this country but uh your ears would you find out they've never\nMass shootings but I'm an overall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about some communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed\nUm but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine are male\nSo as a river that we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried\nAbout their the terrorists they're the real threat um that Don Lemon says that's what that other guy was a radio show I've never heard of jazz Ninety nine percent of shooters our our mail in this country\nCountries also Seventy percent white so if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and the country is Seventy percent white but\nOnly fifty four percent of mass shooters or white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nUm of other groups that are not ... they're both issues so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places think they're really making about this I mean what I remember I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many are white mass shooters in the country\nSo why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is in a relevant and really pointless exercise uh but they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOr ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity\nOr whether we agree with that or or not um then you get to the terrorism side as an odd sort of make this brief\nUh that that the ... George mafia are of more on from Charlottesville it's talked about so much in the media just goes to show you that they\nCan't find where ... where's this these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying that don't exist and say how many are there really very very few\nAnd you refer to that as a rise of a real terrorism in the country and now that the biggest terrorist threat and people like that or people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national\nCounterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security apparatus for this country of all kinds because we're worried about right wing\nNationalist terrorism we have it because of Islamic radicalism or less the in the post nine eleven security apparatus we have is specifically designed to deal with the threat of radical Islam\nAnd I know that right now we're in a little bit of a low the terms of radical Islamic you know knock on wood radical Islamic attacks in the United states\nBut that doesn't mean that that's not the primary threat and people who say this garbage\nAbout how the real concern the real terrorists threats a real threat of extremist violence comes from white nationalist\nOr or being disingenuous and they don't know what they're talking about I Know that there are major a major departments and agencies that yes they they do have a they do have you know some entities that deal with you know radical\nA neo Nazis and things like that they have very very little work to do day in and day out folks counterterrorism that's assigned to a you know anarchists and right wing nationalist and stuff they're not\nBusy it is the counter jihad his folks that are always very\nDon't wait until Black Friday for a great deal on the floor you want to get a great deal today and get a new floor in time for the holidays and lumber liquidators get a waterproof floors from just sixty\nFour since ... best selling hardwood up to twenty six percent off plus get pre Black Friday flooring deals like thirty two percent off bull barn oak laminate to do with yourself or have us install it for you plus get special financing don't wait busier local lumber liquidators store or lumber liquidators dot com today\nAre you looking to buy a home or refinance or existing mortgage loan United dot com were so confident we'll give you the lowest mortgage rate and if we can't we don't give you one hundred dollars and the lowest mortgage rate is just to start at\nLow United we don't charge any processing underwriting or junk fees what are you waiting for pick up the phone and called eighty three three oh you alone that's eight thirty three year loans or visit online that loan United dot com in one sense except when you're in a matter of fact I was looking at when central any trouble we prefer to go through the freedom to when I first read it can be rich but only like\nFive Ninety Casey this case was\nSprings Colorado is news saw dependable accurate balanced [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey and Jerry\nAnywhere else in a fraction of the price I'm going back on me dot com tonight [noise]\nDoing Dave return every Saturday and the third for the senior living today show so sure about seniors for seniors and this was the bill covered topics relating to hell independence and overall wellbeing of seniors right here in southern Colorado\nAnd you're living today is for us to buy the games and other five sponsors senior living today shall we do return early Saturday morning and said hey thirty [noise] leashes on cable news top five Ninety Casey is Jay\n[noise] five Tracy Esther was low and I argue radios\nDot com and on your phone with our high orange radiolab\n[noise]\nThe final sunshine ... Fox News President Trump in Florida stomach for gubernatorial candidate round status and Senate candidate and current governor Rick Scott resident telling the crowd why you think they should vote red\nWhat I see from our own side and you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all [noise]\nYou know I Know he's not running anymore but you'd think that for all the time it's been a concern circles and here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer but then again neither am I but\nI seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is\nA very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... and following the plain text of the constitution I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is among check illegal immigration\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a foreign ... is a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction is he really subjective\nI mean you know this is where he started to get it okay well hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France\nAnd and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American\nTaxes would you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French draw a French French joy on French soil or I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen\nI saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography and that's\nWhere this gets ... that's what this gets more complicated and there are instances already where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen right in the case of the sons of ah indoors diplomats who were born here and they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship\nSo that\nIt's a place where there's no clarity often the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs\nAnd has just been show wimpy end immigration for so long and for him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick the machines do the GOP side I got to say I was I was pleased\nThat at least at least from was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see\nThat are here we go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul right look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it isn't a Portage but that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here and yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay\nIn maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels wherever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get citizenship here and you know birth tourism\n... that's clearly not what the law just but you know Ryan just can't help himself I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party there I say and and that brings you back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country because I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party\nIt's a you know they're bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or indeed a senator or other Joe Donnelly here's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side and on the Senate side or state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job\nOr director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine [laughter]\nWhat the heck is this guy saying I mean\nCould you imagine every Republican I Know he misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right Well Bruce or might you know cigarette break\nUp a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're you're you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't sound like much of a government does the bread banks I think\nI mean brand and you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people would be like her\nYeah exactly\nSo this is what you get this this is the Democrats the best and the brightest both the Democratic party\nSenator Joe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side offers up as a Republican did it that would probably be the end\nOn the radio on\nIf I die [noise]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry

I'm going to read you now from the book of poems they say in the media uh\nYeah so this is where you see that they they have no actual principle that they are protecting or that there there are trying to Institute here because they're ... they're very literally there's been a interpretation of this clause\nLet's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant you mean at the time right this is where liberals\nWho would do the right to bear arms you can have ...\nMillion in Brussels that's why we said arms yes\nAt the time it wasn't a are Fifteen it was ... but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then we're arms are now\nAh and that's why the press the press has any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press and the jurisdiction there oh okay well what does that exactly mean what does that mean\nBased upon the understanding that the time in what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment\n... remember that the Obama administration\nUm first of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and here's a here's a great example um of of that you have Harry Reid\nOkay this was even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most powerful Democrats in the country until recently this is what he had to say about illegal aliens play quibbling\nKept making an easy to be an illegal alien is enough\nAbout offering a reward for being in a legal [noise]\nDo some no sane country within the\nIf you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child\nWe reward that child with US citizenship\nThat's right we do\nThis was like okay you know if if I Rob a bank I'll get in trouble but my kid who didn't do anything wrong you know my my baby when he grows up he gets the trust fund I made with the money from robbing the bank dishes\nIll gotten gains\nCould try to think of it any other way they want they try to go with other explanations of it but that's just the truth and you know ... now you have this debate over the fourteenth amendment of the fourteenth amendment let's just get right to it right now uh it's all about making sure that after the civil war is written in sixty six after the civil war\nThere was no question as a matter of law that African Americans would be granted or or had would even be granted we had a full citizenship and all the rights and protections that that can first", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "01"}
