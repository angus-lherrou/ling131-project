Hollywood but yeah you one of the you wanted to like be from a symmetrical the Google God's don't like long headlines as I've learned so each would silence on Clinton's final hashtag me to straw\nThat's pretty good thanks yeah yeah so the kids were with her [laughter] right [laughter] bend come here and he smelled of life I got a forty five characters we can do from it All right hold on death but then my tablet\nThis drives me crazy and I know we are a lot of what we do is double standards and hypocrisy of Hollywood but we just saw Hollywood simply go to war with Brett Kavanaugh and and I just disgusting way\nAbsolutely assuming without without a shadow of a doubt that he was guilty and it's a horrible human being as we heard from weeks from Hollywood not just one actor to act or it's just a lot of them Reese Witherspoon I mean a lot of people even people you don't often think of as very proud of the\nPeople that you think are generally a little quieter exactly\nDisgusting and yet Bill Clinton announces his speaking tour with the misses where you have to pay up to seven hundred dollars plus to listen to him speak I'm thinking oh my goodness gracious really do we not know what he was up to\nWell I just see I thought we knew what he was up to it in this week Hillary came out and said that there is a difference in ...\nAnd ... and so I listen to it several times very closely and drink and I was in like ... okay yeah you're [laughter] you're in a higher place right now yes\nHollywood and took a little math little read a little older I got the\n... little little little push shove what's amazing in Hollywood right now look at the industry so James Franco is had multiple accusations that he did something wrong behind the scenes he's still working constantly\nAlec Baldwin is admitted to bullying women and not treating them well he can't work any harder he said he sold I think the Hollywood Reporter said I'm busier than ever at sixty right an age where maybe you know maybe actor the gang\nStarted yelling out the gay photographer whatever was on the street\nI mean melt down after melt down here it's just that ... is is hope passes chock a block with disastrous situations\nAnd then you've got T. Dallas and who was accused of above of being abusive by a woman with more proof than Christine Blasey Ford ever served up to anyone and then you think about Bill Clinton the person that they couldn't wait to get back in the White House via Hillary\nThey don't seem worried about him they don't say a word about his ... or they don't see a worried about what he was up to how wrong it was they don't have the decency to say we were wrong we shouldn't have rallied around him he should've resigned base and all the things he did\nNot vote the funny thing is not funny but I'm not a funny about oh how funny but we're going to reach back to\n... when he was in high school in those early years in college but we're not reach back to simply essentially the same time period when Bill Clinton wasn't in high school wasn't in college and it was in the oval office mhm but we're not gonna touch them\nNot with a ten foot pole it's just amazing you know when ... when we talked last year about Harvey Weinstein and the whole scandal in me to move in ... birth we thought I thought\nWell that does it how it can get political anymore right ... ... they must have so much shame built into their their lives thinking we covered this up we didn't report it we didn't speak out\nWe had to take a moment to just reflecting what we did wrong and and never do it again and they go right back on that horse and said hey we're gonna wag her fingers at you twenty four seven they're still doing it and I'm sure there's still stuff going on behind the scenes I'm hoping it's less\nI'd just aghast at it and no one talks about this at all and especially in the Hollywood Reporter is in the deadlines and the rats and all these different organizations that are meant to cover Hollywood they don't see a word about the science though\nI get this whole thing you don't have to necessarily speak out against every injustice in the world you know if there's a murder down the street I don't you shouldn't yell at me for not tweeting about how horrible it was I get that but when the industry as a as a collective voice against Brett Kavanaugh and has zero voice against Bill Clinton\nThat something because there's a cultural divide there is a cultural war and they took their side and they they they they are in capable of critical thinking they already capable of self aware as they are inflicted with cognitive dissonance and nothing from ...\nThe thing is the victim of all this is going to be the me too movement the is it because it's been so connected to Hollywood because that's where it ran\nYou're going to think of say wait a minute there they're judging one person the flimsy isn't evidence ignoring all these other people but far greater pieces of evidence\nWhat's missing here what's going on why should I Believe them and by the way and emissions my story just because James Franco was accused of X Y and Z doesn't mean he's guilty I mean she was accused of it right we don't know the whole story\nAnd ah you know but we don't know the whole story of a cabin or either but it looks like there's almost zero information that says he did what he did\nAnd lots of information that suggests he didn't do anything\nI think it I think it does at some point\nIt doesn't necessarily destroy the me too movement with them that faction of mulch real war but it destroys with them those who are not necessarily that involved a of a better observing from from the bottom of the of some distance\nI think it destroys all credibility with people who are a lot of that\nGeo location

checkup after being released from house arrest in Turkey earlier today family spokesman Jordan secular\nIt's a celebration but it's also a time when you're going through a lot of emotions very quickly a lot happening this has been a horrendous process as pastor Brunson set a terrible process for his family\nSomething that nobody could really know that's something that nobody was able to to figure out until now what it looks like oh that's right that televised ritualized torture session of Brett Kavanaugh on national TV turns out Republicans haven't forgotten about that\nAnd it turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but I think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just\nIn a sense the last straw that has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these these symptoms of the mass delusion of leftist that are\nManifesting themselves with these Matt a masters in these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality\nAnd on and the really the lack of ability on the media's\nPart just set the narrative the way they want you in the air rage which comes out now more on there I think it's because they realize\nTrump is winning he still winning\nThey haven't been able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense\nThey haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of the twenty Fifth Amendment and uh the investigations and his finances I mean the New York times did I think it was a twelve thousand\nWord essay on Trump's taxes stretching back to his father's taxpaying\nPractices in the seventies I think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean that they they went way way deep into was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this is kind of like the scene and John Nash the John Nash\nHasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy writing on all this stuff all the formulas and the wall and you and then you realize oh\nThis person has a problem the media has a problem\nFrom maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem they are no longer objective in all of this\nAnd now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and they have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they're really going to all of a sudden you\nKnow just discovered that oh Russia manipulated this election true is that going to be the play\nIt might be but I don't think\nThey have any real belief that that will that will stick with that will work what do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is racist Trump is a is a a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president that they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed\nFor that reason and it turns out he's doing a really good job the economy is chicken but\nAnd I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work as a study this that\nEven though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would have called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying\nThat as you get worse last Eighteen months and it has it so what do they help themselves what did they come away with and this then brings me to the outrage mobs anti fall and the uh you know the the\nMarch ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh hordes\nThen the the stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers who are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them away at a Republican who put a\nBlock slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later big high five bugs issues increasingly looking like the last\nIs gonna have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can to stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its\nIts intended goals from doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it\nAnd I think that what set in with many of them is is not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nAnd the left must be telling them so we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we could at least get them going at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turned on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month\nWhat does that mean for the left how do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage annoys an anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint your counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I Know that it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with Kavanaugh the very end of the nomination process it's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture\nSomething they will create whole call some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough that they have a successful midterm election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something up because they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just good for America\nPeriod they never or reflective on the situation and an honest way\nIt's always Trump lied Trump cheated Trump is a liar and a cheat why haven't we seen his taxes he groped women without their consent why does he have you know such tan skin and and it's crazy orange hair and all this other you know blonde hair all that that they just hate him so much they don't look at this for what it really is\nAnd I do think that the the rage moms or anger than ever because they are reaction to Trump's success they would like you to believe that they are an opposition force their hash tag resistant they stand up for Trump's but that's only part of the story the other part of it\nAnd could lowest right you know the Chinese government needs to be brought into line here and it's going to require some pushing it's not an easy thing to do but Trump is taking on things that he knows are important without regard to well is this the simplest route\nObama showed his what eight years of sitting back relaxing and not really doing very much in thinking you're brilliant for that uh when it comes to foreign policy he showed us what that results in on the world scene you know it was a lot of strategic patience leading from behind a lot of fancy ways of saying\nDon't make any decisions just focus on the process lots and lots of processed lots of talk well turns out that if you are willing to tackle heart problems and make tough decisions you could

years Fox's Julian Turner was more\nDecision and the left media the legacy media in this country listens to what she has to say and it's like now giving her ... ... ... here's the odd thing I mean the whole thing is odd but it was among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody who's present it as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist honor all have a\nAn actor honor and I'll say this is an activity you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um here's the president's son ... you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor what that means is the person who's getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking never as good as they do\nBut they keep on presenting listen a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on it and USA Today I've I'm confused why are we doing a story and a list of a lotto\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment\nThen\nChristie lousy forward would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment and she's never really said why and again I don't really care why ... why she is not an expert\nI talked about this by talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes and people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or the big screen for a long time\nAnd we share our cells well we were you for some reason project intelligence\nOn them a list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue she has yet\nTo make a point that makes sense you have to do a legacy media keeps putting up on high because a she's attractive\nAnd be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out there like a like me to buy use it as far left wing garbage\nListen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't up\nTheir side they think she does but she doesn't when was the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way\nLookout dumb that's the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman goes every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\n\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually at this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously\nBut you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or you read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe a list of all I Do because fill in the blank\nJust doesn't happen oh another trendy thing

the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee for vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened\nAnd in our show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and are you hoping you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream later and watch it because the sheet ... beautiful in Alaska but do we do with boys and girls who served ... how are ya\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole for Black Friday [laughter] and the people know I was actually and this was unfolding on me or love you are listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said Hi Sarah pale in a bigger kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening is what is a good point they should ... you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was you remember what you said you said\nIt's really me I promise [laughter]\nTo go out\nAnd going back and forth and I can eat it oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and we get punk so thank you for doing that and know it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening [laughter] I get up and I'm like I Know what I'm trying to verify it me\nWhile I tried to verify interview ways when I got the email back from sure appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I said do you have an iPhone ... face time you must you settle this once in a row in as good as we got to figure so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd that's it and then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone work by that time out of the vehicle and we're all press the button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the button you took my time and very ... her son Tina Fey that's her that's my ... and not know you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski be became a senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says you couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\n[noise] no and go back even further\nWriting campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank Murkowski yeah after having served twenty two years in the U.S Senate he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on German and I ran against him into heated you haven't read that at least got and that's how we stayed in the central command once you're in and you have these special interests from\nAround the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she's daddy's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about calls like of course it is and whether either good matter\nYes I Do know that it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested as an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it comes down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you that you are you like wasn't up and I sort of a court of appeals in all ... opinion of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain was going to write a my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nSo and I think a lot of people actually did that the point of me friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe law issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every week it would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment check amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I Would go breath because nobody else was talking about that book share what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskan because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that I that was very very dangerous and the other thing is that Trump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing our ally in decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nThat's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five\nSelfless

a few years\nTo be honest with you and I think she's got some really good protection you know around her because I Want to be ever got her the word I had no clue she lives in my show every day and and I guess they hit the right buttons that one day and getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interviewing and hopefully we'll have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs native Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed that she is not who she told Alaska she would be when she said she'd be a Republican there is no reason for any Republican\nOr anybody who's a conservative a traditional American values person to say no to Brett Kavanaugh uncorroborated allegations don't count\nI'm innocent until proven guilty due process do count\nAnd and hurt no vote was a ridiculous boom\nAnd hope that people will ask are smart enough to get a rise out of there as soon as they can it is a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty will have energy

therapy that are trying to make this breed when your own trainer ask me what I wanted to talk about I mentioned that I read an article or some kind of go by couldn't validate where the article came from so I'm going to change my question to\nIn this election how do we check invalidate every person involved in counting Electra ... votes to make sure they can corrupt the actual vote tallies critical areas of our country\nWell allegedly there are checks and balances in place but I don't trust it a lot of his electronic voting um I I think is is scary because you can hack these machines I don't know how to do it but what do you know these these guys out there do know how to do it if you're going to happen during our government or hack into Facebook are\nHappy to fill in the blank Yahoo um if you could do those things actually do a lecture machine I Would think would be very hard um so I don't know how we guarantee that I got I got to tell you Doug I I've been voting for as long as I can remember and I can't tell you for sure that my vote counted every time I still go\nAnd I'll continue to go but we are leaving it to a very small number of people to validate something that\nThat we all hope will do that they'll get right\nIt's a great question I don't have a good answer\nAs fast you know all of a sudden it's about a whole box of votes were counted in critical elections and it's like\nOh well we have I I I'm guessing that you're you might be referring to Minnesota where Al Franken won and he shouldn't have but suddenly there were votes veterans somebody's car trunk\nIt just doesn't make any sense and it is it's a scary proposition although I Am bullied a little bit bother with the election results are twenty sixteen ... election that will that would have been the one but I think they let their guard down I ...\nThey let their guard down because they bought Hillary Clinton was going to win rather easily\nIt sounds like our votes Li do ... but it's a great

and a lot of travel is well we talked to about ... we're talking about liquefied natural gas would get him to an war as well uh ... appreciate you how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know Texas but it's a it's what I call temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected\nWith several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you and your uh uh globetrotters now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was going to entail owners\nAre not necessarily but\nUh what's happened is is the energy revolution a run his odds that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we are now\nSelling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent as groups and\nUh there there's more to be done so I'm being there uh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being later and making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and has a uh as as transparent as it\nCan be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied\nNatural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIs the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining ... putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time slabs\nLeaky you stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade him in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas now are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make it part of the deal how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause the secretary of treasury minutiae and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross gay all have a\nA a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's\nOn the same team I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary [laughter]\nThat's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young and came back in here or after they laid out some really tough ah a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs in retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know hedge blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of the Indian good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently\nAnd our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of a great job but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through\nBefore you can actually get to a source of use you when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it as these things were outdated you know think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is running side that was twenty five years ago\nAnd and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing at the energy sources that we were buying\nAnd now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different\nPositions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what

a website in college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on campus though Facebook is what they started getting rid of a judge made at Facebook\nThat you know blossomed into well yeah everybody wants to go meet hot guys and girls sure it would that would share picture to it\nOr was it was going to be able to connect to that and then it became a very powerful outlet it used to be that if you if you

being freed from two years of captivity in Turkey took time out to thank President Trump and members of Congress are fighting for his freedom\nNo I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and that's what they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you ought to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nIt's a Senator Ron Johnson resolutely right last question on cabin on automobiles to be on affordable healthcare act in in\nYou guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left is screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their mind for we're not going to kick them off the court 'cause we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been they've had this primal screams cents a day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you know I've never seen his like this job you know in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican race did Wisconsin let's talk about the an Affordable Care act you supported the president as it all Republicans and has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helped people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that taxing the an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case you were a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it\nA of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care planning ...\nFamilies who have their previous reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act reverse rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer Reno ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mom and care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current levels so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back\nAnd nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nThe Obamacare exchanges if you can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to somebody you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of coverage for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the bond care exchanges\nWe're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when women ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because we're on day one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base is that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if a if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects our pre existing condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nUh they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer government run bureaucratic system\nThat will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double and it's still wouldn't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down the number thirty two trillion\nThen realized how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson one last question are running and I always read the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly\nI feel strongly that knowing that the Senate stay with you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly\nBut the house is starting to look like it's up for grabs were this blue wave was being talked about for six months do you think that the moves by Avon audience Feinstein and and uh and Cory bookers barbecues and all these people in that process\nWhere you think that's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and vote November\nI sure hope so I don't I don't know ... what else what else can Democrats show the American public to just create the discussed again if you're not disgusted by their despicable ... behavior God help ya\nYa know I'm I'm with you and I think that it's going to be probably I'm a hearing people saying red dawn\nOn on on November ah six I'm not really sure what's going to happen other than people need to go and vote or else it surely will be some sort of a strange blue wave with impeachment talking all this other garbage Ron thanks a million for the time I always appreciate the knowledge and thank you so much for release straightening out with this individual health ah this individual's\nChoice and health care really is because the lies are going to continue for the next month and you know that\n... day review appreciate that Ron Johnson again he's a Republican senator from the great state of Wisconsin always great information and we always appreciate him taking the time your thoughts are that hopefully cleared some things up because there were some things in the media that just frankly only true\nThey just they just darn it is a
