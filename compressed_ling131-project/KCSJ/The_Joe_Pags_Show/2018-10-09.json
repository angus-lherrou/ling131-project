going into his second term after he beat Romney just thinking to myself what is it that so many of my fellow Americans do not understand that I had to wrestle with Adam grapple with it\nSo much of it was objects and so much of it was Romney's unwillingness to rise to the kind of fight he was in he didn't really understand Trump understands\nAnd he rose to this occasion soda Cavanaugh I was proud of both of them and proud to have defended both of them in this whole process\nBut the biggest takeaway for me from all of this is just how insane the left has become\nLet them has turned into a kind of mass panic a widespread delusion a collective nervous breakdown\nIt's no longer enough for people to disagree with others based on politics they have to shriek into this into the air\nThey have to bang on doors they have to attack old men holding signs they have to harass people in the streets chase them out of restaurants and threatening letters docks members of the Senate threatened the docks their shoulder\n\nThere was word over the weekend of senators who had been a deluge with threats against themselves against families against grandchildren of senators\nA Fox anchor was stocked into

protesters clawing like crazed animals at the Supreme Court doors\n\nAnd yes you even had Taylor Swift come out in favor of the Democratic party in Tennessee T swift how could you\nKnow this is very serious ah this is something quite different\nOr the left has lost it uh they they no longer seek to meet us on a battlefield of ideas where reason even plays a role nowadays emotion it'd slogans it is the mob not just cheering on one side\nBut demanding deal obliteration of the other demanding the arrest of political opponents demanded the harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in some cases for decades they don't want to just beat us on the battlefield of ideas they want to be just literally\nWith sticks and fish than rocks\nThey threaten violence because to them ideas that shattered their own sense of their worth and their wellbeing they are triggered by our our thoughts and that triggering they think\nJustifies a violent response we saw this in some of the antics of ... over the weekend attacking people on streets acting like the maniacs they are\nAnd we see this from the way that the less reacts to political defeat we want conservatives won the good guys one with capital\nAnd notice there's really not any gloating there's not an endless victory parade going on television there is in the sense of now that we've\nBeat the other side in the war let's go round in Bay and that all the survivors were not rubbing their faces in it although a little bit of spike no football perhaps as an order\nBecause to us this was just what shouldn't have been done this was just this was right life goes on there are other battles to fight there are other arguments to be had but also in the conservative mind today in America you can have a separation between\nWho you vote for what policies you support what you what you believe in your politics and who you are in your day to day life I don't mean that you don't leave your ideals and beliefs but I mean you don't feel the need to only exist in that fear of what his political\nTo be a good conservative you have to focus on things like\nShooting people with respect acting with honor and decency and kindness things that the leftist media tends to sneer at things that pop culture dominated by the left ridicules\nBut you realize that you can't be a true conservative without doing those things and it's just so much easier in so much more self gratifying so much more satisfying to the self\nTo show up and scream about how to have it all will be the death of millions of women just scream about how the patriarchy is alive and well dressed in stupid costumes and carry idiotic placards and act like the country is falling apart and democracies in peril\nBecause process is still respected in the Senate because the presumption of innocence is a principle that we have maintained understand this if they have gotten away with this plan if the left and managed to sink Kavanaugh\nIt was the beginning of the end of any kind of\nHonest forthright and decent discourse in this country\nBecause anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side anybody who was able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious mirrors and character assassination\nAnd there would have been this sense that\nOnce the allegation is out there that's all that's required the allegation he's the verdict\nAnd because they were deprived of that secret weapon because the less isn't going to be able to do that they had a complete meltdown click with all of it\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nI mean\nWe're talking about I mean I don't know\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\nThese people are on well\nIt's not just that I think they're wrong that their ideas are bad that they would be destructive to the country where there to be implemented that's given\nThere's something different now\nWe're not arguing over what the top marginal tax rate should be with the left today\nWe're not arguing over how we should pay for various health care entitlement programs although that's a part of the discussion that's not where the focus of the fight is now the main effort the central argument has to do with whether the last ... defeat\nWhether it can handle the fact that it's not always going to get its way and in fact the aid if you will of the progressive left right the ... the part of the mind that is where instinctive impulses lie\nSo I was like I said when they have on people with the ... science and they're down on Capitol Hill and they want to make sure that democracy is imploding from within and they want to smear the Kavanaugh ...\nThat that is apparently now not allowed any more you're you're not allowed to point out that the that that story I was just funny people\nThey're trying to claim that that is inherently admitted meanwhile if Tom's dire was wanting them conservatives would you would be just as quick to point that it doesn't matter what you're saying that they're getting paid these aren't normal people normal people don't do this\nDon't do any of it by the way they don't show up at this screaming at the Capitol and acting like a bunch of maniacs\nThere so there's just so angry over this and here's one theory as to as to why I have a lot of theories about this is good news I've got three hours radio every night to talk to you about it one of them is that I think that the progressive left\nWorries deep down somewhere they worry that we're not for the Supreme Court\nAh imprimatur\nOr is it him him premature [laughter] imprimatur on their policies and believe they could make the argument themselves they need a Supreme Court that will side with them because they had to live with\nJust making the case about this or that policy they worry not just that they could convince the American people but I think\nThey worry that they could even convince themselves\nThey need a super legislature in black robes to tell them that what they believe is right or else\nThey're shaking just a very core\nWhich is why they act out so [noise]\n\nSee news radio

important sure I'm not going to pretend like I'm\nNot also invested in the politics here of course I Am\nBut what was at stake here was so much more than that\nIt was whether we would reward the worst

walk past you you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this is following him down in the subway\nThis was way too close and I don't want anyone to lose sight of that it's not like this was the way was just going to be and the Democrats made a lot of noise but we all knew I was hearing from people with connections to the White House that they were very senior people in the White House when Trump\nPoll Kavanaugh's nomination the kind of people who Trump might have listened to you can probably think of some of the names I've heard from people who know very directly that there was a real whole Kavanaugh movement within the White House\nAnd not talking about from the media or even from random Republican members of Congress or none of them and the White House and it was close and that's why would Lindsey Graham bit it's easy now to see it and say oh well\nDid it really matter that Lindsey Graham jumped him when he did the answers abs so ...\nIf ... ... and also there's this storyline is pathetic more ironic story line\nAbout how Kavanaugh was to mean and his response and so he's not he's not judge like\nEven though he's been a judge for like over a decade and the D.C court of appeals he wasn't being a judge when he was in front of the Senate he was being accused of\nOf being a a predator and he was on the defense stand okay it was being treated like a a criminal even though it's a non criminal proceeding he wasn't being a judge human being treated like a criminal\nThe reason they're so upset though and that they would switch that narrative is that they thought they had him on the ropes they thought they were going to finish them off and Lindsey Graham along with Kavanaugh rallied but this was close and I think that that\nGets lost in all this and it also was not without consequences I had the opportunity to speak to our buddy to ...\nOn rising and that interview will be appearing tomorrow morning if you want to see it you go to heal the TV but I was able to speak about this a little bit and he made some important points I'm\nOne that it's not like there are not consequences for cabinet that came from this Harvard said that he's no longer allowed to teach because they they will once again at the academy they caved to the leftist mob this is how they do things their place Thirteen\nTime particularly outraged at my colleagues and students at Harvard law school those of them who have made it impossible for Kavanaugh to continue to teach their it's rampant McCarthyism at its worst reminiscent\nOf what I experienced what I was a student at Brooklyn College in the fifties where professors were fired because it was suspected that they went Seventeen or Twenty years old they might have been a members or fellow travelers are the Communist Party which is to have to put an end to this\nAs right this has to stop\nGoes ditches corrosive to politics this degrades and your roads political discourse and as for the for the left you
