I don't\nWant to say that that kind of behavior following senators or any other like that official into a restaurant and now with their family I don't agree with that I did not I I\nDon't know I I I Know you've got\nTo get out of line where or\nWhen we saw okay I've got to get to the break we'll answer your question the U.S or is it my behavior no it's not my right people who are upset and angry

conservative or never Trump Republican or whatever and his job he like I I Know because they wanted me to play the role and I wouldn't blame his job to just sit there and just get smacked around by I think there were four lives on that CNN panel including the host for lips and one due to that\nThat that like lab that they that well he's totally correct I mean I I give him credit for at least we want to say I don't see it but they act like it's ... now it's a question of the number one that got me my ... what do you mean it's a mob\nWhen you've got a big that's when you've got more than three people who are together screaming\nIn your face and acting like maniacs because they're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like your politics they don't like her political party that's getting into my behavior when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThat it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive\nAbout using that word they're very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives and they don't want the lives that feel like anyone standing and mean about the really devoted lives\nYou know there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that they despise anti fun fact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now who\nDon't necessarily agree with that he was methods but they agree with the message\nAnd they know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey are there are there's a problem on the left here and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it reminds me so very much of what was being ... of what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you guys know what I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these\nIncidents the most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri\nWhere are these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind\nAnd they were burning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analyst later on doing like well it was mostly peaceful protest it was the most peaceful protests\n... mostly peaceful protest what does that even mean\nIt can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire they were like oh my gosh look the country isn't in turmoil look at the rioters\nAnd yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of this black lives matter movement then all of a sudden\nYou know they're they're not ... you can't afford them is riders you certainly wouldn't ... what was going on even though it was about race and racial animus and claims of racism and never allowed to call it a race riot on TV\nBut that is what it would have been called decades before and if you were to look at what was happening yes a lot of times riots or follow on to demonstrations usually people have to get together first before they can be a big mob that's destroying things you could always have this\nA vanguard of\nThe ... the truth ... cheese and we think about even even terrorists 'cause I'm not saying although ... pretty\nMuch a domestic terror I mean they haven't killed anybody yet but they do attack people just wrote property I'm ... ... and I would note that they will count political violence especially if it means I can talk about like white nationalist they'll they'll say that somebody in writing a swastika reading some racist crack a crap somewhere is an act of\nOf of terrorism when they're counting it up or FBI purposes to make it sound like Islamic terrorism is not the only terrorism I thought the ... but then they won't say that what ... does which is explicitly destructive and violent behavior intended\nTo bring you know certain elements into the into a political conversation they won't call that they won't count that stuff is terrorists and they won't come out as a domestic or ... incidents\nThe support for those people support for that activity is I think what's so surprising that people that they will be hesitant to\nCall these groups chasing people a mob but in a political environment or Rand Paul's wife has to sleep with a gun under her bed because she's got a credible threat of her husband was shot at and almost beaten to death by left wing maniacs in an arm or Ted Cruz can have dinner with his wife\nEnvironment where administration officials are not just told they're not welcome in restaurants or chased out of restaurants because they happen to work for Donald Trump\nIn that climate which is where we are right now that the media would play this game of oh well let's not call them a mob why not\nAre you you're concerned about offending them oh no you're concerned about offending your audience who deep down Democrats are show enraged by their losses or so and raise the American people are not more on their team with\nAll of this that they wanted special birth they want special treatment even for the mob tactics of these angry

how that goes there is nothing that stops the D. O. J. from doing that there's nothing to stop them from doing it\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people who are operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits\nOn an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows but you do not have the right to be speeding investigation\nIn fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on end bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stop\nBecause they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about treading constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse of I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F Buckley style can serve I used to be the mind up you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of the capital and on any issue related uh Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the ... and we got our video J. really take a good look now that told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the what the deal Jay determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll bought no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that match\nThat must be the FBI by the way\nYou know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul is holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think they'd given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's where we ask you to get a warrant\nThe information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no constitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime\nAnd that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree\nI have to say it's a little concerning that given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these processes work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again\nYou don't remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party it is this all happened after we should have been aware that or political opponents in in our own country\nWe're willing to abuse the apparatus of government reporters and purposes and there's been no real change there's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government is full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\n\nSeem it as an honor and privilege to bring in

for the foundation for research\nEqual opportunities also a Forbes editor over great to have you say buck so a ... well first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are\nAre we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about Trump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the\nHouse in the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I've looked at it pretty closely at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now is motives motivating people to turn out\nAh for November of having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say this if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate if they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow what ever happened the midterms are gonna be over you know the FEC to your listeners know this was seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about the\nTwenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what's that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning ... you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election where is the last positioning itself but where Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nYeah one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this\nOn your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are they're\nTalking a lot about this Texas lawsuit which aims to overturn Obamacare the out by attacking with a preexisting conditions provision in Obamacare\nAnd so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because the pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that from me so there is a lot of these races a lot of talk about preexisting conditions in when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know why should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident of that\nI'm certain of it it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections and the last ten years right similarly\nProgressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party if you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge so every Democrat feels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen\nThey do philosophically would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not gonna they're not going to deny that therefore single air they're going to say yeah I'm for single or they're all going to climb over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that
