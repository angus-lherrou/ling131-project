in the game that you should be able to show on a federal income tax return that you paid I don't know a dollar\nA hundred bucks a thousand dollars I don't care you know I I don't know why why do why because I was\nI was on our work day thing today putting in some time for vacation which I never taking my end up getting screwed at the end of the year so I was putting in for some vacation time you know his notifications that I had not a downloaded my PBS for my patients\nSo it was I was waiting for a meeting to start earlier at noon today I just quickly downloaded a few of them and I looked at the last piece lip and I looked\nOver there to the federal withholding year to date\nAnd then I put the automatic a E D on to restart my heart if everybody had to pay federal income taxes have to show that you were actual tax payer then and only then would you get the vote\nThat we can't do that because well that's that's I was like a poll tax or something that's that's that's like a poll cat or a poll tax or a ... something like a poll dancer you make those poll dancers declare all the dollar bills get stuck in their G strings before they can vote yeah yeah I don't I wouldn't mind that\n\nIt's better than having dummies book is better than having people that do you mean sometimes\nNow if you can show that you don't pay any income tax because what you had enough right off because you lost your button the market that you lost your button and investment or something else I Would I Would accept that to\nJust stop and think about\nThink about how differently elections would be I'm not saying you have to own property not seen you have to own any personal property any real estate I'm just saying that you have to have done something that shows that you pay income tax\nNow what about the elderly what about somebody's on Social Security well guess what\nPeople are going to be careful here because some people collect Social Security and they never paid into the system but if you can show that you paid into the system as a wage earner somewhere or that some point you pay income taxes maybe you're retired now I'll give you a caviar I'll give you an exemption for that to let you vote\nBut just thinking about how differently it would be if we require people to have skin in the game before you could go vote for your city council your county commissioner your dog catcher or your US Senator\nBut now I mean I mean we done that individual income taxes with the federal government single biggest revenue source\nIn the fiscal you're twenty eight team which in September thirty the individual income taxes is expected to bring in roughly one point seven trillion dollars or about half of all federal revenues according to the CDO\nBloomberg looked into the two thousand sixty individual returns data in detail for some additional insight the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven percent than the bottom Ninety percent combined\nSo the top one percent\nPaid thirty seven percent of all federal income tax the bottom Ninety percent combined only paid thirty percent of all we can fix the top fifty percent of all taxpayers paid Ninety

predicting that could reach a trillion in two thousand and Nineteen what's going on with that\nBut it's very disturbing in pitch ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend every year\nRemember the fifty percent of the taxpayers are paying some I've already put it up some Ninety percent tax\nThose entitlement programs are redistribution program\nThe way Social Security Medicare and Medicaid oldies entitlement programs work today they're taking from all of those tax break the fifty percent that actually tell you something\nAnd they're taking that money and giving it to other people\nThat I Am not arguing that we need to take away grandma or grandpa dads Social Security or Medicare but what I Am or unions that we need to have some sort of cut off point where we recognize that we can't keep that sustainable and we need to do something different\nWhy doesn't that happen why is it that which is so obvious to you and me doesn't get a fix in DC\nSome people were just discussing the funding other government is about thirty percent of what was about how there's been a bipartisan reluctance to tackle entitlement changes but go\nA bipartisan reluctant mini both Democrats and Republicans don't want to touch the Republicans Democrats both want to kick the can down the road in fact they kicked the can so far down the road I don't I don't know if you can't even exist anymore\nIn the popularity of those programs though hopefully at some point here will get serious about this we haven't found yet\nAnd it would appear if you kind of look at the chilies that divided government might actually yield to entitlement reform or at least make it easier\nWhen we had that opportunity during the Obama years I talk about a number of times I Would have been a perfect time to do it think of Reagan and Tip O'Neill coming together in the early eighties raise the age for Social Security it took it out of the political arena and made it possible for it to be a successful [noise]\nThat's what we had the chance to do during the Obama years when we had divided government

that is not enforced what happens\nWhen the state has decided their actions that are bad but there are no consequences for that bad behavior what we're seeing this happen right now\nIt is so very easy for Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats who don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs who don't have to worry about illegal immigrants uh and draining\nResources from over already overcrowded public schools public schools that are attended by Americans of all ethnic backgrounds of all religions\nThey don't have to worry about that doesn't affect them in fact\nThey view it as nothing but win win by being essentially for open borders from Latin America at least in this country to Democrats get to feel morally superior\nThey get to achieve power and perhaps even eventually\nDefeat the Republican Party for ever by changing the demographics of this country such that there'll be a majority\nOf voters built in for always and and forever for the foreseeable future least who vote Democrat\nBecause they know that immigrants particularly that all of the people well [laughter] the illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for members who really knows what's happening there uh but but immigrants in general uh tend to vote Democrat and\nPeople who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of big government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stopped we can't keep doing this the answers to it it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up this problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe understand is a very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this and we would like the president to take the falling actions no they want to point fingers and screamed racist and they want photos of crying children being separated from parents they want photos of\nPeople looking hopeless and indigent being told by immigrations and Customs Enforcement or being told by border patrol in this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody\nAnd they hope to make this an emotional issue\nIf it's really that emotional for them why don't they just make the case that the imagery makes for them which is well I guess we should just taken everyone\nAnd everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and who have respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have you and MSNBC CNN New York\nTimes Washington Post in their corner so they don't count this is very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances than it was just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a\nPolicy we will be in different countries different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes you cannot have open borders and a welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows is no other country in the world takes in a million people and make them legal and God Bless him welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nSo a lot every year working in a million through our legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from I think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand\nOh my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing can the number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president I can do anything and if we have Trump even an office for if we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of current migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want it though because Wal\nFirst off would prove its utility very quickly and then they do look foolish or walls don't work no pretty sure walls work\nYou know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property and has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking out of their property and trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they said oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works so why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any answers for you\nThey just don't want to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an on fulfilled promise now as to who's\nBehind this march and who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I Know I I don't know\nBut I Do know that this is not a coincidence that you have the largest of these migrant caravans that I that I Know of\nJust a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border this allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things

I think that's fair what the heck is he talking\nAbout democracy that you know we were going to hand or children ... what does that mean\nThis is my favorite question to ask people on the left his what what are you really saying what does that mean how is it in power were about to have a big election and a lot of people are going to vote one way and a lot of people are going to one another way what what is the peril democracies in right now this is like when people say oh the first amendment is under threat by Trump how\nBecause he uses the first amendment do we ever get to hear an explanation of this is just rhetoric it's just empty it offers nothing it tells you nothing just democracy is not a spectator sport gee that's brilliant maybe you could put that on a mug and give it to somebody\n\nWhere do we find these Democrats\nPoor show sanctimonious so full of demagoguery and don't add anything to conversation there are interesting liberals out there they're fascinating left it there are people you can talk to I I Know people were anarchist and I love talking to you I Know people that have all kinds of really interesting belief systems in\nAt least it's worth engaging you

why there's such a desperation and why they're being violent either attacking people either hurting people\nBecause they've got nothing\nI mean they have the usual slogans and the class warfare and all that but I mean in terms of candidates in terms of a bench\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families\nYou know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic incoming are actually trying it now in a a drawing in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all the news get people angry by telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are\nI think there are also in a bit of shock and this is where I'll talk to you a somewhat about the the Kavanaugh effect which is very very real these senators\n[noise]\n\nThere's one question on the\nDoes the country want to put a check on Donald Trump\nDo we want to put a check on Trump is\nDo we want to repudiate it or do we want to validated because should the Republicans\nMaintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate president will not only be unchecked\nHe will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing is stoking hold civil war in this country ... the American people use that President in the history of the country who makes new preach about being the leader of the American people here the leader\nIn the theater\nMSNBC political analysis of such crash see Schmidt\nIs among the very worst we'll talk more about it he's going to get another parents later the show he does the dumbest stuff on TV so that means that you know fun to use them for commentary purposes they put them on TV a lot of MSNBC though\nWhat are you saying isn't true by the way what he's saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of ... or something but it's not just trumpets on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not a the Republicans are not\nTreating it as old as only Trump on the ballot first of all every single congressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that should you think a guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that out\nBut beyond that there's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last couple of weeks last few weeks that could change this election much how you got it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I I had a I had a chat with a Lindsey Graham last night spoken for about twenty minutes we sat down we're over Fox and I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe cabinet effect is very real Lindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh\nBut here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game you know Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather uh the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging his health care health care health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling shows that that actually for the people were going to vote that matters to them\nRepublicans do have had a gift recently\nAnd what you see is that the Kavanaugh effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is that's not gonna fly that's not going to work\nUm the dynamic of this playing out right now is the uh the\nDynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think it's really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the needy because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in a elections that are in states where it's kind of a ... a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a\nOf a close circle all across the board they want people to come and speak\nAbout the cabinet issue what Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nSo in very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting and Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great\nBut in states where it's a closer call or it's a little more purple where there you're going to have the Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did a Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority now already have all the lives the American people and cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court seat from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop it just due to a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is dating anticipate that in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women\nAre scary is about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if you're somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know ... with some of what Trump is dawn ... but you're you're a a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this house contest it's going to be down to the wire\nThis is going to be really close I think could still go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still\nHappen and\nIt's going to be because if Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh\nWas critical [noise]\nGot a couple of it in my

if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to say where can I say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely how how you got it [noise]\nAh so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet um but I Do think that there is a very real\nPossibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one 'cause they're going to say that it's just something that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and ah there'll be better in the future or something like that\nAnd got to remember the Saudis\nAre in the region are pretty important player for us play a clip sex as secretary of state Pompeo again\nTitle for the Trump warning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have some understanding of the ... which one we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nIncidents rounding up I think it's worse for the number two we have long said neither do too long relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nThat continue to be in for the kind of terrorism\nTested it with the two holy sites\nForeign she's you\nKnow why is the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that we want to just discount just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and\nMake some big statement here there are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can make all of at our problem I Know that there's symbolism ear to journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however\nAnd so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative team and last\nOne the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish ditch\nTurkish sovereignty or I mean it's on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already be an investigation that is highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get it how we get it but if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were\nBrought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak vice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences political ten oh I can tell you\n\nIt was mentally\nIll I began\nHim who will be on\nThere will be consequences the vice president says notice that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences would\nBe and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nAnd what would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want to major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually\nA revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt\nThey're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women who go to school at all these ... which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean is going to be a really big step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power let me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and\nI Would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the clerics that are allowed to preach in Saudi ...\nYou're right now only do so with the acceptance and the and he said so of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario is one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them is because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario that the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel\nAnd then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not for the wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam ... they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems are and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping the place doesn't collapse into some kind of ethnic\nCivil war and you got it wrong clearly is not really fond of the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government\nBecause it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say we want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh\nGetting shifted around and one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing\nHow these these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them the Chinese people with the loudest voices on this do not have\nAmerica's interest necessarily at heart\nWe are one people we are the American people and when you say a president in the United states
