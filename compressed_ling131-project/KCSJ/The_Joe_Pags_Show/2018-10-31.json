new stalk five Ninety to see us Jay\n[noise]\nI'm John Caldera we've got eight minutes of the top ... funny evening thank you for spending some time with us hey\nI'm going to do my political stuff now sorry about this you know politics is local we can't save the nation until we save Colorado\nI dedicated the last Twenty years of my life to that proposition\nAnd as the left is understood how to take over the Colorado how to do it bit by bit by building out their machinery we have to do something else [noise] we've got to counter them and we counter them\n\nBy getting involved politically we're never going to be able to match them dollar for dollar we're not going to be able to match them\nFootsteps for footstep and what I mean by that is they have so many entrenched interests on the spending side that they have not just the money to win so many of these races but they have the foot soldiers they have the unions they have the kids they have the environmentalist they have\nAll the people that can go out and knock on doors we will never have that advantage because our team we're too busy working to make the tax money that will go to help\nEverybody else so\nSince we're not on the taking side of the equation were on the go tax us side of the equation and it's\nIt's really difficult\nFor us to get politically involved we don't have time we've got we've got a life we've got kids we've got family and we make our money by ... juicing things in the private sector not by taking things from the public sector\nSo of course they have they have an incredible advantage\nWhat are we going to do about it\nWell the first thing we need to do is just one vote\nAnd I'm Amazed at how many people haven't so I've been keeping an eye on the amount of ballots that have been returned so far and so far we\nWe compare to two thousand and fourteen more ballots have been returned in Colorado why compare it to two thousand and fourteen not two thousand and sixteen well two thousand and fourteen was a midterm election the last midterm election\nSo it's the one worth looking at\nAnd back then\nRepublicans came out earlier that is Republicans have a tendency to vote earlier Democrats in unaffiliated some people call them independence tend to vote later this time around it's the opposite\nCompared to twenty fourteen there are more unaffiliated and more Democrats voting\nThan there were four years ago does that concern you concerns me it means\nFewer conservatives are voting as a proportion of voters compared to this time four years ago the last the last midterm election\nThat doesn't mean we're going to lose but it means if we don't get out and vote we're going to lose and\nThere are such important things on the ballot not just the governor's race which is crucial but the ever important state Senate you understand the check and balance to a potential governor polish good try that went on for size governor polish\nThe\nCheck and balance to that is a Republican state Senate and right now today Republicans have a lead by one vote\nThat's it one vote if they switch that one Senate seat over to the other side it means a potential governor polish could have\nA Democratic House a Democratic Senate\nAnd then him\nBy the way this is not the Democrats of yesteryear that were mostly agricultural guys no no no the days of of declaring even even Roy Romer a garden these guys in the state legislature now where Democrats are hard edge command and control\n\nProgress is there is no part of our lives they can't direct better for us than we could do for ourselves\nThat's what they think\nThat's like getting out and voting is so very crucial this year\nAs it is every year Mike Coffman is in\nThe fight of his life now he's been in fights for his life before but never before has he been by nine percentage points in the polls\nHe's been down by other percentages without that high\nWhat a shame it would be if we were to hand Nancy Pelosi control of the United States House of representatives because the people of Aurora oh the sixth congressional district just couldn't get their stuff together enough to reelect this man\n\nAnd how crazy would it be if it was the Republicans\n... ... I\nDon't think that Mike Coffman is you know Republican enough and so therefore they just didn't get out the vote\nThat's what's at stake face up to you you can you can go one way or you can go the other but just so you know\nThe control of the United States Senate the control of the future of Colorado is laying on your kitchen counter yet that ballot in when you do that vote for one oh nine trust me on this one I'm John Caldera\nBaby Casey this J.\nSprings Colorado is news dependable accurate valid [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey and Jerry yesterday\nOn my heart radio or tell your Google Assistant okay Google like five Ninety case yesterday on I heart radio all your favorite music all your favorite stations like us all three of my heart radio dry at you like it on your smart speaker news dot by Ninety KCBS Jay\nHey guys don't mind the interruption to this radio program let's talk about male performance in the bedroom a subject that millions of guys ignore but in today's demanding world you just can't if you've tried ... or other male enhance it tells that just don't work\nListen to the following important message and get your act together now you need to try not to ... the superdelegates designed to transform your performance in the bedroom once and for all what's so good about\nOxygen it's been developed any us FDA labs with the highest quality ingredients to increase blood flow fast taken inexperienced strong explosive results and there's no side effects just imagined by ... on steroids so now to find out how to get a free bottle we recommend you use Knoxville extracted thinking their partner we certainly don't\nTo find out how any by ... you know at least ... times ... ...\nWhy so yesterday\nOf course include person born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of persons\nThat's right notch foreigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion\nBut it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and there were dropping this amendment it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are\nIn the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity in some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child is this has led to some open it outright scams other system\nMost notably with the citizenship\nOr you know or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nThere have been all stories on this we're in California in particular you have people from each day\nYou know who will fly to California and stay in a specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is that the they're\nWhen they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to let's say mainland China or wherever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older\nThey already have citizenship well gee that's that's a pretty that's a pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snatched for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it\nThan that and\nWe obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut all of it as a citizen right all but this person to citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation\nOf law and they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure overrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interests of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country or another that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states\nAre inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time and just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist\nAnd then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here\nWhat Democrats really what the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person has citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely\nThat later on that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now have you come from ... to the United states you are waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status you around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family reunification migration a chain migration to bring interest the family in the oil but it was at one kid in America I Know you're already at the front of the line\nWhen it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child it's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nOne in five and twenty fourteen seven hundred and Ninety One thousand a birth in the United states were to in immigrants whether legal or illegal and illegal immigrants counted for\nSeven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams bleed the three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United states but it's not just a three hundred thousand or so remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now\nIt's a three hundred thousand plus then the likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here legally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families\nSo forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family for a for a legal immigration system\nAh forget about that right because now it's you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of\nCourse you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor baby I it it's essentially gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit by his parents doing something that is\nA illegal right across the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe it but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law so they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of oh wow if immigration and Customs Enforcement later tries to deport\nThe parents they're breaking up families Trump says he's gonna handles with an executive order is that the right way I mean probably not from a\nPerspective of separation of powers of the constitution there are some\nDecisions although not particularly robust ones that look at the issue of who's a who's a ... a who's a citizen subject the jurisdiction there of and there were some complexities the nineteenth century around this because of Native Americans and whether Native Americans were subject to Native American jurisdiction not not us federal jurisdiction um\nBut the courts have never really weighed in on this in a clear fashion so yes Trump's executive order on this should have get signed should he do it will clearly be challenge right away by the never Trump judiciary\nAnd quite honestly would probably be challenged regardless of whether it was even Trump who did this it's not just this is not a trumped arrangements syndrome limited issue\nBut it will get fast tracked I think to the Supreme Court and then they will have to weigh in on this and then we will find out if in fact the Supreme Court\nWants to reward people for breaking US law and make sure that there is a clear plan to change the political and demographic realities of the United states through continued loopholes in the immigration system because it benefits Democrats\nThat's we're going to find out and by the way at the Supreme Court rules against this and says that birthright citizenship is no longer or rather if you're born in this country or no longer going to be an automatic\nCitizen what does that say about the scan the Democrats have been running with a lot of Republican complicity I might add all this time\nWhat does that say about what's been going on if that is that really isn't a valid interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and of of what's currently on the books in terms of the constitution so we really so the American people really would have been scammed all this time\nWhen you look at this we are the outlier there are roughly thirty\nCountries in the world where if you're born in them you get citizenship automatically the only ones that are that are developed world or the U.S and Canada no European country does this for example not\nPittsburgh following Saturdays synagogue shooting the trumps pay

position but\nYeah there's some people that are at least making a you know going through the motions of being not completely insane leftist\nBut then you see what ends up happening or you see what happens with the candidate you see what happens with the supporters uh you know ...
