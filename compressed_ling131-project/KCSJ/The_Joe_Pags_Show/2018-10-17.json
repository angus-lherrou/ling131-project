still a sense of nationhood of nationalism should I say\nWhere you want to you know I I Want to help Americans first if we're gonna have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were Americans\nAll races grades and colors help them if they're down on their luck and we're going to have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up
