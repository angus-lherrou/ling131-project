conversation now today\nToday we had a the Monday after all the Sunday shows\nAnd I look forward to what happens on the Sunday shows because we can get a couple of things in our minds if you watch the Sunday talk shows many meet the press and ABC's This week and Fox News Sunday and even the thing over at CBS\nSo that nobody watches and Jake Tapper you can kind of get an idea\nWhat the talking points are from both sides of the aisle\nAnd yesterday Lindsey Graham was doing ... duty getting out there making what I Would consider a primary ... case against the Democrats and exposing what they have done the despicable approach they took on trying to block judge Kavanaugh at all costs\nSo I'm a I'm Amazed amazed at what I saw I Lindsey Graham just lifted my heart last week when he made that\nStatement saying what a weasel the Democratic side of the aisle he turned into and how they treated judge Kavanaugh and if you watched the Sunday talk shows I was going to say that it was the greatest episode of meet the press ever\nBut I don't know if anybody will get the joke yesterday was the single best episode of meet the press that I have ever seen no nobody well it wasn't on last week because uh\nThe Ryder Cup match the golf match preempted it so that's why it was the single greatest episode\nEver but the the terminology that has shown up\nIn the language of the left when it comes to blocking judge Kavanaugh now let's go over some of the arguments that they have a brought up to block Kavanaugh one of those arguments was well he's going to ah he's going to overturn roe overturn roe v way\nThat was the first one they said we can't have that she's going to overturn roe v way and then after the meetings\nWith judge Kavanaugh and some of the testimony it seems like you know maybe he's not going to come in with a judicial prejudice and and look to overturn roe v white so they they shifted gears and then suddenly\nAt the end of the hearing process they came up with this accuser and the anonymous accuser that Dianne Feinstein at Santa for six weeks\nAnd so we said wait a minute we're going to question his character from thirty six years ago on we then discovered how many holes there were in the story of professor Ford\nAnd then over the weekend after the testimony and I was in DC last week I saw block\nOn Thursday we ran into each other the book party for a friend of ours I was in D.C to cover the or the hearing and the protests and then last week when they look like despite all the obstruction than deflection and and all the moves that were being made by the left\nThat judge Kavanaugh was going to push through and we would still have this week long investigation which everybody knew everybody and the dog knew that the Democrats who were going to complain that week\nWas not enough they started shifting the narrative and listen to your friends listen to your friends on the left who are saying they're using the phrase the wrong temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\nHe has the wrong temperament this is being said\nBy virtually every single one of the pundits it's being said by the senators the or the Congress people on the left and are bringing it up and you will hear the parrots from the left on Facebook and Twitter bringing it up he's the wrong temperament and SNL which will get into\nThat so now when after Kavanaugh and ... and everyone's saying he was yelling I'm Sorry he wasn't yelling if that's what you called yelling\nYou're ignorant\nAnd let's not forget a week and a half ago when a judge Kavanaugh was interviewed on Fox News they said oh at least two robotic he's he doesn't have a motion and then when it comes out in defends himself and his family he's called too emotional he doesn't have the right temperament\nThey're even now pulling the card if a woman had done what judge Kavanaugh dad\nShe'd be called hysterical and not the good hysterical you know the the craziest there will get into that a little bit but it got to check in with one of the buck family on the phone from Alabama Solomon checking into the evening Solomon welcome to the bucks sex and show how are you\nDoing fabulous I'm Glad

movies but\nI asked John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer because I'm no fan of humor he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and he always said the Robin Hood saw into wearing what he said today about the judge dairy said that he was a\nYou know deeply deeply part is saying and is there any as a candidate notice judge from a carrot a Chuck Schumer has got a big mouth and if we don't get our little boat\nAnd we don't you know get out there for the midterms in late ... try\nAnd keep things the way they are if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're gonna have to hear his mouth for the next God only knows how long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be Schumer and Pelosi so these are ...\nThat's another one like you hit the nail on the hat\nThese are two very scary realities people and we have to make sure that you take
