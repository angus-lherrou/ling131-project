documentary and so we need All right yeah\nWe are making our big push to recruit carrying positive adult role models right here in Pueblo to spend one hour week with a struggling middle school student in our United Way middle school mentoring program\nOr what are the qualifications or what do we need\nWell you just have to have the listening here you have to be a positive adult role model course pass a background check so but when we ask that you spend an hour a week with a student and one of the five middle schools that were at and that you listened that you provide that support\nInformation and advice on life skills that you can share and the hours typically around the lunch hour so if you're working individual and you can get out for lunch\nAt spend quality time we've seen that it really makes a difference in the student achievement in academics in their behavior attendance but what's harder to measure but we really see a lot of strides with is in their school engagement and our overall self esteem 'cause ... do you remember when you were in middle school\n... horrible so horrible yeah\nIt just makes me feel sick when I think about it and so so many of these kids are they just come from families that maybe they don't have support or maybe it's a single family household and they need that additional\nPositive adult role model is a little extra encourage me and it really makes a difference and it's a bond that's forged um that I think is not only benefit beneficial for the mentor and also the person doing the volunteering\nOkay well I'm thinking back eighth grade that was what the toughest three years of my life [laughter] ... yeah so you're looking for people from all walks of life yeah rug all walks of\nLife as we we are really putting a target on business people and the reason is is just people that are in the workforce but will we love retired people as well is that so they can explain and demonstrate how school help them and their specific\nJob because if you remember in fifth grade you're like what the heck does algebra happened in New York I live I still think why\nWhy I think oh I should have paid more attention in algebra I couldn't figure out how to lay this would've madly so it's really\nKind of to show the students at how school goes into future life and in their jobs and and just not only that but just life skills player you know how you become more organized the kids in the program are smart kids that's for sure you just need a little bit of\nHelp to them chewed up not yeah may maybe I give them advice on how to be more accountable responsive but these are smart kid they just need a little ... and all of you you're thinking I Know it when you open up the paper you're\nOut there thinking how can I help him ... view this is a great way to do it one hour week during the school year it's safe it's monitored and we do field trips to as well to create Bonnie this is a way that you can make a meaningful impact in our community because this is our future and you\nKnow I Know in the past you've needed more males is that still the case yeah\nWe typically need about sixty percent males and forty percent females because we we see that that typically mostly in in that's the breakout because just the\nPolitical building the green home\nMiddle perfect time to talk about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider you've all over the\nWhole city or\nThe blaze you know they need a little bit of extra help so we need a lot of men that are willing to step up and and be that positive male adult role model but of course we we use females and our gladly are able to accept them\nNow if somebody wants to do this well how do they sign up\nSo I'm going to direct them to our website blow United Way dot\nOrg slash mentor information there they can sign up they can apply and again you just have to pass a background check we do an interview with the perspective mentors just to line them up with the students that we think they'll let you have and then we do a training just to give a\nProse on and plates on how to best interact with the kid but if you can listen you can do that so it's not a tutoring program it's just that positive\nAdult role model ... which we all probably have some were in our past\nYeah if you look back you know we all know there's somebody that made a difference even outside of our parents teachers yeah church something and I still have\nMentors and if I didn't have mentors I I just can't imagine you know where my life would be so they they'll always make an impact\nWell there you go if you uh feel that in your heart again but we're not away dot org ...\nSlash mentor yet you can go on their check it out and we're happy to answer any questions as well or they can give us a call at two two five eight five eight zero as well\nUh but lots of information on on the website and we'd love to have it'd be a part of our mentors are amazing people they're all busy they're all care and and for them to donate their time is really humbling\nAnd mentors I've talked to their rewarded as well they feel great about it the hate to see the end of the school year\nDo they do so yes we really encourage if you want to make a real difference in public view the United way middle school mentoring programs the way to go\nA Judy details you can even call here will get you hooked up

which decided to go after told them six years ago when he made a fairly\nInnocuous yet stupid statement about right\n\nI certainly don't think it was worth deep six seeing a Tea Party candidate because doing so gave us Claire McCaskill\nAccording to the federal is one of the Web sites that we all read Remington research group is founder of the one thousand five hundred and fifty five likely Missouri voters survey late last week forty eight percent said they were planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley\nSix forty six percent were planning to vote for McCaskill\nBut even though that's probably within the margin of error\nThe problem from McCaskill is that her opposition to Kavanaugh\nIs one of the deciding factor for voters to come out against her\nWhy forty nine percent are saying that it's just that it is affecting their decision only forty two percent only forty two as opposed to the forty nine said that McCaskill's opposition to Kevin all our motivating their support\nMore people are being motivated to come out and vote against Claire McCaskill because of her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nAs she's in a hotly contested race\nSupport for her Republican opponent has beginning to search the real clear politics poll average puts holy headed McCaskill by one point and shows that the grace has grown increasingly competitive as we get closer and closer to November\nIvy Heitkamp North Dakota same thing\nA majority of North Dakota support the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nHeidi Heitkamp voting against him to find yourself in a

I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she thinks raped her\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nShe doesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she's claimed that she was drugs but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this party by the way I don't believe she ever even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete\nAn author I Know this is a fabrication now does she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in the Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense\nShe went from saying in this interview that Kavanaugh's spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of lemons but but I mean everybody's getting drunk these are high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little adding a little a boost to it to make a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't ruin the the big bowl of punch because that means he be roofing himself and all the other guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you have to drink from that too it's a bad idea ... story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication though that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did this that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated it's you can't keep it straight she claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they ...\nI went to a a Catholic school or private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and not really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's change things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\n\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of capital she's in her twenties and she's going to parties uh Fifteen or sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls are being roof eat and raped gang raped\nThe call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and would\nBe in a much stronger position to take action or would futile much stronger position socially when they're part of you know Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought you know I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with them is just on the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying\nIn an interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster anyone still believes this really turned into an intelligence test\nBecause you can't J.

I Know they're talking to mark judge now the FBI is going to go into remarked at work I didn't tell them exactly what he's already written down and just warn statement\nI don't know this woman I don't know what she's talking about this didn't happen cabinet never did this she's like basically\nThat's what you can say about Ford maybe afford Ramirez and sweat Nick ... is the one who says that maybe maybe he\nKavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask them what they think\nThat's not that's not something that\nInspires confidence in her telling of events is it\nCan't be sure exactly but you know it might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some roommate or doesn't like look you could find people in college I didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever to trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college if they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you were conservative everybody\nLoves to bash among conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think ... realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more\nTransactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for her forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the\nPast so\nThat's that's part of my concern ... and then you also have this is continuing narrative in this ties into what I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch for flake you see they can't get Kevin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person the Kavanaugh was of all the gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence running this because there is no evidence\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there is the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy or taken down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight you lose the Donald with ... cabin all true ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's been a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need and had the island nation because there are a lot of allegations reports really are about how it is\nSo that is very relevant and the trail of himself as actively choir boy or is there much contradicted by it may sound mind college as long as people and and I go why we need an FBI and the reason why I'm calling from one\nFor like five\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that center who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\n\nWe need an FBI investigation that cab and all because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron\nReally don't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator or she can't be that\nShe can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher nope you're up in our ...\nTotal and missile total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a front row and he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitutional is and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four or whatever it was no that's not serious New York times doing a peace right now on how he was part of a\nLike party planning or something back in the day in New York Times doing that bees whoa oh gosh and he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and\nHis social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any this happened she came out and said she opposes and because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights I'm short too of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nLook by creating this storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree by the lakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for cabin office has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open the storyline you see how it goes all we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented part as an assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them and the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing\nAll that lake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's gone up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing\nKnowing that yes you'll receive a lot of viciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger it's not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice\nReally from people but\nHe's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big\nHouse that's that's what flakes game last year\nOr so that's why I'm I'm concerned I I don't know how the votes will go I'm not I have zero confidence in the ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it because\nIt is salacious that you could definitely say it is it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but it did\nI I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man or their things in there essentially telling you to sweat Nick is a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's that's\nThe bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard this line you know how many women have\nTo be assaulted before you believe women\nDish is a this is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach you're a collective\nVersion of justice or a collective based approach adjusted that's at the heart of all this I Want to address that when we come back and they don't talk about the mid germs and where I think this is going in terms of red wave blue wave all that stuff third our going into the
