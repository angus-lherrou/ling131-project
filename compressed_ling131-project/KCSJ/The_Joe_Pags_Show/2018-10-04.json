I saw how to\nAnother sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties where there was drinking insects and and knew the cabinet was that these parties I mean at what point are we just put it in high school drinking and socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here ... there there is no names there's no allegations of specific criminality oh yeah I Know I I I'll swear I'll swear testimony out that I went to a party a long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not gonna get in trouble for perjury and also doesn't prove anything they ... it was election I keep I keep running into they should be ashamed but are they have no shame and they view this as an end justifies the means such a situation and\nThat's why I Want to remind everybody right now\nWe've got to keep our eye and the ball here\nThis has never been this has never been about getting to the truth this delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense\nThis has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what this is\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time is going to pass\nBetween now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom enough they haven't done enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to\nThis is where I'm most concerned as to how I could see a vote\nFailing or the Senate not having the votes one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this brink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb if Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside\nHere so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to position themselves\nFor maximum political benefit around Trump oh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing a there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as came across to me it's very strange it a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going on in the media and saying well well I was I had a sexual assault in my past or I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes\nEthically am a ... completely on cannabis unacceptable position that will lead to monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegations\nThat's not the way the system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed but this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this Kavanaugh versus Ford\nSituation will notice the second or the second allegation firmer mirrors and the third from sweat neck they barely even discussing that anymore\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying as we found out what they're mere as and in the third case with sweat Nick it's an intelligence test watched that interview with Julie sweating ... where she's talking about gang rape and being\nIn in community college and hanging out with high school kids and all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful\nDon't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth if you think she's being truthful your your skills of discernment and analysis our ah our ally\nGetting to say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the damage here don't be fooled\nFor a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big after some whole there's women who were lying or we believe the second and third of lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is also honest\nI have a hard time believing that now we can speak honestly and truthfully about what has been said to us in the last week in week and a half\nAnd\nWe need to understand that Democrats aren't just relying on that in order to take down Kavanaugh now it's going to be all we need bipartisanship oh\nThere's a temperament issue here as we discussed yesterday it's about it's about Kavanaugh's character you see\nThey're stuffing his background this is the latest just breaking before I came on the air the ... the Senate with Feinstein includes just you're basing themselves for the amusement of the ... cat wearing lunatic left\nThey're saying now that will be background investigation information from Kavanaugh six other background checks that's where the real mother lode is\n\nLet's talk about this and and much more aid for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred bucks team we have a jam packed show right back on the radio\nI died yesterday\n\nEverybody is ... and I'm here in Studio in the free them up with mark Bachmann the c._e._o. of global verification network\nYou know mark when people hear about vetting and background investigation services they may not really understand the full scope of what you do like it's not just employers it's also property owners who can use your services tell me how that works\nThat's that's on whether you think it's unfortunate behavior or not I mean whether you think it's a big deal or not that's pretty common place among\nMillions and millions of Americans and Democrats the party of bill\nClinton and Ted Kennedy all of a sudden being Puritans my gosh alcohol and like men and women mixing of parties\nThat seems to me to be just as as brazen a as a ...\nBut they're saying here that the information and he's six background investigations that have already happened that's what has to come out now also note that blog the Fords lawyers will not hand over her polygraph examination notes or her therapist notes until she gets to speak to the FBI\n[noise] here we go again why is the wise blah Z for why does she require speaking the she already gave her statement under penalty of perjury\nTo the house the Senate Judiciary committee so why does she need to give the saints she's going to give it ... if she gives a different statement to the FBI\nThen she's lying and we've got a big problem that she's in criminal jeopardy so she's not going to give a different state than the FBI so what's with this only give you information the FBI oh that's right more excuse more complaint more delay\nWhich is the name of the game which is why flakes all thing I always found out since the ... was that we should have had the vote last friday in the lake is a moron that's what we found out that's all we found out so far there that that the information that's come to light has just been\nFurther evidence that cabinet law should have gotten his vote last week when they plan to do it and this was not healing the nation at\nAll and I'm telling you they've got something else it's going to hit tomorrow [noise] they're going to put something they're they're cooking something up behind the scenes I I I don't know exactly what it is but I think it's going to be about something unrelated to sexual assault now\nThey're going to say the Kavanaugh was an alcoholic or something like that just look in his ... and oh by the way he lied about being an alcoholic the proof\nIs in the record that the public's not supposed to be able to see [noise]\nThe news radio I'm Brian shook six law enforcement officers are being treated for gunshot wounds and another officer
