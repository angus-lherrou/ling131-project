shouldn't get too enamored with the notion of having a very prominent wealthy black celebrity like ... so friendly and familiar with the president and working with him on policy issues by the way you know you you can say this about a lot of people in a lot of different situations are we allowed to embrace that he's\nSaying things that we like and pushing ideas that we liked now or do we have to say well a long time ago he he had or even ten years ago whatever was he had a different perspective so would that invalidate same now that's not a standard that we hold any once you've never mind to a celebrity\nSo you know there's a little bit of I don't know if you'd say trust but verify but there's some applause with caution here I think in order for the whole Conyers situation and then there's also the everybody just needs\nTo calm the hack down our meeting was acting like Trump went and play Eighteen holes with Kim Jong on which let's be honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some\nCrazy thing that he had ... talk to him and saying oh he profane the or profane the\nOffice of the presidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office literally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot more in a way of profane stuff\nThan have a guest who cursed but there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find\nI used to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that here's a perfect example of what I'm Talking about\nJohn of Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in the CNN and who was always treated with tremendous difference I mean they really love Donna Brazil at CNN so I was supposed to be there to get a buck slapped if you will\nBucks left gets book a book ... you know what I mean ... bucks left 'em and\nShe told me she interrupted be once and told me to stop interrupting her was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that but I was never impressed with her so she was treated out\nAnd she is treated out the following in response is kind of member this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember he got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following in response to this whole commenting today Kanye West has set us back one hundred and fifty five years\nWish Sojourner Truth could have met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap but let's meet ... election day by voting for Democrats I mean the the end of that is fine if she wants to propagandize were Democrats you totally free to do that\nBut just say that Conyers has set back uh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in her mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community set us back a hundred and fifty five years well this one does the math\nOn that it seems a bug she's making a pretty pointed reference there and\nHow is that what a reasonable rational person would say here you have a world famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the ... literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world this is a man talking about Trump now Tanya probably thinks he's the leader of the free world\nAmong other things among being a deity ah but there's no there's no way any ... normal human being could look at this and say yeah that's degrading for any group of people never mind for black Americans I mean this is this the oval office\nAnd I think that the way they get to this this is two fold one today they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also they don't really accept the Trump is the president they've they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions in the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nIt's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud\nOr he is a ... an interlopers he's a pretender the throne if you will and so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give president he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself\nAnd so if that where your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage or not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report is demeaning but do you want any normal person that's just crazy it's crazy\nThat is the most accurate way to describe it

ever have you heard that calming notion remember how long it's been since we've heard somebody talk highly that a problem\nIs not the way presidents have normally dealt with disasters test that contrast between the voice of Jeb Bush and the voice of President Trump at the rally has to make you feel this cannot be normal they allowed us to be normal we're losing our sense of who we are as Americans I kept saying over and over again that Teddy Roosevelt said\nThe wrath of democracy will founder if people in different regions different sections different races religions think of themselves as the other and that's what's happening now and we need leadership to bring that back together again\nThere's a Doris Kearns Goodwin\nVery celebrated in the presidential historian or something in the law\nTelling us about how about that they love to do that they love to put presidential historians on TV to talk about contemporary politics I always find them underwhelming just say the least and what they tell us about what's going on today\nIt's nice that a lot of them were usually with the research staff to help them get put together an eight hundred page book that generally people don't read but I don't really need to hear their take on everything going on now because I've written a book about a president from you know Eighteen Seventy I don't really think that that makes them some kind of particular\nVoice of of insider expertise on what's going on today but notice all the criticism there was was actually of the president's tone\n... it's the way that he speaks now I don't even mean the the content of the speech I mean he's the level of his speech and and the sound of his speech now that's a problem she saying Jeb Bush was calming yes Jeb is low energy this long since been established low energy jet\nTrump was giving a rally in Pennsylvania\nAnd you know when he talks about issues relating to to Florida is obviously very concerned his men are cheap there's a big federal response but this is what I mean everything that Trump does Israel I mean when people say things like Trump could cure cancer tomorrow and liberals we're all of a sudden the pro cancer it's true\nIt's not an exaggeration they have involve them their sense of self so much in everything that they're saying and everything that they're they're doing all the time or it has so much to do with with Trump\nThat they just can't help themselves and this is all part of jumped illusion I mean he's the response and we'll get more into their sponsor hurricane probably in the next hour

things there's no evidence there's no there's nothing to say we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the less can control\nNow impeachment is in fact a\nParallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they are gearing up for so whenever we try to have the argument that Trump was not found guilty\nWhen it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial\nTrump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office a which is essentially whatever\nThe house of representatives decides he is guilty of now they can't remove him from office but the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be\nThat President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the\nRacism and massage any insects isn't all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments\nOn policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle of reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's\nYou know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's a massage therapist or not and just oh he's eighty don't vote for him he's ...\nWhich is really what they want to convince everybody about Trump all along but there there's a development in his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work uh I don't want us to my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday\nThat his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify depart defying ... what is that your pie him take away is pie defying a GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition\nThe lawyer Joshua Letty toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his right not satisfying the first and fifth amendments of the constitution\nAh now I understand\nThat this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair the fitness a procedural protection\nAnd there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward who would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do\nSo it's not just that he's taking offense but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump and the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe to become public\nWell when that's the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here\nYou never see a greater revelation of information from this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things it's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambush tearing smeared\nThey're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I just wouldn't know that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller knows that you know to to put more kind of\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out there oh we're going to do some more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election so it won't be till after the election let me get more information but the the Democrats are all in a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise\nAnd and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff and ... the primary\nYou know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment\nLane here than anything else you know they're trying to say that Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a potent puppet but I Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues of the hill who have been breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more coming up I really do hope and I'm I'm holding out hope\nThat Trump declassify those Pfizer documents on the investigation origin documents that\nThat I think he should do before\nThe election because

will follow you and get up in your face and they want you to sign something and then you know the moment that I Try to step around someone and then they tried to step in front of me again that's not getting aggressive\nNow they're actually threatening my personal space right I mean you know the line between I Want to be verbally aggressive and I'm actually showing aggression where you have to be the fear of your safety is much murkier than a lot of Democrats want to pretend that is right now\nBut you even have the heroes of the world who won't won't call it out won't shouted down they won't say you know what it is we shouldn't do this\nThey'll just say well you know people are angry this is what people are going to do this is what they want to do so you know it it is what it is but that that really\nThat is the attitude that you get from them or ... you know where's the corollary so you don't have the corollary or the um\nThe analogous position on the right when it comes politicians there is no right wing version of antifa there's no right wing version of the Democrats who are saying get up and people's faces and follow them home there is no right wing version of lunatic

up of I don't do a good job they have different is when they wake up to three thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere [laughter] they're getting two thousand dollars that's how a lot of money that people\nI think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump\nAs I've said many times because he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more now that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they want about oh Trump the twenty Fifth Amendment we should get rid of him\nBut they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in that position now forget about they'll say his tone is terrible user races and oh my God you know bring up all this stuff\nThe country and how it functions right now is strong it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there's a feeling of optimism about the nation are certainly optimism about the the economy but they they despise Trump but I I also think\nThat when we start to evaluate why is that we've had some of these ... there was a couple of phenomena these are related and and I'm just really thinking out loud on this one but it's something that's been on my mind for a while team so I'll share with you you have these these never Trump or types\nWho have some of them have gone right up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well which teams are that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are\nA but why is it that they um they hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from ... not exclusively government backgrounds\nI I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and they're of the system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one\nHe isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management\nOf that other people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the distillation of this boy you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the the Gergen effect\nOr work for for June presidents or Roger ... advisory wars were ... you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip through it offers and you know you get these guys\nTo the whole their whole resume is this long stretch of government work and and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better then somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector in the real world\nAnd hasn't made this cross over into public service\nAnd I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of this I Am when really aware of it now that I'm In the swamp in\nDC they really don't like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out I
