lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nAll about how he's going to be Ted Cruz when now that just laughable but there's another race that maybe deserves a second look here at least for what it tells us about the Democratic party if not what it tells us about the\nPossibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board\nSmiling at corruption Democrats tried to save Bob and then does months after his bipartisan as admonished meant\nA Kim great to have you back\nAnd it's great to be here are out what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] yeah well as you said you know what's notable here is that ... the entire media has felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look at how Ted Cruz is is that not like pulling away from it all worked as a racist even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where the Democrat Bob Menendez\nWet you mentioned um he was censored by his colleagues rather modest by his colleagues back earlier this year I'm after she had been\nFound to have accepted also get from a man who is now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on the government an all time I'm not only was he accepting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules\nBut he was working on behalf of this guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including gone so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry that department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat changed the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he wasn't honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob Cuban Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it's it's really driving a favor\nHow'd you say there is a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I hear this people will be the all the time and I say okay well what is it and then there's this has nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who\nWhether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and they were to open a Bush has gone on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi this summer actually handed out to her members a toolkit a talking point about how they supposedly go after Republican corruption Trump and and all sorts of other\nIssues none of which as you said there is any real evidence for but in the meantime they just close their eyes of the in some cases actually or outright helping I mean look the Democrat that's why it's called the calls smiley corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majority superPAC helping Senate Democrats decided to re route three million dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race on money that they're taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to defend seats on and places like Trump won\nUm because he's in so much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption have get their adult trail of evidence that very clear in fact the senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can return him to office\nAnd I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving and one of them is on this uh as as on the notion of corruption which as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but do you have so many Democrats you start to think about all the Democrats have gone to prison than the last oh four or five years for\nIncredibly obvious a very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in in any of this discussion as I said there's always this big old Trump most you know someone starts telling me about the ... that tends to be what I hear about a\nBut also on on the notion of mobs I I have to say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land\nBut most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy looking absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have\nCivil society we have to pay it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing when an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nParents absolutely nothing written in any of that formal or informal rolls of our society that give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm this is the fact precisely why we have a ballot box in elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there anyway and well eight not ma and be they're just saying what they think\nWe all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper or you go to vote\nOr that you know harassing people on the street is not and that's the best it got then conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy Maris\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make a production I mean who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic UC right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which you won't hearing on the mainstream media\nIs how different this is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying with complete definite proof that the Democrats blown it to a certain extent they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down five seats one way or the other right\nOn whoever does win and going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nGive us Ross everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns and also her book the intimidation\nIm him always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon\nAnd\nYeah I I think he was a lot on there with the it's gonna be five she is going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all the show election I obviously a but we're not going to know who control the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch will I get the polls closed around age there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till I don't know maybe the next morning it's gonna it's gonna be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue ripple a little bit [noise]\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chasing people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies and\nAnybody that shows up at a Trump rally in words demographer had you've got all kinds of nonsense going on about the post Kavanaugh rage from all the different progressive how about we all just stop that crap and drink some delicious coffee how about that for an idea\nBecause that's where I Do every day I drink whack rifle coffee every morning I drink at all on black because it is delicious high quality small batch roast or coffee I've made\nConverts all of my office I'm like why are you drinking at ... when you could be drinking black rifle a company\nFounded by veterans and it's all about delicious coffee go check it out for yourself [noise] nothing cares about attitudes quite like starting your day with the most American coffee ever black rival coffee visit black rival coffee dot com slash ... Fifteen Percent off your order that black rifle coffee\nDot com slash book for Fifteen Percent off like level coffee dot com slash bar [noise]\n\nSelfless service super guiding principle but drives Army National guard soldiers to be always ready whenever\nDisastrous dry your your next door neighbors and your colleagues in offices\nUh we can give a diplomatic statement about it we can say this was terrible you should never have done this\nBut we're not going to prosecute anyone we don't have any mechanism even for prosecuting anyone a this was a crime committed on Turkish soil so we don't have any jurisdiction here to speak up it was also donate a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil\nSo this is a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent resident a lot of people focus in on that but\nDo you still not a citizen or he held foreign citizenship show we don't why is this the president situation primarily to handle you know why is this something where the president of the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action\nAnd we do we know the answer the answer is that is because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and all this other stuff or any loves dictators here's Obama's former\nPublic relations propaganda czar from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be political fought\nWhat we're seeing her Christmas is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist that we call them the money is enemy of the states and we're giving a green light not just the Saudi regime\nBut ... any regime around the world who wants to harm dissidents harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world is no longer on their side\nI think it has with Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that is sort of Romanoff folly of family\nAnd their families seem to be locked together Jared yes it is and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... ... ... oh my gosh I don't know why anyone I don't want anyone listens to that guy just showed desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management MSNBC I don't know why people listen to what I really don't know among one of the worst analysts on TV\nOr a total of leave it used to be a conservative and say whatever you have to say to try to be relevant at any point in time but you you have there are two different versions of giant bull crap\nA bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the ... the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people\nAre I I hate to break it to you but you know there are journalists there are propaganda apparatus sigh in countries where journalists are the enemy of the people straight up\nIs the north Korean ministry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes is North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people whether the ... yes same thing is true in Iran than destroying a lot of countries\nJust being a journalist did not give you some moral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the swamp dwelling journalists around me here in Washington DC they they really think that there's a national and they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is as you always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know\nThat that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them work with the sleeves again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and ... where we could create a cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get you ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis any meaningful way\nFor running one of the crappy as countries on earth despite all of its oil wells no administrator no president including Obama who's battling literally bowing to the south it's okay to everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do I don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure what he's a columnist\nThe guy was in a is an opinion writer for no I'm not saying that means that you know anything as happened to him but the way they're talking about him is like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes an opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked me to an American conservative Web and attacked somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less outrage about this\nJust the fact it is\nJust that if if it were someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack the Islamic in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis for that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered and but you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up a good she'll be was and this is a fact and\nIslamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood is like your trampling on the man's great\nThat's that's just telling the truth\nHe wasn't Islamist nobody he wouldn't deny this view were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered\nOh I I almost left out that he also uh that they dress the somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of him leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left in that they had no knowledge and they were going to disappear and\nThat was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nLet me give you a little bit of in jail agency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operate that this was a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is ripe regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasions most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nUm and\nThey get very adapted dealing with that threat\nBut they also often operate in places where they can be really\nHam fisted\nI guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can\nBe clumsy and sloppy and get away with it and that's what I think happened here the Saudis\nThe Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be sluggish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug issue in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be self sufficient turkey\nAnd that may have been miscalculation here they thought that they could get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there's also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus that is at work\nSo a lot of intrigue here we'll be right back\nThere's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that social media platforms are not a public utility they're not they're just for the free exchange of ideas they are Internet companies but they're also media outlet they are platforms and they make editorial decisions all the time and guess what\nThe big ones out there are making editorial decisions that favor Democrats progressive and the left and they're doing it on a regular basis you know this you heard about the shadow ban and you've heard about the deep platform ing\nObvious strategies that I've seen him in a in a modern campaign we just literally show off everywhere all the time for every one you can be without interruption in from the battle back much I Love your thinking well you\nKnow there's so many [laughter]\nYou know rock star amazing NATO that's a reporter got the Mike and and the whole thing you know star really that's what\nYou say the the the guy that\nThis is your interview subject now like I Know people were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter\n... from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left or or even in the ... the quote mainstream media is down in the middle journalists the big lie but they still couldn't do it have they ever gone to somewhere with Trump like wow you're you're a political phenomenon the likes of which this country has probably never seen\n'em does anyone ever say that they they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do it was a rock star Trump is a some kind of super human superstar right but they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that\nYou know they they buy into this mythology runs got ... ... says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic I I don't see it at all\nI don't I don't know what I mean I like the guy was okay looking and you know sounds okay and as the old saying things strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess there's a and a myth a kind of mixing\nHere in their minds of that running a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and who charisma thing that Obama had\nSo it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama politically speaking pulled together\nUm and I think that is how they view which uh I think that's kinda the way that cause they're obsessed with this guy\nAnd I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying and I think it's true\nThey know he's going to lose going to lose by double digits up until he lose by by nine or ten points\nThat's what they think that a lot of good enough showing in Texas the case will be they'll win all the blue states and be competitive in the red\nStates and he can take on Trump\nAnd I'm here to tell you that Trump would crush him so bad\nNews radio I'm Brian shook the president isn't calling Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz lying Ted anymore President Trump is in Houston tonight rallying

to wake her up from her dream because that there was a violation of could send that goes on there now I pointed out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's a consent issue because they were talking about it which who has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a prince to kiss her she saved her life like kissing her\nShow it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we're talking about this\nBecause if somebody is choking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that your choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking as the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some out to mouth resuscitation you

was another one I forget who another actress came at all I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories\nThat is instill very basic one creative sensibility and young people but also have some basic morality entailed so good and evil and now they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I\nPromise you I don't know a single guy who in college
