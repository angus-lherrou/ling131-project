Jeff Zucker released this official statement from CNN the president of CNN released this ... ... ... you know President Trump had already said what are the audio that I played for you of\nYou know there's no place for for political violence in American society none or threats no that's the president says\nHere's how the president of CNN responds\nQuote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter though so far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis isn't just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is this is it's the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's\nWords that are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing without even knowing who this is what the real motivation is\nThis is the this is a disgrace and\nThere's no shortage of this rhetoric coming from people now they they view this as a means\nOf getting even with Trump now you know and they also view this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the left is a bunch of screaming mob ing maniacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both sides now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus and all of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them are going to claim victims status over this\nAll the way up until election day before we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done\nAnd you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember I Do not remember the head of Fox News or the head of you know it and forget about the head of it and they do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in\nRush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I I Do not remember any of them saying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that a Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic\nActually shot Steve ... and he almost died and tried to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress\nBecause of their insane rhetoric because of their\nThey've been calling the president of the United states oh trader or Russian huge a crazy person a rapist or racist white nationalist effectively a clan member\nAnd they said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions someone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point where finally there's a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are under threat and I I Am the ... I you know I Am consistent on this you do not hurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas you don't do it\nNobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting\nIt's illegal it's immoral and it's if you really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America right now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side but I'd have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and an evil in stupid on every level\nBut if the Democrats who have been trying to blur the lines for the last six months or so and it's the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president\nAnd as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as a mainstream left wing writers will have been saying if you really believe that friends the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear war if you believe those things\nThen taking extreme measures does not seem like such a leap does it\nThey have not been pushing back on Trump for tax reasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with any of the same\nVigor and seriousness and ferocity as they have on all these fantasy that they have conjured around Russia collusion and twenty Fifth Amendment of Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now\nAnd now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this happened and this is right from the very top this is right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened Jeff Zucker\nNow I can sit here and say without any feelings of of ah she position is\nThat my criticisms of CNN all stent\nCNN is a dishonest news organization that is pushing an agenda that is furthering division in this country that lives about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like Acosta an others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taken all kinds of shots at the Republicans and the president maybe they're actually go to criticize you back with words with words there are allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I Can't also sit here and say I I'm happy to hear that no one is CNN was hurt\nThat I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't I Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work on skates and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something unseemly and unethical about immediately trying to make it or will you can still criticize us and hope that we're okay you can't condemn these\nBombs being sent to us but also continue to criticize us no I I I can and will and it's not just seeing that it's all these other ... you know it's it's George Soros is doing the funds incredibly destructive\nIncredibly destructive programs for freedom in for liberty and at America I mean he he is behind a lot of very bad stuff\nUm and then when you add it you know then you add into this also obviously the the Obamas in the Clinton the people who are ideological opponents\nDoesn't mean that I hate them I don't\nRespect the Clintons but I mean I you know I disagree strenuously with the Obamas I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I'm allowed to not respect and that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their beliefs for that matter\nBut not not even a day passes not even a day passes\nFor us to deal with this issue to figure out who's behind this to figure out what's going on or without it\nUse right away in the most obvious bashing disc or political points but I was going to say the Democrats think this is the way they can actually ensure they win the house and maybe stopping a red wave in the Senate that's what they think this is that's what they're using is that\nYeah the rice and attacked the media barely even better than I Do need or someone sending rice into like Madison the White House or the Pentagon\nNo that was a story for about an hour don't pay any attention to that so\nWe ... what what are they really saying you're out of the whole ... thing there what do you know I must say we're not blaming anybody interest all the right wing people criticized these people and that's the only thing we know about them so excluded the right wing sprawl that's that's what you're really to take away from that playing this game of ... we're not jumping to conclusions but he was a conclusion\nThat's what the left is up to hear a this is inherently a very political issue and I I Know\nThat this is a serious issue and nobody should be you know should be it with bottles and no one has been injured yet either so let's also let's let let's not let's not back resolves into we can't even talk about this on my gosh you know the ... there's a you know the bodies haven't even been very you know once you've been harmed yet\nSo we should feel free to talk about this issue without feeling like we're being disrespectful to the families of the you know we want everyone to be safe we want everyone to be okay but this is in the heat of a political campaign to so yeah this is an issue we are going to talk about\nThis left is already trying to shape this whole thing though to their advantage is just so\nThey don't want anyone else to do any of that so no one else can be political\nDemocrats [noise]\nBecause they are victims of of course\nThe news radio I'm Brian shook us suspicious item address the California congresswoman Maxine Waters is being investigated in LA

they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and people are going to act out and there is no human being more responsible for the climate weren't than Donald Trump\nThe president and his allies the need to dial down the political rhetoric and they are making people let's say they are making journalist ... they and they are making law enforcement officer is

[noise]\nAnd those responsible will be brought to justice [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nThat's what the vice president says does that change any of the ... or any of the junior here on from the media and there's no\nI actually saw someone said today or I forget that the journals another blue check you know Twitter journal person\nOr say that the Trump statement where he said there's no place for political violence in this country or threats in this country that that was the bare minimum that he said the bare minimum I'm like well does he have to give us an hour long speech Amish or what what they're going to criticize a matter of what he does\nWhether it's could show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him\nYou know earlier today actually there were just talking about the president's it's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible noticed you know my objection to Obama that I thought he had bad ideas he wasn't nearly as related to the media pretend that he was and he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level\nActually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I'm going to bomb us or you know that's that seems admirable\nBut I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed and I think all that that that's come Obama wasn't some maniac\nBut that's how they feel about Trump and now because some maniac\nSomewhere we don't even know why yet but somebody somewhere sent these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzle me here's what they were saying about him earlier in the day it's liquid for\nHow sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election he gets caught the lie he changes his story again and says we're\nGoing to get sort of actually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid clear officially and parents and in fact France how\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he's putting all out there in spreading a lot of lines about non white people to fall white crowd to make a sound a lot of what the president saying it's just\nNot true that seems to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and health oxygen ...\n\nThis is a an an article of faith now do you have to say this all the time\nWhen ever asked them what what's the lie what they're really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your health care plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done with forethought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans\nNegative impact what what is the law that lines up with that but that is crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius you know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I can recognize as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do\nKnow he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to the worst possible scenario\nThey never get tired of it either oh my gosh\nYou know in the left in the media they they find endless ways\nTo reach a Lebanon the outrage meter ten is not enough eleven the outrage me in regards his brother I Know I I just get frustrated with that too it's it's so tiresome\nAnd they're all their calls for civility or they're being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these a prominent leftists their calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again they like the old order\nWe sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice and we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that\nThat's what they want us to go back to crumble and play that game they're not saying let's all be good to each other day defend the mobs in the restaurants we'll talk more about that later they defend these tactics then it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control every one they're favorable to this stuff\nAnd now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down\nAfter Eighteen months of propaganda I think to their base the president's at trader a sexist a rapist or a you know a racist a everything crazy going to start a war is a fascist they stopped they said about President Trump but it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life\nIt is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close\nNow they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously these people are these people are really in need of reality check 'em\nReally and he got Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met him don't really care to a\nBut this was a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... what it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to because you with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not him in Mika\nA\nNow because Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage rants\nAnd first doing today is on Christ like I mean this is oh here's what's ... six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame that we ever had a president like this one\nA vet turned his back on the most basic not only the most basic American concepts of what we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting a here legally\nWhat Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read in some Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and a\nSide in the Bible to criticized Trump I mean this guy has no shape no shame\nWhatsoever I mean he goes over at MSNBC and\n... that show up for sale in the morning I hear so much blather and so much nonsense and as long as anti Trump you know the audiences\nYou it's good to like the the works really really is an embarrassment but you know people people believe what they want to believe unfortunately this world my friends and you know I'm here in the swamp of what you find out more\nAnd more is that so many of these folks that that thinks that they're standing proud for the truth in the media they're really just it's all about their own their own brand their own paycheck in their own access all the time\nThey don't know what they do if they were doing this job and they just want to get his co you to power responsible and they're not in the Trump orbit they want to be as far away from it as they can so they can be in the anti Trump orbit\nAnd there's very few people that you can try to strike any kind of neutral balance anymore I mean this is just this is a media war\nThat's the plan I I'd rather not I'd rather not allow that to uh to happen not not on my watch if I could afford it away or\nRussia collusion fall out of the headlines tomorrow but I have George Papadopoulos on rising with me so if you want to see that very interesting interview uh but I wanted to do something because you know this guy's got some prison time\nAnd for what a has a felony on his record now and the whole thing is such a joke around him but here's a congressman ice it talking about this play eight\nWe're going into an election in which real wrong doing two years ago\nIs still not properly investigated well a special investigator Mohler is continuing to indict people for unrelated crime as an active though there's collusion when he hasn't had one piece of it then he's been able to demonstrate\nSo the the voters are going in with some very interesting misinformation or lack of information and two years is a long time it's too long and we should have deposed him today yup\nI completely agree with ice in one part of this whole election that we don't talk about enough\nIs how it is tainted by there's a deep state action against the president not just the effort to create this false Russia collusion narrative but also the Mueller probe which Grimes along and with these trumped up oh conspiracy against the United states charges that stuff is crazy\nIt's nonsense and\nThat affects voting that affects people's minds about this president and really profound ways so you know the the left is already stacked the deck there already cheating\nInnocence already playing dirty and\nWho knows how much dirtier I told you you guys members I started a couple of weeks ago I think we've got another October surprise you know I said it on this show we got something else it's going to hit us and I can't tell you exactly what's going on today but I can tell you that\nWell

Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance disposal\nJohnny Was was wounded in combat and his role as an EEO detect and that he knows everything about these devices how they're built how you tracked them and what they can do a job at great to have you on that thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAll right so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can we say about\nThese devices bunch pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there of what's notable to you about these bombs\nWell you know I can only go off really the the information ... giving and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going to what we see what we hear um it so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nAnd it had some sort of timing device on the outside of it was doing it for both\nAnd the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bonded either once that time or hit a certain time and a pre determined time in its past life it would\nTurn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do you take that same signal that same electrical signals you re route that into a circuit that detonate the bombs so that\nOne normally the light would come on the bond that ... normally the bell wondering when an alarm clock the bond that nature of the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so if a switches of breaking a circuit than an arming a and arming mechanism is another breaking the circuits so circuits still open\nBut once the arming gets closed and the next thing that closes the switch full set it off so we know and and the use of timing devices\nThey're used for one or two things either to predict turban when the bomb goes off or to keep yourself as the bomb maker time to get away from it before it's armed and so if this bond is a functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture\nBut if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way then we would call this a time device or out of their time to arm or trying to debt day\nAnd being that it was in a field package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation than we kind of have to believe from what we can see from that picture that it's a time to detonate device meaning they said\nYou know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it was their radically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey you I mean this is going to be a very\nUm [noise] I don't know how sloppy way to try to target an individual right any assuming this was actually sent through the mail to just have a timing device on it and you have to be guessing\nWhen it would be you know it sounds like it's more likely could blow up still a risk to people could really could kill somebody who could blow up in the mail processing center and the mailman hand perhaps or eight on any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it it it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much information and hauling to divulge than in detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening and there are certain things that you know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail\nAbout how boundary made about Ninety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart and the information is on the Internet there's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured\nAnd uh and so what we have right now is if this is a fleet of vi speeches meaning that it\nCould function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or or take apart what is there to recover some of those pieces then perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces they can\nMore easily point it's in the right direction when I Would say or were you really I'm just like an Austin or the shipping of the package if you know the one that we're looking at now seems to be the hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage him was that actually put through a a delivery service or\nThat someone just hand is talking to someone outside and say hey I'll give you twenty dollars a ticket and that's the only thing we don't know and those those leads those human lead\nThe tracking the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over at Quantico with the FBI will utilize some tools and techniques we have this safely disassembled this bomb\nAnd uh and if there are specific components that are serialized or manufactured at a very low rate from one manufacturer then that's going to give us a lot of information right there and\nCinder down there you've done a demonstration project it works put it to use ...
