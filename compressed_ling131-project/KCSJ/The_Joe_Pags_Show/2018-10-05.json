week ago I was in Washington DC covering the hearing that\nThat took the last bits\nOf testimony from Kavanaugh\nAnd a doctor for it I ran into but a day and it was raining crazy in Washington DC and that's kind of where we set up this week in felons yadda yadda yadda\nBut as I was there I stood inside the Senate office building and covered some of the protests and I asked or tried to ask Elizabeth Warren when she was going to take a DNA test\nAnd she turned and ran away wouldn't answer it got mad at me a than a Jeff Merkley of Oregon another Democrat was there and I asked him\nIf he didn't think Joe Biden statement on FBI reports about sexual abuse in sexual harassment because he said they they were not worth anything if that didn't hurt his argument and he\nDenied knowing about it which is a lie and then he turned and ran away\nAnd I wish I were in D.C today I'm not I'm In the constitutionally protected free speech bunker in the woods of Delaware and I'm watching the reports of the busloads and busloads of people who are headed\nTo DC and I watched some of the marches around the Capitol today with women holding a pre printed signs and women wearing the shirts that say be a hero and the signs that say cabin nope\nAnd all the stuff that has been printed by George Soros funded groups are printed by planned\nParenthood by the way can we talk about Planned Parenthood opposing judge Kavanaugh\nDon't they get a billion dollars or more in taxpayer funding\nI think they do I think it might even be more than that Planned Parenthood gets a lot of our money gets money from me gets money from you\nAnd when I was at the protest last week a week ago Planned Parenthood it's set up camp\nOn the benches in the quad drained go inside the U.S Senate office building and they were working the room handing out free T shirts to anybody who wanted them free T shirts and they have pre printed signs\nThey also had stationary\nAnd directions on how you could write a letter to your a senator or congressman to tell them that they needed to be vocal about Kevin Oh and this is all\nYour tax dollars at work I thought I thought Planned Parenthood was all about women's health\nAnd I thought so giving away free T shirts to oppose a nominee to the Supreme Court that's that's really what's your all about\nIt seems like we need to pull that funding back\nAnd I know some of you are going to say look Planned Parenthood does things really good things well Planned Parenthood does not do mammogram so anyone tells you as Planned Parenthood did today\nThat uh mammograms are all about breast health they might be but Planned Parenthood doesn't give mammograms they don't provide that\nSo there's a little bit of ... there as well we we have much to get into day well like I said we've got to talk about China getting inside our phones and spying on us it it's not just um it's not just a Dianne Feinstein\nWho had a Chinese spy apparently all of us who have a cell phone or

wouldn't doubt it if there's going to be a few Democrats that\nThat the Democrat leadership to just say go ahead and vote for him that way you'll look good and plenty of people um I I ... I really feel for professor Ford\nAs a you know and and and that kept me off because they were mistreated by the Democrats if you look at her testimony especially you know about the the question about what she was asked\nThat you know\nWe have come come to you in California to be interviewed she basically was like I didn't know this nobody told me this lawyers\nAfter Democrats paid for\nIt not informed of this option they want it because they wanted her to come to DC and they even tried to tell her to say oh tell her that's attorney client privilege as she was like\nNo I I I would've I would've entertain them coming to me in and answer their questions in California I think that she really did not want things to go public that she just had some recollection that she wanted to keep quiet and then the Democrats\nSaid this is something we can use to a\nStore and she she will be I feel very badly for her obviously if you listen to her testimony something happened to Christine for\nSomething happened to her at a party but she can't she can't put Brett Kavanaugh there none of the people she said were there could put in there\nThe story changed the dates changed the story about having to doorways at her house\nReally doesn't hold up because one of those entrances was made for an office at the house so it wasn't about being panicked the story about being afraid to fly doesn't hold up because she flew all around the world in big planes in small planes\nI Know that that if you're afraid of flying because my wife is terrified of flying\nAnd if it's for work or pleasure it doesn't matter\nShe thinks if you're in that plane something bad is going to happen so a ... if she truly had a fear of flying it wouldn't just affected in business relations were affected in every aspect of her life so there's just too much there\nTo hang this on Kavanaugh now did something happened to her yeah probably she was in a school where there's a lot of drinking and by the way\nWe'll get into the devil's triangle tonight because they yearbooks are really going to weigh into my conversations this evening I've done a little bit of snooping Jeremy Jeremy or can I ask when you graduated high school\nI graduated in Ninety seven and here's here's a here's here's another thing that I'd like to throw out there to okay you're listening to this\nThis is something I'm not a victim of sexual assault but my wife was when she was younger literally Thirty years ago when she was you know you know early early early single digits\nAnd it was by a\nUm a cousin who was not very mature it himself\nHe he later she did not get the therapy did not\nBecca weight and Roy Moore has happened down here most of the march and this policy what people don't understand is they both ...

monitoring all the Kavanaugh stuff but uh if you drifted over to see\nSpan as ... like me will do you may have caught this moment\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or coercing American businesses movie studios universities think tank scholars journalists and local state and federal officials\nAnd more civil China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nVice president Mike Pence delivering a very serious address about China and what China is trying to do also going on in the background discussions with North Korea over what the next meetings going to be with\nDonald Trump and Kim Jong Owen and this part of the world is kind of important and meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbook and ... and moving and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think is just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it at Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us today\nHow are you I'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population\nAre resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense or not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them but I think China is starting to get to be\nA a little bolder why why suddenly now are they coming within forty five yards of our\nNaval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents are we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidence\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters the the Chinese have been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder\nThe one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China and that's a good thing and so the restrictions working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that\nIn vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to other people you can find it it's on line and you can do something ... going to C SPAN and watch it which I recommend 'cause I think\nVice president Pence has the potential\nTo be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations uh Mike Pence appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions\nAnd I I think he is a real secret weapon for this administration\nAnd that speech to me was welcomed now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now as fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into the uh the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the United states and\nThat springs so much joy into our lives they're loyal to protect us and smart yeah the smartest our pets might be they can't advocate for themselves especially in the event of a
