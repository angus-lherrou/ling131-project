that out to us in credible way\nThe first clue that I Want you to listen to is where she describes\nFeeling ism as she understood it and this what she describes as a second wave of feminism\nNeedless to say she has a lot of problems with second wave feminism because it's inherently based on political correctness\nHuman beings need religion they need a ... perspective a cosmic prospect down and getting rid of the office max religions because there was too conservative and simply led to the new religion of political correctness I\nMean I'm only eleven second singer she's absolutely right the dinner gracious of religion as a whole I don't care whether it's Judaism hinder was a lot of Christianity or I don't care what it is but the deliberation of religion\nBy the Marxist list\nHas been

that we have on earth when you consider how wall\nThe earth has been in existence then you tend to want you tend to be arrogant is just like with climate change why do I think climate change advocates are so arrogant because they think\nThey substitute of religion they've taken God out of the equation and they think that somehow a public policy mandating fewer fossil fuels or more wind turbines or this or that\nIs somehow going to change what Mother Nature does its other arrogance she continues\nAnd I and and the it's the same kind of fanaticism I mean I I mean I I have found that the second wave feminists\nAnd I I don't know if the Spanish Inquisition I'm not kidding I can ... you know like any anything with that that's I mean any any form of dissent even within feminism is treated as heresy okay and and they and they actually tried to destroy you went when I when I\nWow didn't we just see that\nAny sort of dissention even within the feminist right what do they do the left eats their own and that's what she's pointing out\nThere is no room for this so there is no room for critical thinking that's what that's why when I called the well the current wave of Democrats fascist and mark says this is why\nThere was no critical thinking it's just well that is just about feeling roads I'm\nMy mind at my might be Sunday at random onion anyone there was clearly an organized
