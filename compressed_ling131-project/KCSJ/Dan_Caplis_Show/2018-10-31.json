Fox News President Trump in Florida for the first I'll be eleven rallies in eight states boxes that Iran has more live it hurts arena outside Fort Myers\nAnd the thirteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment which does a whole bunch of important stuff including that and of course the fifteenth amendment which says that the right to vote cannot be a bridge based on race so\nI'm I'm trying to understand what it is that they were trying to achieve back in what was Nineteen Eighteen sixty eight with this amendment ... it was it so that anybody who immigrated here and had a baby would become a United States citizen\nKnow the primary thing they were trying to achieve with this particular clause along amendment issue as you know John were just talking about the first sentence of it which is called the citizenship clause its purpose was to ensure that African Americans\nWho were born here even if they had been slaves were uh were treated us citizens as you know of the United states and\nJust for refreshing my my history even those slavery was legal until the thirteenth amendment importing slaves was against the law correct at a certain point\nThat's correct and that raises a whole host of very interesting issues because anybody who is important between Eighteen away when the slave trade was made illegal and Eighteen fifty six when slavery was abolished\nThat person was an illegal alien and um you would think at\nColorado not of not of his own shoes and all of his own but he\nBut he's in the country illegally and so you would think that Congress would have taken that into consideration but\nHere where there are a lot of I'm Sorry with a lot of slaves who were smuggled into the United states after the ban on importation of slavery well did you\nFind a lot I I don't know that anybody really knows me knows no certainly that their worst touch person and that they're not and that their presence was known about but the people who drafted the fourteenth amendment you know they they weren't like the founders of the U.S\nUp the founders the people who wrote the original constitution were extremely precise\nAbout the language they use their extremely competent draft a lot of people who tell you out there that language and the original constitution is vague it generally is not about the fourteenth amendment was not as well drafted\nAnd so I'm not even sure that the people who drafted it really knew what the phrase\nSubject to the jurisdiction meant in completely they they did understand that if someone was let's say born an Indian tribe out in Montana Territory before it was a stay at that person would not be a citizen I understood that\nAre they understood that someone who was born in this country was African American even if he or she had been a slave would be a citizen\nBut I don't think that they fully thought through all the implications of what subject to the jurisdiction there of means and for the Supreme Court has had to struggle with that phrase on two occasions\nAnd only two occasions as this is a law that's been around for what a hundred and fifty years or an amendment and it's only been looked at it from the Supreme Court twice\nExtraordinary isn't it a but there's a lot of\nThere are a lot of permission of the constitution like that\nBoth of the cases that interpreted that language subject to the jurisdiction there off off of um arose in the latter part of the nineteenth century one held that I'm a Indians who were parts that were members of tribes\nAre out in the territories that they were not citizens you know they they were later granted citizenship by statute but they were not subject to the to the jurisdiction of\nThe United states for first up there 'cause that's that's fascinating yeah fourteen amendment and the fourteenth amendment that that just wanna make sure I'm I'm up this we will so when the fourteenth amendment passed\nIt did not apply to Native American Indians and that later on by an act of Congress they\nWere made into citizens but even even those people who were born in American territory because they were on a reservation where they they were an Indian uh territory they weren't citizens of the United states\nThat's right the tribal tribal members okay I mean if somebody was it in their involuntarily left the tribe and came to you know be an American citizen that that was different\nBut I Try tribal Indians were not citizens the second case dealt with the question of the children of illegal immigrants\nOr what happened here was that there was a Chinese couple living in California in San Francisco they were here in this country illegally and they had a son and then the son left the country to go visit China came back and the immigration authorities wouldn't let him out and they said you know you're not a citizen\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court said he absolutely a\nCitizen or that because he was born by legal that's right and what it was that ruling they\nSet those uh that that's a Eighteen eighty four and so that I'm a that decision held that people who are in this country illegally ours are in what the what the\nRob you're gonna have to hold that thought

Congress could similarly interpret all the phrase as yet a team's best but the ultimate decision has got to be up to the courts\nOkay so I haven't heard\nPaul Ryan say this would be a question for Congress\nCould he doesn't he doesn't really know either does he\nKnow he doesn't it could be a question for Congress and and if Congress reaches an interpretation one way or another it's possible the

you'll forgive me call three ... three seven one three eight to five five seven one three talk\nSo surprise surprise when the experts on television tell you the president does not have the authority to do this with complete certainty does not have the authority to\nDo to make sure that\nPeople who come here and have a baby who are here illegally that baby can't be a citizen of the answers we don't know the courts haven't looked at it since the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd that whole little of jurisdiction phrase has a lot lot to do with it so the beating force if they have a baby year according to the Supreme Court ruling back then those people were not citizens\nI'm not convinced this is a slam dunk he can't do it the way that the New York times and NPR will tell you it's going to the phones three ... three seven more than three eight to five five to Denver we go Mike you with with me John killed era\nSo like I I Would love to see a lot more background\nThat the example that Nader sing gave about uh the rescue boats\nTaking a pregnant woman on a like to know more history about when that sort of thing came up\nAs it always I mean I don't know that we can gauge in rescue operations that long and ... as it was it sort of default because the anchor baby concept was already kind of ingrained and so they just people that did that or is there some actual legal reason for it the latter\nOr get it at the southern ... it's not there for a second I think the point of what Rob Nielsen just taught us is that\nWhole legal principle\nHasn't been challenged to the courts for for a resolution since the late Eighteen hundreds so anything that the president does\nCould start the ball rolling on what that really means so even by him making such a pronouncement via executives I'm\nAn executive order it could result in clarity on what the Fourth Amendment means as far as citizenship so I don't I I kinda hope he does it\nAnd and then just to be clear as far as the less concerned there is nothing this president can do that he has the authority to do\nYet in resident before he put in more executive orders and the other ... yesterday I think yeah it was fine\nOr aid even be in there right now yeah so uh but the last word in that sort of settings paragraph wherein they reside that reside word also strikes me you know if you're here on vacation you don't reside here\nThat's why the the reasoning for it applying to slaves of course they reside here this was their their home at least you know it had been for quite a number of years they didn't just happen to be walking through on a on a vacation\nAnd that reside anyway I just\nThink that well I had my I I think the resigned regular I I think that refers\nTo pardon my my English at the nuns taught me but I Believe that means of the state so in other words it says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and the here's the fund raise and subject through the jurisdiction there of meeting the jurisdiction of the United states\nAre citizens so this is the other part of the sentence they are citizens of the United states and of the state where they reside which means that if you reside in Colorado your Colorado citizen if you write and I didn't\nKnow what if you're just you're on vacation and you have a baby you don't reside here you just happen to be standing on\nThat right by the phrase or moment I I miss the time when when I was a kid the nuns would have us um graph out sentences you have to do a graph you have to do this you do these lines and so\nThe where of has to do with being a state\nBut that that doesn't come into play unless you are a citizen subject to the jurisdiction there up so if you're not a subject of of jurisdiction therefore you're not as a citizen in the United states then that last phrase and of the state where in the reside wouldn't apply to that person\nGraph right up to ... and it becomes you know\nThey could have just as easily left out that whole section of and subject to the jurisdiction there they they wouldn't have put it in there if it meant\nAnybody who has a baby on the soil it's completely redundant to put it in there if that was the meaning\nIt must remember when this was ratified when this was ratified at Eighteen sixty eight it's not like you could jet on over here to drop your baby off of it to get here was in or\nDeal or unless you live right on the ... or do I do like cat Canadian or order you know neighbors right but even then to make that try to make the trip back then was not was not an easy thing so\nIt had more to do is slavery that it had to ride with within ... knows\nAnd those people live here anyway I just I think it's a to think that the anchor baby concept applies I think flies in the faith that negates any other immigration law you can have it just makes\nNo one's taking or taking my call let's see if we can squeeze out an anti really fast and then we got less than a minute you're with John
