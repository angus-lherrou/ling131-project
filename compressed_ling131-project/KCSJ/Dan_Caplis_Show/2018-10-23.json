opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying or laws that we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America\nIs to respect the laws of this land and respect America sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be

world America had the money you know we do so much already\nTook to the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars we've spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can't take care of themselves they will be taking care of\nNo Americans never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood was the cause of liberty and freedom for many people

there would be some type of confrontation 'cause he couldn't take it could happen it would be good for people on both sides\nIt'll encourage people to follow our laws and respect our country and our borders and our sovereignty and at that point people go through the process legally and I'm not saying that we don't let people in from other countries I don't really care where you come from you know you got to show you were able to take care of yourself\nThat you believe in our values and you want to contribute and you're not a threat to your neighbor that's it it's pretty simple and if you want
