proud to be a part of it\n... one of the things you got to and this is a give back kind of thing but you're looking for some help as this mentoring program really rewarding from what I hear from everybody who's ever done\nYes so I Know a lot of you are out there as gosh there's you're thinking I Want to help while blows you talking about your bag that's right how do we do it or don't just talk about it do it\nAnd we have a way that you can do it and that's due the mentoring program so what we are seeking right now is about Seventy volunteers from the community that are willing to spend one hour a week with a middle school student\nOr in six public middle school schools going so folks can typically pick which school they want to go to underneath the program where he can run ...\nPublic how to me of arts liberty international out in public ... Vineland Andy heroes academy and\nCounselors identify students that need a positive adult role model\nWe need more positive adult role models to step up\nBe willing to have lunch with the student once a week\nAnd you can vary if your schedule is tough maybe go Wednesday one week and if you can't do it then you can you can adjust to Thursday or whatever the day may be but it's one hour a week and it makes a huge difference snake we are seeing in eighty percent of the students that have a mentor their grades improve\nTheir attendance approved and improved and their behavior\nImprove why as well and so it's just somebody that is willing to listen you don't need any special skills you don't need to be a tutor if you forgot algebra long ago don't worry about it now than they do all you need is listening ear and that's exactly what these students need and we do some field trips throughout the year\nBut it's really just having an adult talk about\nTalk to a kid about\nOkay this is what it takes to be in my job and this is why it's so important in your decision and your choices do make a difference in your life and they helped them and guide them to make better choices so we need Seventy and heavy on male\nI was just gonna say if history repeats itself you need guys yes\nSo if you were to take a look at our schools we probably need about sixty percent men to step up\nAnd about forty percent women because typically a lot of kids that are in the program they come from single parent household name perhaps they don't have a father in their life and so it's really important and so again you you you talk all the time you hear it at the water cooler\nAt a bar at a meeting you know what can we do to help publicity and middle school such a tough time this is a way that you can help bridge that gap and make a huge difference in the life of a kid at will last a lifetime one hour week benefits last a lifetime\nSeventh grade was the hardest for years of my life [laughter]\nMe
