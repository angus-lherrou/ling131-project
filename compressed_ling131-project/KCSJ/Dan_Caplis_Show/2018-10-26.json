does but ... to to to ignore the elephant in the room it's just you know it's a fool's folly tie think\nOnce again to shepherd Smith the elephant in the room was Donald Trump\nTo shepherd Smith the elephant in the room is not those who actually say kick them who actually said get in their face to all of the answer for people who actually do get in their face\nTo shift\nBut Smith the elephant in the room as the president of the United states and Chris what was\nHe was handing Shepard Smith is a\nFool's folly I think that it's a really incorrect to somehow hold the president\nEither by
