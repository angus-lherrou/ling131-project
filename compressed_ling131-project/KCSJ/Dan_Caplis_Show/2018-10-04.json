thirty hours could also be conflated down into a shorter time period\nIf senators wave their time to pontificate on the nomination my guess is nobody will\nSo we'll take the full thirty hours and it

yesterday said this morning\nThat data center hardware used by both apple and Amazon Web services and provided by super Mike Rowe was actually under surveillance by the Chinese government now Amazon speech the report\nApple disputes the report which then begs the question and this is the world that we now live\nWho's telling the truth or is the truth somewhere in between with Bloomberg\nJust willy nilly report that the Chinese government was implanting chips into servers used by apple and Amazon\nI don't think so which the beggars the question of is it how extensive as apple is vehemently denying it of course I Would expect apple to do that Amazon is disputing\nThat to me those are two huge differences apple is vehemently denying that that's the case and that there are no Chinese chips on any of its servers or on any ... any of its devices I Can't open my devices up so I don't know I don't know how we tell anyway\nBut Amazon disputes the report\nI'm always fascinated by lawyers language lawyers can be so hypocritical lawyers I I Know because he was one lawyers can be full of crap they can say things that when you read it on Facebook\nOh you you look at it and you go that just doesn't make any sense that's why when\nI hear apple denying the report and Amazon disputing the report\nI tend to more believable than I Do Amazon\nOver the course of the past year apple writes Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with clay and sometimes they sometimes elaborate\nOf an alleged security incident at apple each time we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have absolutely zero evidence to support any of these allegations we have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses on the record refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg story relating to apple\nOn this we can be very clear apple has never found malicious chips hardware manipulations or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any sort of\nApple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident we are not aware of any investigation by the FBI nor or our contacts in law enforcement\n\nWho do you believe you see

Democrat decides to vote yes\nAnd that one Democrat would be Joe Manchin then Joe Manchin could be tagged with this with the rest of his political career that he\nWas the deciding vote that dragged

Senate race I think has probably looked at internal polling that says she's going to lose\nSo North Dakota would be a pick up four Republicans so she's announced that she's going to vote no\nWhy would you do that if you think that Brett Kavanaugh should be on the Supreme Court or if you think the voting yes in red North Dakota that it might get you closer to winning re election\nI think she's looking at it and say no matter what I Do I'm losing I'm so far behind my challenger in North Dakota that it doesn't make any difference so I'm going to vote no so I I think you could write her off unless I mean once again once the roll call starts on Saturday who knows what they do\nKnow I don't think Chuck Schumer Dianne Feinstein will ever focus\nBut I really question mansion does he wants to be the guy does he wants to be the one senator that absent a tie where you bring in the vice president does he want to be the one to bring him all I don't think you'll do that\nHere's what I really do think will help I think Lisa Lisa Murkowski likes me all of these senators like\nThe glare of TV [noise] I think she likes being the lone holdout right now because it keeps everybody told a TV cameras

and trust me it's the same on the other channels to just make fun of Fox because they're my friends\nAnd so I kind of flip up the volume a little bit and I look over and Feinstein and Chuck Schumer coming out of the house or the ... minority leader's office and they walk over to the the likes of cameras\nAnd Feinstein talks first\nIn the first thing she starts doing his ... about\nThe cover up

just for good measure\nYou cannot be tried as an adult\nNow I haven't counted how many people\nAre in California state prison serving life for murder forty fifty probably I don't know\n\nI can think of only three that were committed when they were Fifteen Years old or fourteen years old they were all stone cold killers\nBut the story of one of the fourteen year old was was one of the first monsters you could imagine he and his Fifteen year old co defendant committed multiple shootings in the weeks long crime spree that terrorizes Long Beach about nine or ten years ago\nNow people like that\nWill be held in a juvenile facility into their early twenties at the ... of the outer limit and then they will be released back into society multiple shootings in the weeks long crime spree in

released when they reach twenty Twenty one years old that's reform that's what California's sees as reform\nNow I Know if you've got a Fifteen year old you got a fourteen year old you may be thinking to yourself oh my gosh thank goodness I Hope they do that in Colorado because I Would not want my fourteen or Fifteen year old tried as an adult\nYou know as a parent a grandparent I get that\nBut the realization should be some fourteen and Fifteen year olds commit heinous crime they don't have to be members of MS Thirteen I I was court appointed to prosecute or not to prosecute to defend to fourteen year old\nBoy that raped a little twelve year old girl and the prosecutor even though I thought I believed it was right prosecuted those two as adults\nThat only did they write the little

which\nThey called off because that hearing was being held west but we could go Thursday and clearly Trump didn't want to be interrupted while he was watching the hearings and he certainly didn't want to fire or heavy anything take away from the news of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo Rod Rosenstein lived another week whether he will live another week or not remains to be seen\nNo Baker being the top lawyer

you what they thought he was the subject of FBI investigation leak and he told Fox News obviously he was not going to and could not answer those questions\nSarah Sanders told reporters that the meeting remains limbo between the president Rod Rosenstein\nSlipped back in the news you see it's a never ending circus in Washington DC here's my fear though about the investigation being conducted by the house intelligence committee in the house special of the house select committee on investigation my concern is this\nJust Republicans lose the house next month those investigations will virtually vanish\nBecause if you don't have the support of the house leadership if you can't go to the house will if you can't go to the house majority leader if you can't go to the speaker and say we'd like to issue subpoenas to do this or that\nThe investigation just language\nSo after me this if the house Republicans lose to the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi who apparently it's not going to be challenge or she is going to make any difference if she ends up being speaker\nMaxine Waters who are being house majority leader which is not going to happen but wouldn't it be fantastic\nIf if you look you've republic if you're if Republicans have to lose him closely has to become speaker then I went back seem to be the house majority leader\nThere should be on the news every single day and you know there it it wouldn't take the ten days before she could stick her foot in her ... her foot would be so far down her mouth that we could pulled out a rear end she could scratcher but with her foot\nPole of those investigations will disappear and voted best ... we'll start oh let's see the New York times which is laying the credit for apparently Fred Trump may have violated some tax law\nForty or fifty years ago you wouldn't\nHave both stature limitations has passed on that\nI also find it interesting that then I look I printed out the New York times story about the the whole the whole ... thing I haven't read it yet I Can't get motivated to read and I can't get motivated to read it because we're talking about something that happened decades ago that again is beyond the statute of limitations\nAnd there's a fine line between tax avoidance and tax evasion\nThat the New York times throws around the word tax evasion a lot and Donald Trump says he scored a threat is threatening to sue them I'm not sure there was a public figure he has standing to do that but the state of Fred Trump might have standing\nBecause even though he did you stay to play with the New York
