that the two thousand eight Howard decision decided five to four that struck down stricken gun regulations in the district of Columbia\nAnd also it was the one where Justice Scalia famously wrote to

jurisdictions have applied hell or in different fashions in different circumstances and if there's now this hodgepodge of rulings all over the country\nAnd so they're trying to get the Supreme Court to revisit Heller and actually defined whether based on you know in what I Love about it is they have picked the most the religious\nLaw which is New York city\nWhich claims that oh we're in
