Mother Jones says could hurt Heidi Heitkamp free election\n\nTime out for just one moment\n\nHow many of these Indians do you think have driver's license yeah probably all up how many of those driver's licenses probably have some sort of street address all\nThe other thing that the voter can do now let's be realistic here not talking about Elizabeth Warren\nBut if you're in the Indian living on a reservation and you don't have a street address yet you have a post office box you have utilities you have managed to make it to a post office to rent a post office box\nAnd every week or every month for every day you're able to make it to the post office box to insert your key\nTurn a clockwise pull your mail out close the door turn it back counterclockwise pull the key out get back in your car and drive back to your home that may or may not have a street address why do I say all of that\nBecause if you can do all of that you can go to the county courthouse where the election board is with the county clerk and you can fill out an affidavit as to what your addresses\nAnd you can probably cast a provisional ballot or more than likely if you fill out an affidavit under penalty of perjury that you live at such and such place you live in that particular house and Senate district you live in a particular congressional district\nYou're probably going to be allowed to vote\nIt just means that you have to make your next trip so while you're making your trip to the post office to pick up your government check or whatever else you're picking up\nYou can just walk right over to the courthouse and fill out that David Eric\nHolder tweets outrageous hash outrageous slash unjust Republicans in North Dakota make it harder for Native Americans devote requiring street

example of the great cultural divide\nThe left wants to scream somehow that its voter suppression\nWe went to the screen that its ballot integrity gets assuring that only those who are qualified to vote actually vote who could be opposed to that who can be opposed\nTo making certain that only the people who are qualified to vote actually vote in an election\nOh yeah probably those who want

future and you\nKnow I Know in the past you needed more males is that still the case\nYeah we typically need about sixty percent males and forty percent females because we we see that that typically mostly in in that's the breakout because just the the blaze you know they need a little bit of extra help so we need a lot of men that are willing to step up\nAnd and be that positive male adult role model but of course we we use females and our gladly are able to accept them\nNow if somebody wants to do this what how do they sign up\nSo I'm In a direct them to our website Diablo United Way dot\nOrg slash mentor good information there they can sign up they can apply and again you just have to pass a background check we do an interview with the perspective mentors just to line them up with the student that we think they'll let you have and then we do a training just to give a\nProse on and plates on how to best interact with the kid but if you can listen you can do that it's not a tutoring program\nIt's just that positive adult\nRole model ... which we all probably have somewhere in our past\nYeah have you back you know we all know there's so many that made a difference I mean

[laughter] yeah I'm\nVintage NASA\nVox dot com the headline is the Senate represent states not people that's the problem\nIs up heading is states as states do need representation\nIn the federal government but under the constitution they have far too much well in that a cropper malarkey\nYeah I wanted to say something else there\n\nBut of course the fact that the constitution does something isn't the same is that something being good we continue to debate the constitution itself and specifically the disproportional Senate\nYes our intuition tells us that there's something wrong when a minority has that much power we should pay attention\nThe sin is equal representation of states not people should be discussed\nOn its merits I don't think it stands up\nThis is one of the ... too but his articles I think I've ever read why do you think we have two senators\nFor every state because the Senate was supposed to represent stay in the Senate no longer represents states the Senate now represents the entire population of a state\n\nThe whole idea behind the Senate by behind having a bike ham role legislature or lower house an an opera house\nWas based on one simple fact that I think most Americans don't know\n\nThe federal government didn't form the states the state's formed the federal government the states are supposed to be\nOver the federal government\nExcept in those areas where the Congress and the constitution gives the federal government certain enumerated powers the idea behind a by camera legislature was that the lower house would be divided among the several states\nSo that the population would be represented\nProportionately so that individuals\nCould be close to their representatives that go to Washington to represent them for example the population of Colorado has increased so substantially that we will probably get an additional idol thing too but at least one additional congressman after the next\nSince some states have one congressman still have two senators\nBecause the idea was you wanted to equalize out heavily populated state\nWith less densely populated state\nAll the power to start spending money to raise tax was supposed to start in the house of representatives so that the people if we get pissed off enough which we don't get pissed off enough", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Caplis Show", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "16"}
