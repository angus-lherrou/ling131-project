X but when I go to the cross tabs on by you know\nA B.

C. and go to Georgetown Prep like ... and you could I could just come up with a metro we could just walk down the street and we could point out oh there simply from west in Mississippi and they're both from inside the\nBeltway the grew up inside the beltway absolutely like I say all of that to this point\nYou would be the political junkie as we are and we you and I both watched all of Susan Collins speech today\nI just if you don't know Susan Collins announced they forty five minutes speech that she was going to vote for the confirmation of judge covered all the close of debates sometime tomorrow afternoon I was\nSusan Collins and I have ... we've had a rocky relationship over the past twenty some years and\nI came to a conclusion throughout the capital here all of the capital's stuff after watching Lindsey Graham mhm now Susan Collins today I came to this conclusion that was the biggest thing for me I have criticized both of them\nVigorously in the past and what dawned on me today was that my differences with Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins has been over policy issues mhm\nBut when it came down to them dealing with the constitutional role of the vice can see it they were ... they were absolutely spot on\nI I agree I I agree ... and it was a tough day today to be a U.S senator and so that was in the ... I mean you'd they really are in the ...\nUm when you have the entire nation a hanging on your every word of the nation divided very divided like matter what especially for Susan with all due respect I mean it's funny 'cause I'm One of my very first campaigns was in Maine in Nineteen Ninety four Jim knowingly in in up in Portland and I remember season was running and we didn't know the Ninety\nFour way was necessarily ensue in without by far was gonna wait and I remember when she won and she's a very nice woman and I've known her in some of her friends you know years and years ago\nUm but Maine is a very independent state they have an independent rights you know they've they've elected in ... governors before and um it's main yes but at the same time the elect conservative ... you know like they didn't see it as intense um\nBut it was a difficult vote for her and not just because she's up in two thousand twenty and it's you know likely to be you know a ... year more younger voters are going to turn out to vote but I Do agree and I think that um\nThe case that she made and her reasoning behind arriving at our decision today was was very well uh laid out a\n... I I Would encourage people to give them if you if you didn't see a ... let me make very clear you will see snippets of his speech on TV Tonight and over the weekend but I Would encourage listeners to go on line either go to the Senate website or go to her her ... her so the website\nWhere I'm sure it's a good fight on YouTube or something to watch the entire forty five minutes here's a woman that\nI knew them and she sort of\nA new or should we do so I knew it was going to be with us [noise] with the way she laid out who reason [noise] even dealing with the issue of doctor for the fall of her testimony viewed as a speech worth watching [noise] absolutely\nAbsolutely it wasn't necessarily partisan and I think her among\nAll we can take a break okay I Can't hear anything apparently we have to take a break ... ... ... to leave with whatever the Michael Brown will be right back\nLike twenty five wide open in directions on your drive to the city ... boulevard looking good has well fourth street is problem frantic sailing on highway the overall a nice quiet drive you should have no problem getting wherever you might be headed I'm Janine rather rent traffic\nIt's to a terrorist attack you know so I I Will respond to that I\nJust I don't either I I I cringe to think about it and you know knock on wood that doesn't happen on anybody's watch\nDo you think that that we're polarized because we really have it and I'm asking is because this is partly my theory so feel free to rip it apart\nIs that we have the sides have been pushing apart because we truly do have almost a black and white view of the country should be this versus the country should be that the vast become so\nStark that something's going to finally pushes one direction will be over for either going to end up being a socialist democratic European country right or we're going to get back to more of a free market fruit capitalism not crony capitalism type of economic system I'm\nGoing to be really honest about this okay and we do say this out of our shop we don't drink the Kool Aid even though Republican leader for him okay who I think the downturn of two thousand eight so many Americans lost their security their savings you know they're number one asset\nThey they build well no the value their home wrote on then we got thrown into two thousand eight and ... won that election in a landslide wrote exciting I think the federal a legislative session of two thousand nine is slowly and a two thousand ten with Obamacare and the AC a coming on and all of that\nReally led a fire and a lot of voters you know you know how should I say just they were physically lapsed voters are out there but the amount of seizing getting government to solve our problems are a problem created basically the majority in Congress that we have today we've been running on that for eight years\nGive Donald Trump if you don't believe that he has perhaps stoked or\nCreated some of the education that is involved in our politics for I see this in my research all the time to be honest with you I called brown where very frankly you know what do you think of President Trump to\n... I I see open ended responses and we see it in some of our focus groups where we have people saying the negativity he's so combative he won't listen to his own advisors he picks fights with everybody everybody whether he's beating up attorney general route you know the attorney general for not standing by hand and firing call me or not\nI mean I'm Donald Trump's behavior the president's ... unfortunately he goes about\nAddressing the American public and being so combative feeds that frustration and anger without question especially in the middle it makes people feel uncomfortable\nBut particularly here to Colorado you want to be honest about it\nBecause we have so many people moving here our cost of living has gone through the roof ... it is pushing or right yeah it is at the root of many of the problems that voters want salt rate today do they want to be able to afford an apartment they want it for to home they want to the cost of living go down that has them angry and frustrated\nBecause it's things beyond their control their kids or their families cannot necessarily get that\nAnd I feel that from time to time when the president is tweeting or perhaps picking a fight in his own way in his own New York wrote however you want to ... feet said agitation\nBut so that we are [noise] are perhaps more ready to pick a fight with somebody that we ever have that um ... under our current\nFrom Obama to Donald Trump to different things where ... says ... rather than perhaps try to leave with the silent majority if you will [noise] he's leading to the frustration

to talk radio would find informative because he'd read easy to understand it might help them understand exactly what's going on in this crazy a third third third state\nYeah and I would hope so I mean because we we do include documents that are very intense crowded as I tried to write my summers dropped tables in here and say hey here's how this breaks out by Democrat Republican independent age group\nGender you know men and women if you're just curious what to look like and try to make it a little bit easier for people to see oh that's interesting walkers leading by four points among men and among women here it's got a larger lead to a you know and so people can get a little bit beyond just straight up you know forty seven Jerry you know forty whatever for Walker\nAnd so on the way down here today [noise] uh\nI was listening to a slip between Fox News and CNN MSNBC and other whether Frank loves was quoting another pollster or water or food over somebody talked about the enthusiasm factor yes and that the enthusiasm poll you guys do\nShow that you ... among Republicans have jumped up about twelve point a there was already higher ... for Democrats but it also increase but only by about two points what do you think you ... in Colorado\nI you know I'll be honest with you I we will have a hard data on that are coming out within about ten days 'cause we we are going in the fields were going to be measuring that resenting that and I hope you know encourage people to learn that\nHere's the difference that Democrats in younger unaffiliated voters do not turn out to vote in his large numbers as Republicans do why is that\nTo be very honest with you a folks that identified they're registered Republicans tend to be older they had to pay attention more and they vote in non presidential your elections more often and just to give you an idea for example like in two thousand fourteen out of all of the registered\nRepublicans at the time and there was roughly one point one million of them sixty eight percent of them turned out to vote in two thousand fourteen Orlando non presidential election looking at Democrats though on the other hand only fifty nine percent of their voters turned out to vote in two thousand fourteen\nWhy is that well more Democrats are perhaps younger younger voters forty four Ninety or typically do not pay attention as much a turn out to vote they're harder group to turn out to be very honest with you but that's gosh that's gone back since Nineteen Ninety two when I surely identities racket has always been\nA it's more of a challenge for Democrats to turn out their voters during a non presidential cycle you\nAnd you know so but I think right now\nA Donald Trump Kavanaugh olive sort of the main forces in played at our energizing folks to get up off their couch and vote 'em\n... I feel like the Democrat intensity is coming up to match Republican city but I don't have data at this time it was a yeah it's ten points I took a hit you forget your data for a minute okay\nSo we're talking today with clarity for ... yes so we had this crescendo ... today on the cloture vote and then Susan Collins mansion coming out of a bathroom they would vote so it appears that we're going to get Brett Kavanaugh as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court that fired up\nAnger whatever you might want to call them both sides because of this confirmation process when the bell extra\nWeek of October Fifteen so really going to be getting around over Eighteen so\nWhat we what we've seen over the past few days yeah how how sustainable is that do you think\nIt will all wrote some among Republicans more than\n... for those of you are watching I'm watching the besides I've tried to see OK er road what does that really mean how much of what do you think it'll it\nMade a little bit honestly if Brett Kavanaugh had not been nominated it would've been the best\nThing happened the Republican Party cage\nThere's fewer if you if you you mean if you're not thinking for if you if you had not been confirmed to\nThe Republican base that we'd be yeah that would exceed anything by their Republican strategist greatest dreams and that's why like same sex marriage on the ballot that gets Republican voters up off the couch are very very intense voters when it comes to issues of a life and so forth um but since\nBrett is up as apparently going to make it to the court\nUm I Would say they would give a slight edge to Democrats they really have something to point you to get that unlike the opposite of absolutely just the opposite so now I think the Democrats have a slight advantage it will still far up Republicans sure no doubt about it but they're going to run with it and see we have been denied\nA woman's right has not been heard they allow it I mean I've seen stuff on Twitter today that I haven't seen a long time but I mean that is extremely rotational yeah um\nBut I think that you have to give a slight advantage to the Democrats on intensity because of\nWhat he got what we what yes so we were fired up it was like somebody\nPut into dot you're right they're going to feel like hey you know I Believe for all of those rally cry\nOr go to are gonna be like the big question is does it extend beyond for about ... you know be on the Democrats thing because you have plenty Democrat went in there is a serious with Donald Trump's presidency they're already there\nSo to hold that thought absolutely took it as ... we're going to talk about Colorado politics Linux does sound stick around Raqqa [noise]\nYou're listening to them Michael Brown\nTo Denison Fox News with three swing senators announcing their plans to vote yes it appears the Senate is likely to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow Republican Senator Susan Collins and Jeff Flake along with Democrat Joe Manchin today announcing they will vote yes\nUm [noise] if you look at the ones that voted in the primary just so you know a hundred and Seventy five thousand of them because this was a you know the first time in the June primary wrote that they could vote which is interesting new observation for us political observers to follow a hundred and Seventy five thousand vote in the Democratic primary a hundred thousand voted in the Republican primary\nBut from our modeling data we know among these one point three million unaffiliated voters they do lean Democrat\nThey do tend to be younger um but they don't vote is often perhaps however um you know the voters that religious ... elections they do make up a solid Fifteen Percent of that they're in there\nThere are Republican women that you tend to be more moderate and will consider cancer both parties through the number of registered Democrats as a smaller number if you will um but surprisingly they're not as young as you think they're not like a bunch a young\n... they're not that millennial group that everybody kind of ... there but\nThey're in there but you'd be surprised a lot of on a ... came on the rules during the Obama administration you thought during those years that hey ah they're all going to register is Deborah these young kids are so far the first African American president roast that's not really what happened in fact there was a ton of younger voters still remained unaffiliated 'cause they didn't weren't exactly sure what they were\nAnd that kind of maintain through where it is today however what's different is like nearly fifty percent of registered voters that are forty for another in Colorado are an affiliate\nIn two thousand six that number was his lowest twenty five for so well at the expense of the Republican majority Republicans right now only make up roughly twenty two percent of all registered voters that are forty four now under\nThat used to not happened like in my days in the nineties it the Republican National committee when I was ... and so forth\nEventually when people became in their young thirties they would choose one Saturday at her you know I never mortgage I understand taxes or I have a job I'd like to keep more money or I like what they're saying about schools and you fell in one pocket or the other and the Democrat Republican parties both got their fair share if you will at least in the state like Colorado and they used to be more Republican if you will\nThat's not happening anymore in Colorado now it is just everybody's so frustrated with both parties that but you know Republicans or Democrats were like treading water Republicans are really though falling behind all you have yeah they have to have really have in the expense of at the expense of unaffiliated again\nOkay so indebted to feel you watched uh if if they are just interested to some degree did was even driving them out to vote\nNumber one issue among using the unity\nOf voters more than ... yes that's all I Do all my focus groups guess what I don't bother talking to Republicans and Democrats you know uh yeah we knew what pocket you're going to go ... unaffiliated voters they're the ones that really decide to understanding them what their fears are what they want out of their elected officials were problems they won't solve really is a big key to\nScare me which humans cycle [laughter] [noise]\nRight now it's really a tie it's number one is public education hooker especially among unaffiliated women that you consider candidates of both parties\nAre those the old saw what we call the soccer mom I don't mean to you or over but they are\nThey well they are the soccer moms absolutely because here's what they see the rising cost of living touching everything and they know thirty five thousand dollar salary teacher cannot afford to live in certain neighborhoods of school districts in our Fatah in\n... right exactly and that's why you know the the teacher movement and the you know being out there in in you know marching on the capital but not you know making their case her shirt on this past ... we need more pay\nThat's exactly what they echo because even though twenty five percent and say that's my number one issue I Want saw public education what do you want you know we always do a follow up question well that's great that means different things to people sure what she'd be done to improve it overwhelmingly in this environment is we need to pay our teachers more we need a trach for quality teachers we need more money in the classroom and ...\nWhy can't Republicans latch on because what you just said I'm Mr conservative as I can buy into every one of those things you just so\nCan only put the information out my oh we can't afford to go in that direction and I'm not saying that you know walk a staple tens campaign hasn't he pointed out a lot of areas and\nEducation or because of our elected officials in the legislature will look more towards well they're spending money so they can reallocate money and so forth\nWhich I agree with that too absolutely we do but the perception right now you have to deal with the perception that messaging and communicate directly to that perception right now is you need to speak more around that they need to pay most people don't know it's the school district perhaps that actually makes\nThe decision again not just made out of money that's number one number two residents of member to anything so you learn you know radio like

my body can you see us Jay [noise]\n\n\n... audience buddy bought the book as much as what we can\nAre big flare these big long before we\nEnded up shutting down here six o'clock I Want to repeat how much you appreciate your coming down to them this evening I'm Talking with me I'm sure you're incredible ... expertise would I what is it Michael I was with us more between now and November I Hope we do I would love that you know\nYou were talking before the break about the youngest of well your voters if I was talking about the economy and how it frustrates me as a\nTraditional Republican why we're not out there talking about how great the economy is ... you know we go GDP Growth and doing all this stuff\nAnd you were about to explain why unaffiliated voters\nKind of look at the ... or maybe not even an affiliate voters I shouldn't narrow it down to the right\nIf they don't just said everything there's plenty of ... votes up for grabs among Republicans and Democrats too if you make the case it really that is true like the candidate matters and their message truly does matter\nAnd you know I had this conversation during the break about it's really a double edged sword because a ... ... people are looking at what's happening and it's not necessarily translating to them\nOr a four point oh GDP or right this record high right unemployment\nLike my wages are up like if you are non college degree new household a yeah where they feel like hey we're we're really feeling it we're doing good you know what we are going to go you know by\nThat new Ford F. one fifty you know what I mean and and and feel good about things or put a lot more money and you know what I'm going to even though Trump may be difficult as well I'm going to give him some credit or give the Republicans for credit because all this is happening under a federal Republican uh you know because\nTraditionally Republican would be ... right now at all about how great the economy is wages are going up everything we bitch about for a year that's right we're now seeing just the reverse of it but I either I don't hear it\nOr it's getting drowned out is why I'm not working hard enough to go find it sure and then the other the flipside of that is what we're talking about on the brake\nYeah we see all these things happening but it doesn't translate into my ability to buy a Ford F. one fifty it doesn't translate into me being able to buy a home if I moved here 'cause I saw how great the economy was so I moved here I'm from California yesterday I moved here from New Mexico yup and I can't do anything\nRight it's the cost of living having gone up that's why Colorado perhaps as unique I don't know if the you know people moving here okay has driven up the cost of housing\nAnd also touched a lot of other things I've seen in focus groups women saying yeah the economy's better and maybe make a little bit more money but everything else that I have to pay for has gone up to it's interesting because I'll ask them you know there's two transportation proposals on the ballot one's going to raise taxes by point six percent and the other proposals says\nNo the legislature you have to live within your means and put two percent roughly you know what I mean toward transportation\nWhat are you going to go for it and these are folks that are just sitting in traffic you know take some Fifteen minutes to go to the king super nice only take them five and you know they all agree to transportation it's just gotten worse\nTo like without question I'm putting gets that tax increase it's like why because you feel you can afford it they're like no because I'm working as hard as I can just to keep up I don't feel like I'm getting a hitter and it's in a lot of it is a tribute to in Colorado especially on the front range for it in other areas but for the most part\nPeople feel that the cost of everything has gone up it's almost like we're feeling Colorado inflation due to the you know which a lot of it's being driven by this new population search that we are experiencing and have an experience for the last couple of years so", "show_name": "Dan Caplis Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day":
