all Donald Trump's fault you see Donald Trump made us polarized and because he says such mean things the logic goes\nNow more and more people are being ugly on social media including this free job who shot up a synagogue matter of fact he said some ugly things on social media before he went to do the deed\nObviously this is Trump's fault it's going to the phones thrilled three seven on three to five five Hey Eric you're with John killed there are so glad that\nYou John how you doing this evening I afternoon I was born and raised in Pittsburgh not not that that I don't want it to the point of view I'm Sorry brass on ... or\nI or I'm going to be honest with your John I I have a hard time\nGrasping the notion that this is somehow the president's fault\nOr you you talked about this because think about the increase of anti Semitism\nI don't think any of us I don't care where you are on the political spectrum I don't think any of us believe that there isn't prejudice and bigotry not only in this country but throughout the world but you know John I have a real problem with the whole hate crime legislation\nBecause to me the fact that they hate Jews that's evidence of motive\nIt does it make killing eleven people better worse it doesn't mitigate it it doesn't compounded\nIn my argument is the argument is that it does make it worse let me let me throw up the argument then respond to it\nThe reason it's worse because he targeted to these people based on their face that they are Jewish therefore by attacking them he is making it\nA much more fearful for Ole Jewish people everywhere in the same way that a cross burning on someone's lawn might be a crime against that person that African American who lives in that home but really it's meant to scare\nAll African Americans and then that way it's a hate crime can be a response\nWell my response is two fold up first and foremost you had the shooting in South Carolina a couple of years ago at a black church OK I'm hate tends to despise religion\nPeople who hate tend not to do so except uh gifts you know I mean I guess you want to counter with certain Islamic sects but by and large hate is an absence of religion is not\nI don't know if not most religions\nYou know I don't I don't know or a because I just don't know and I there is something I listen I I agree with you I'm not a fan of what's called hate laws I I think they're overused and you see I think the danger of quote hate speech is really just to censor people\nThat being said I Will tip my hat to the notion that\nA crime like this\nImpacts a group of people more so than ... and they didn't have in mind ranger strangers in a room\nIt it is a hate crime but but the but the point I was making bringing up the whole hate crime legislation nowadays John I feel that a whole lot of crime this one excludes because of his rhetoric okay so let's let's let's acknowledge upfront\nFor more rewarding vacation tried choosing a location with the culture you are interested in then you can book accommodations that let you come in contact with the people who may if they're\nA great way to do this is by staying in a place where the kitchen such as a timeshare

may\nWell below thinks we're listening to the Michael Brown show him five Ninety to see us\nAnd I was just one room but\nSt minutes for the top I'm John Caldera in for the vacationing recovering let's just say it he's on some bender Michael Brown give me a call three oh three seven one three eight to five five seven won three talk the word is narrative\nAnd he who controls the narrative usually wins\nThe media controls the narrative\nWhat's the old saying don't get into arguments with somebody who buys their ink by the barrel that means\nThey they have a way of getting their viewpoints out it gets repeated and repeated and repeated it gets echoed because one new sources pretty much like all the other news sources even though they think they're wildly different\nAnd they all hate Donald Trump there's just no question about it which is entertaining to me because they have no idea that they're smuggling is in the media they're elite isn't there sticky sweetness\n\nIs what caused Donald Trump\nHe is a reaction to them thinking that that they're better [laughter]\nIs that the best way to put it so the narrative that the media is going to pull on this is that there wasn't any ugliness in political discourse on to Donald Trump came along\nSo as you may or may not know I run the independence Institute\nI've been in political battles now for a quarter century here in Colorado oh we do things like proposition one oh nine which you should vote yes for which gets us new roads without a tax increase\nA lot of people on the left don't like it because they would prefer the tax increase\nThe money that's coming into the state governments going to get spent one way or another but by bonding for roads it means that the future governor whoever he may be cannot take that money and spend it on trolley cars or even more Medicaid expansion\nSo I I put these things out and I'm going to tell you for the quarter of a century that I've been doing this type of stuff\nAnd it's been ugly it's been ugly I've been called every name in the book I get hate mail that would make you lush\nI ride a calm weekly for the Denver Post\nThe comments are hateful just hateful not no I I think Mr ... wrong and and here's why he says this but I really think a better point would be that no no no it's it's personal attacks\nI have a Facebook page and a Twitter page by all means at John Caldera please follow me ... Caldera\nAnd I'm Amazed what comes off of people's fingertips\nSo to have a president or guy running for office who has just been doing what so many on the left already do but forcing it out there and bringing the ugliness forward I don't find\nAs vulgar I find it\nGod should I say it almost refreshing why because we've been seeing it for decades we've been seeing the intolerance for decades so somehow and I knew this was going to happen\nThey're going to try to tie the caravan of Central American immigrants coming up a through Mexico to to this violence yes to this violence here's here's how the logic goes I heard it on NPR so you know it's got to be true\nThat\nThe guy who shot up the synagogue did so because he believed Jewish people were conspiring to get the caravan up here\nNow I have no idea if that's true or not but just just for a fact that it it's thrown out there as the motivation and this is why Trump is responsible for the shooting that's how loony this gets\n\nSo the Anti Defamation league is reporting that there are more hate crimes in the last year than ever on record\nIf true I find that pretty shocking\n\nBut let me throw out the statisticians I'm concerned it goes something like this whatever you measure you get more of\nMy sense is more hate crimes get reported since Trump has been elected because people have been sensitized to hurt\nPeople believe that Trump equals racism and therefore things that might have might have slipped by in the past\nWell they they are now hate crimes and therefore they're getting reported more you're that are there actually are more hate crimes which would be awful it'd be hard to explain that to me\nAnd I don't understand how from\nWould be the symbol of anti Semitism as one of our callers pointed out when he finally did what every other presidents said they were going to do but never did move our embassy\n\nHow was that anti Semitic helped me understand this give me a call three oh three seven won three to five five seven to one three top I'm John ... activity here\nMaybe Casey that's J.\nSprings Colorado was news of an double accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety Casey has Jay I'm Helen has changed their lives gears they one of our very first customer\nHollering my own hair is easier than I ever imagined the best part I no longer had to sit in a salon and pay over a hundred dollars to have this done now I ... when it's convenient for me\nAnd it takes less than an hour people complement me on how great my tolerance and my hair is incredibly San in healthy looking experience beautiful\nMulti dimensional ammonia fried salon policy color for under twenty five dollars and joined the hundreds of thousands of women who have tried and loved Madison Reid\nFind your perfect shade and Madison dash free dot com and get ten percent off plus free shipping on your first caller can't use code trust that code trust and try and love it that's the beauty of Madison\nRead by Casey yesterday was\nDi di di di di di di\nDi di ... Fox News forty six year old Robert Bauer it's brought into court and Pittsburgh in a wheelchair the truck driver could face the death penalty\nDrew magistrate read the twenty ninth federal charges he's facing for killing eleven people at the tree of life sanctuary according to the FBI the Pittsburgh native repeatedly expressed desire to kill all Jews on Saturday\nMy thing is the man was partially elected because he is so politically incorrect and vulgar\n\nBecause that's what's been going on the left has been vulgar the left has been mean they have attacked\nI see it every day on Twitter or don't don't tell me that our site isn't guilty too yeah yeah conservatives are just as guilty\nBut there's something else though there is this this one two punch that the left gives one when they're being ugly and working on the politics of personal destruction we saw that with Kavanaugh\nWe saw what the Clintons did to their bimbo eruptions we understand how they attack people on a personal level\n\nSo they they say it's okay they give the example I should say that it's okay but if anybody tries to reciprocate then they say that's offensive\nWe put it this way so if there was a nut job on the right and he is tweeting away and being vulgar and calling names\nYes that's awful and the left will respond\nBut the left might be putting out vulgar terrible things but then they say you can't do the same you can't do the same to us because then you're a racist or then you'll vulgar order then you're dangerous\nAnd I think it's that dichotomy of\nOf act the way I say you should act don't don't act the way that I act\n\nIt's it's really ingenious when you think about it so\nThe only way you can win when you're in these battles with the left is just shut the hell up which is exactly what they want and I believe for the better part of a decade that's what a lot of America has done they shut the hell up\nIn fact I could read into something like last year's NFL\nFight over taking a need for so many Americans said forget this I'm I'm not playing any longer and people got upset now the luck would say no you're being racist and I think a lot of Americans said no I'm turning off my TV\n'cause I don't need to see spoiled brats disrespect the country for no apparent reason\n\nI think Donald Trump is a spark that says it's OK to stand up\nAnd and not be told to shut up and that's exactly what the media is doing so a guy in the Jewish community in Pittsburgh where the president is set to uh visit tomorrow says the president is not welcome\nNot until he denounces white nationalism\n\nNot until he denounces white nationalism which I'm pretty sure he's already done probably hundreds of times what you just can't do it enough in order to appease left you you got to commit Harry Carey on a stage and spill out your guts and an ask for major forgiveness\n\nShould Donald Trump asked for forgiveness should he should he say I'm against white nationalism now can I come to Pittsburgh and pay my respects\n\nWhat I don't get is it seems as though he's he's getting it from both ends it was wrong for him to move the embassy to Jerusalem so the left hated him for that but somehow he's responsible\nFor these shootings of Jewish people in a synagogue so on one hand he he was caving in\nTo the homeland for Jewish people he was caving in to Jewish interests at the same time he's anti Semitic it causes a little cognitive dissonance for me\nBut then again there are things I just don't quite understand three oh three seven one three eight to five five seven one three talk talk back and like that and get my east coast on\nSo there's an interesting website called slow facts fast opinions come and go here slow facts and I really don't know much about the guy who writes us maybe he's a whack job maybe not\nYeah asked this question after the burgers at the Pittsburgh synagogue I keep seeing this question\nHow do we stop mass murder most of the people asking this question feel strongly about things they don't understand they have not studied the issues of physical defense or contemporary mental health sorry to give them the bad news but there is no magic button\nTo fix this human condition notice he didn't say silver bullet because I Would not have worked\nHe said we can reduce it ... this was fascinating\nAh any puts out three plans and most interesting lasers third point I'll get into these after the break but it's\n\nIt's the second one that says almost\nAll mass murders are in so called gun free zone\nSo make the government strictly
