that I'm probably the greatest risk take her in the world was having a conversation with my lawyer the other day and he made a comment\nHe listens to this program religiously like all like the rest of your show like what's wrong with you my lawyer can do it why can't you and we were talking about somehow we got off on\nI think we were talking about something to do with the Senate or the house\nBut in any way I ... at any point at some point he made the comment I Love it when you are willing to say just the unvarnished truth\nAbout a Republican or a Democrat or whoever it might be and I made a and I made the comment joined kind of off handed Lee where you see it because I don't care I don't care anymore\nOnce you reach that point where you do the endless I've said this is a bunch of times before do I care about what my family thinks of course I Do I care about what Angie thanks well sometimes well okay we'll watch more\nWhat I mean by not caring is\nYou have to be able and willing to risk a lot\nIn order to gain a lot and my lawyer retort right back to me I should say retort his response to it was it's it's not that you don't care because you always do care it's just that you've been killed once and they can't kill you again and so you don't care\nWhat they think or say because they can't kill you again\nAnd that kind of feeds into the whole the whole thing the the whole monitor that you hear that you know what doesn't kill you actually makes you stronger\nWell when I made the comment about Cory bookers idea that we're going to give these poor kids fifty grand and they can use it for things for things like the down payment on a house or college tuition some people either texted me on the text line or on the set it on\nYouTube or Facebook now fifty thousand ... ... ... where do you get the idea that fifty grand is enough for a down payment on a house\nThere are a lot of places\nWhere you can buy a mansion for two hundred thousand dollars now as of Denver is a Colorado in general no is it Texas probably not but there are rural areas in Kansas Nebraska Oklahoma the Dakotas there there there are places all over this country\nWere fifty thousand dollars is double what you need for a down payment\nThe problem is is that people are not willing to take the risk because somebody said to me well not everybody can pack up and\nMove that's not true you can if you want to everybody can do almost anything they want to do that well why ever be a first baseman for the Colorado Rockies no\nI'm within the all the really the bat boy for the Colorado Rockies would I Love to be the first baseman for the Colorado Rockies in a heartbeat\nBut I'm also realistic to know that that is not a realistic dream\nBut if you have a realistic dream the only thing that keeps you from accomplishing that is your unwillingness to take risk somebody you're when YouTube just said you know what I did\nI sold my house I think I think it was different if you can scroll through the comments again but I sold my house in Denver move I think the Fort Lauderdale or somewhere bought a house twice the size had enough left over to buy a rental house and I'm the I'm Down here dumb fat and happy making money because I was willing to take the risk\n\nBut most people are willing to do that he goes back to the story I mentioned at the\nTop of the hour about this so called

you're going to hear tomorrow night for example in the lead seats that about a guy that took a great risk he took a great risk I Know it's All right let's eat\nBut he took a great risk\nTo save his

and it's hard I'm not saying that any of this is easy what I'm saying is if you really want to do it you can't\nIn virtually what I'm saying is most people really don't want to do most people are
