years later so aren't you wrong really kept talking about the Democrats moving the goalposts on the Kavanaugh confirmations the ... moving the goalposts on climate change too\nWe now know that the

eleven years and no\nWell we have seen a decline in admissions for the for all on a global basis for the first time they've stabilized and started to decline so some of the responses of the last ten years have helped\nOr think about the missions have the claw\nSo wouldn't there be a corresponding decrease in what ever climate change effects are caused by increased emissions\nBut uh unfortunately and regrettably a lot of serious damage has been done Greenland for example is losing one Cuban kilometer buys every single day\nSo we've reduced just take take a look I'm not this not dispute Al Gore's fat because Al Gore's Fox live in his brain and that's why\nHe admits that there's been an overall reduction in emissions so you would think that there would be slowing down of whatever climate
