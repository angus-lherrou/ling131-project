Jay\n[noise]\n\n\nJohn Roberts is focused first time since the confirmation of ... capital\nYou spoke at the University of Minnesota law school\nAnd he reminded everybody that the Supreme Court does not speak for a job as or political parties that the Supreme Court only speaks for the United States Constitution yeah I Know many of you including myself are frustrated with justice chief justice Roberts\nFor his decision in the Obamacare case\nInserting himself\nClaiming that Obamacare is valid because it's a tax then because it's a tax Congress has the authority to tax and so therefore Obamacare's constitutional when nobody\nEither proponents or opponents of Obamacare ever argue that it was a tax\nSo you can take what chief justice Roberts says with a grain of salt\nBut I Do believe that it still bears merit it's that theme I've been stuck on for the past ten days or so that you could actually have two conflicting thoughts in your head at the same time and live with both of them\nAre still think the Justice Roberts was wrong on Obamacare and if you ever read if you ever really sat down and read the decision you would see that he jumped through all these convoluted hoops to make ... constitutional he actually made the argument\nOn behalf of the GOP instead of taking the government's argument at face value but by the same token I take what he says at the University of Minnesota law school and say hallelujah you are exactly correct\nBefore I sit down with professor Stein for the main event um I thought I Would spend a moment or two touching upon the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks\nI Will not criticized the political branches we do that often enough in our opinions about what I Would like to do briefly is emphasized how the judicial branch is how it must be\nVery different\nI have great respect for our public officials\nAfter all they speak for the people and that commands a certain degree of humility from those in the ... of us in the judicial branch who do not we do not speak for the people but we speak for the constitution\nOur role is very clear we are to interpret the constitution and laws of the United states and ensure that the political branches act\nWithin them that\nJob obviously requires independence from the political branches\nThe story of the Supreme Court would be very different without that sort of independence without independence there is no brown versus board of education without independence there is no West Virginia versus Barnett\nWhere the court held that the government could not compel schoolchildren to salute the flag\nAnd without independence there is no steel seizure case where the court held that President Truman was subject to the constitution even at a time of war\nNow the court has from time to time aired an air greatly but when it has it has been because the court yielded to political pressure\nAs the Korematsu case shameful Lee upholding the tournament thrown during World War two of Japanese American citizens\nThose of us on the court know that the best way to do our job is to work together\nIn a collegial way I'm not talking about mirror civility although that helps I Am instead talking about a shared commitment to a genuine exchange of ideas and views through each step of the decision process\nWhich is something that we liked him a public hearing they're able to do a behind the both the doors of the U.S Supreme Court he's about to explain to you how they do their part of it\nBut if we could just do\nIt I don't know why we can I get I mean I I get angry at people will do mastery opinions but I still like to hear their opinions because usually if you're a good listener they'll give you enough holes to drive a Mack truck through\nOr enough rope to hang them four or five times over\n... goes a long way toward just having a strange ideas\nWe need to know each step\nThat we are in this together\nThere is a concrete expression of that ... in a tradition at the court\nThat has prevailed for over a century before we go on to the bench to hear argument in the case and before we go into the conference room to discuss the case we pause for a moment and shake each other's hand\nIt's a small thing perhaps but is it is a repeated reminder that\nAs our newest colleagues put it we do not sit on opposite sides of an ...\nWe do not caucus in separate rooms we do not serve one party or one interest we serve one nation\nAnd I want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that for the best of our abilities whether times are calm or contentious\n[noise]

don't know but western mainstream media\nHave mainly been presenting to show you as a liberal journalist that opposed the regime of the purported Saudi modernizing crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nKnown as India's crown prince ...\nI'd like to know where that started is it just too hard to say Mohammed bin Salman the western narrative goes the NBS had him killed because he really wasn't a modernized to modernize riddle\nAccordingly NBS ... show you kill\nA rival analysis has been doing the rounds the show he was actually Muslim extremists the former friend of Osama bin Laden some of you submitted a picture from the Nineteen nineties of bin Laden and to show you together in some desert\nOutlive somewhere there to show you as an act collide with the Muslim Brotherhood I don't necessarily do that but he was a hater of Israel who called and all Arabs to join the resistance against it and who opposed crown prince NBS not because he was undemocratic because he was not Islamic enough\nBut even so\nWhy would NBS have to show get killed in this complicated macabre and political exposed way why does it need Fifteen men to do that why kill him at all as was also reported to show his criticisms of envy yes had been relatively mild\n\nSources that are beginning to read provide answers to some of these questions in an even more startling account\nThey say that to show he was indeed still very much in Islam was connected to the Muslim Brotherhood but much more significantly he was intimately connected to the Saudi regime\nThis is bitterly opposed to the Brotherhood he was there for the ultimate insider that had gone rogue one of the stories that I read says he was the Saudi intelligence service asset for more than Twenty years it was his report\nIn Nineteen Ninety four that Osama bin Laden was was inextricably under the influence of Egypt and the Brotherhood that convinced the Saudis bin Laden was a lost cause\nHow many if you've ever heard because all we ever hear or\nA level of the of the nine eleven attackers were from were Saudis okay\nHow many uh MS hurting gang members currently in the United states or Guatemalan I mean I think that's a fact without any much meaning to it\nJust shows you work closely with the former directors of the Saudi intelligence agency he worked with a ... you worked with prince bend or been sold them their most importantly he was the architect of Saudi intelligence brigadier general useful followed the Siri\nThose people had no problem with him being out of the country but he knew a lot of intelligence secrets so when he got too close to the Qataris into the Turks who are now the arch enemies of the Saudis that's when the show really cross the line\nDo you know there was fiance a Turkish diplomat is the daughter of a former advisor to Turkey's Islam was president or to want to show you started tweeting pictures of himself with while the bars remember turkey and the Saudis are mortal mortal enemies at this point\nTo show he was also planning to start to turkey sooner funded by the Turks and the Qataris\nNow if you're getting resorting Muslim center it was going to be funded by the Qataris and by the Turks piss off the Saudis the meaning of the dissenters the show he was chipping whereas llamas opposed to the attempts by India's to modernize the Saudi economy\nI'm Saudi society it is a complex you
