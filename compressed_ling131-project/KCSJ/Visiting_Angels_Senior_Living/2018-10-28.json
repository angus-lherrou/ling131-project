Khan about is I think I Want to help my daughter with a dry wall\nHere in the bathroom and it we're quite a paper holder is attached to the wall there are two ... one of the impact the other one\nIs clearly a wall and there's dry wall hole there and it's probably about an inch and a half a wider point your parents height and maybe\nWe should warn but I don't know I even took a class\nAt a handy how on and on about Dr wallich here that I'm Wondering how they can work with Hank ... hats that racket there there's nothing behind the drywall I mean it's just open space\nAnd how big is so we have two holes that are that the brackets said hold the wallpaper or the toilet paper a holder on the wall or maybe\nLike a ... inch and a half long and maybe an inch high was is that a closed in their eyes ... hardly\nPay an inch and a half or so tall and not very wide ... about an inch wide of right\nAnd then there's two screws that go through that into the uh drywall\nI Believe so I looked at closely at the bracket but I'm Wondering if if the three haired and I don't know just here [noise] um [noise] it's something needs to be done other than just the packing material put on there and you're probably going to any\nMore than that you're probably going to need a little bit more than that let me ask you a question the whole where that bracket that whole bracket the one bracket is no longer attached to the dry wall so there's a whole they're\nCorrect right and how big is that whole\nWell it's probably not more than an inch an inch and a half at the higher and higher wise about\nIt's very good it's not all the same height and that is about three inches wide or sell\nOkay so that's going to be a challenge to patch it and then to come back in a put a bracket on it so that's what I was afraid I yeah so there's a couple of things we could do I'm One\nOf those things you might do is get an expression plate and the ... plate is something that may be ... just imagine a block\nOf wood that would cover that both of those brackets okay\nAnd they sell those decorative once okay oh\nAnd we would take that other bracket out right and we would basically install this ... this backer\nPiece okay so that would be there that would be visible that would go on and on the surface it would be decorative you can go up to the hardware store and you'll see 'em they Darren Woods\nSome memories sustain you could paint 'em and it's just a an ornate a backers backer piece\nThat goes over both holes that would get screwed and then you could screws a tour of the brackets on to that piece of wood in reinstalled your toilet holder\nYour toilet paper home okay I'd take a look at that\nThere's also plates that you can you know install over the whole uh but that's going to be a little bit challenging to than mount something on there I really take a look at some of your options on an excursion\nBehind a toilet paper over there and walk through the ... by all the different
