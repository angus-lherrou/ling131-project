[laughter] yeah it's not going to they're no they're not a powerhouse by any means you're dealing with a\nA really low horsepower engine that things have changed so much now I mean we're talking about even some of the really weak vehicles or you know for a hundred horse\nPower in in some of these bigger things now where we were lucky to get a hundred and fifty to yes hundred and Seventy five out of some of these old big engines you know they just did that\nI've driven a lot of older Chevy Truck and they just had a lot more you know horse power get up and go to this thing does\nWell and part of that could be because it's old and warn it's just you know I I Know I\nGot really of value on well wow\nYeah and then it'll be old and warn of I've seen have you on a fire truck that Scott thirty thousand miles on it yet either\nThey're shot a you know a lot of that has to do with idle time a lot of it has to do with just the components that they made these things out of and their ability to the not wear out in the fluids that were available at the time\nA new like you see all all the time no cars now we say oh two hundred thousand miles it's runs great so good good car well the same car made with thirty or forty thousand miles that was Thirty years old the\nThe things you're going to want to do those still just like any other gasoline combustion engine is\nIf it's if you if you just acquired it you know make sure do a cylinder test to see what kind of healthy you have a just a simple compression early down tested each cylinder easy to get at the spark plugs for the most part and you can check just to make sure you got healthy cylinders\nAnd at that point they should timing is that correct or make sure that the U.S distributor and is in good shape\nYou know just some of the the carburetor uh you can't always do much with those if they're operating correctly find out if it's open to all the the uh you know all the correct to butterflies and everything it it just makes it chokes not stuck\nOr just stuff like that that can make them extra doggy but they they weren't awesome to begin with\nKnowing a lot of those the timing is off but they they had so little contribution per se owned her to make up all eight that um\nSometimes if you disable one cylinder you really didn't hear a huge difference in the engine but if you've got that one ... it's going to be noticeable while you're trying to drive it but it may still run pretty good at idol\nIs it a straight stick yes so does it seem like it ... if you're in your polling gears of the better ratio does it is it the same way if you're like in first gear second gear\nIt it's got a little more slapped them and then you get up to the higher a speed but\nThat's you know what I got to talk about the scout again because I just can't stop myself wanting the scout in a in a local small town drawing for the American legion as a fundraiser and it was somebody had donated it was just to use a\nLittle bit rusty scout and I'm like oh this is kinda cool what year was it I Want to see it was the Seventy four or five\nI'm going to look it up and we'd like orange knows white it was hard to top it was it was I Believe will not had a thrill for ... or something like that and they yeah and it was definitely an eight and for whatever reason into will drive that thing could spin the tires\nMy ... one of my best friends in my cousin tied he snapped the drive shafted it finally we we got a little too aggressive with it but that made a a number of runs up the split rock river\nWhen it was frozen in the wintertime [laughter] up into the trees I could talk about it now but [laughter] it was up I was the wrong person to wait a minute about my life [laughter]\nIt was free right pill [laughter] I bought a raffle ticket right or what it was you know their bottom of the split road I Know we we\nWe sold it to somebody who was still serviceable well thanks for calling we appreciate it Don\nDon thanks very much for the call good luck let's talk to Nathan Nathan you're on the under the hood show what can we do for you\nKnow why I I got a two thousand five Subaru Legacy\nAnd and we've got problems with the rear suspension the at the back of the car said almost looks like it's been lowered and we can't seem to figure it out on what needs to be replaced or what's going on um\nAll the the whole batch shocks springs all that had been replaced and the funny thing I think it's gotten a little worse\nSome kind of looking for ideas I mean I've even found on line where a couple of different places are shows actually selling psyche butts basis for ... so I don't know if this was a common problem if that's the solution or not\nWe're all those springs instructs replaced with brand new parts\nYes yeah and it rears I actually replace the whole gist I ordered the whole um shock and spring altogether I didn't want to mess with a person and the springs down\nAnd when you and I didn't even I you know it was it good as soon as you did that for a short period or is it still exactly the same\nI remember it being a little better but it never really fixed the issue\nIs it the same problem with the the grand prix using that Ninety seven to old\nLever a full ready strode on there with everything on it correct\nYep exactly yup just held it right on some of them were just lower like with the grand prix and that or they just they set\nA little lower when they were brand new they were good for ten thousand miles than they settled and that's where they stayed and they were lower and if you don't like the way they did they do have some time space available when you put those spaces in it sometimes you need a layman sometimes you don't depending on\nWhat is a modified in that suspension on a car but they they do ride the all the ones I can picture in my head right now that our customers have most of them ride pretty low but\nI just I just pulled it up on Google Images all the images looked like the Atkins rides ... like they all look like they're saying look at it to a little bit yeah\nI guess I'm not I'm trying to understand if he's described as something where he is or if he had some of those ah you know those things people hang on the bumper if they'd be dragging underground or if you know how low it is in your nicknamed the Kurdish part well there but the\nHitch on that there's a hitch on there and it drags out it drags you know\nEasy if you had had skipped that's now all the way that he just [laughter]\nYeah there isn't a bunch of weight and back or anything but it just looks like it's sitting lower than it should like something's wrong with the ... suspension\nWell just trying to think of the way the cars you know the ballast in the car if there's anything that could be on the front the ... just trying to think through the ... geometry of the car if there's anything we're missing here or anti sway bars are are going to stop typically left and right when you're keeping the car flat when you're going to a quarter that really shouldn't have anything to do with it\nUm you know as far as the suspension into back though some of the cars not this one they'd have like a ... a transfer Springer cross there that would sometimes ... people would like in the grand breezy early ones that was a common problem but\nNot in this kind of a car it's it's kind of an independent suspension with that stretch there's only so many single that there is there's only so many things back there I Would say that if you're any\nIs there any downside to putting those Pacers enemies or anything that's going to\nKnow why it or it could harm something\nYou want to get it aligned you you want a good qualities but he's with the break on you and then you want to get it aligns when you change the height of a car the right eye you're going to change the climate so it's got to be it's got to be aligned after that's been adjusted\nThe even the ... like Chevy Trucks a lot of people but they they said crooked so in the dodge do they want to ... have leveling kits available for them to to bring you end up you want to make sure those things wind good\nYeah we did that to my sons pick up we put the level or get on the front spring blocks to the back just to bring the right height up a little bit and we brought it down headed range headed so aligned after that just to give me back into true and that was the recommended operating procedure\nNathan thanks very much for the call good luck that'll do it for another hour of the under the hood show until next time you can
