Colorado Army National guard here by the Colorado broadcasters association at\nThis station hello and welcome to another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress\nOr even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns of Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose\nAs the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned\nAbout the muscles that you don't feel that has the muscles in the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen health and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and active roses and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has\nTo do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many ... ... it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does build your teeth\nBut he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\nNobody will ... will up absorb it back from the bones if neither that's right I think\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of about\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of frozen nitrogen\nYup okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but\nFirst of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastor of the nation who they're irradiated um the calcium as much from the soils and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that in absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and a calcium supplements you know they buy at the health food\nStarted writer right but these things don't absorbing the body that's happening\nFor a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say at antacid that had the calcium in it like a ... first of all calcium does that absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it natural\nAnd the differences that isn't\nA powder and what happens if you put in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system wow so that's ... well\nYeah because when calcium and museum or a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than any other state well\nThat's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula or incredibly\nInto by the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right at the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after the ... the pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time in years I mean this is really amazing\nI Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium in
