and going through it and then looking for missteps or whatever um that's one thing is certain you want to do um but in terms of\nUm you know doing the walk through the probably the biggest thing is knowing that they're going to stand behind at home in just checking stuff in keeping the list I mean I'm I'm On the board of habitat for humanity ... a lot of houses\nAnd we trained or homeowners\nUm to really keep that list and eat the day the inspection to get some blue painters tape in in you know put the tape where the problem is because they're gonna be problems I mean you're going to him now pops and things like that a full day you know outside of that I'm\nQualified home inspector looking over the whole project that's not a bad idea um or and then secondary would be you just kind of walking through everything and\nSeeing you know I don't really have a checklist\nOkay so maybe maybe that you did have some kind of English yeah\nUnderwear and get a qualified inspector right here are kind of a rural area\nRight right that I see that I see um so do you have the architectural drawings of then\nI I yes I have to find that they they gave me with the\nEr so one of the things you can do is just check that the things you agreed to having that house are there okay\nOkay so you know the switches or where they are the floors type of quality it is I'm not going to say that you're really going to find any real imperfections I mean you you can take this as far as you want you can get a thermal imaging camera and make sure the inflation is all the way\nFrom top to bottom on the walls you can make sure the insulation says the 'cause they said in the ceiling\nUm\nThose type of things\nBut I guess my main concern is making sure that everything is tied together properly what these two sections were were\nOkay you lost me there [laughter]\nWell they came and it came into section see and they had to\nPut together uh-huh\nAnd and so I just want to make sure that everything is is satisfactory where the where the uh she joined sir\nYeah gee I don't even know if I could inspect that I'd I'd I wouldn't even know what to look at OK modular one day I don't know and I'm Sorry\nAll right Doug thing secular ... by by All right and I'm Michael you've got some uh some water softer tips\nBy being in the industry okay and what one thing I Know that there are some generic soccer is out there that you can get from a\nPay the ... you have a reputable farmer and they usually get from a company called black or Frank's okay older ... pretty generic ah water soccer I usually run in that six hundred dollar range installed they might be up a little bit depending on your area\nBut a colleague and an echo water or the two companies that basically invented\nWaters off your uh-huh and I have idea was to bring out the recharge tank and replace it when it was no longer making sock water and that's why the original commercial hey collagen man because you'd be out and he'd have to come exchange the tank uh-huh\nAtlanta land the uh in fact the first\nAutomatic water shopping or that you put salt in on your own and didn't have to have the exchange tank thing okay and let's see I was actually bought out by the echo water company ... man that was a privately held company but at any rate uh\nThey created the water soccer that uses the algorithm so it only uses the water or recharging when needed so it might only recharge happened back a quarter of a tank okay or pay this and that saves ball water\nAnd salt and it ruins charges for bottom up so ... that we're all the other brands unless the pat and does run out every re down at ... at all it\nWas the same direction grading rivers are ... and the bad and\nThen they lose their softening capacity over time\nYeah yeah I'd go water it may in\nFares Martin salt savers and you get 'em in the big box stores or you can of course by from one of the dealers and they range anywhere from three hundred bucks at the big box stores all the way up to two thousand\nDollars if you're getting are just the unit if you get an R O U attack another grandad or you can go to the big box store and get one that's made by them corn ... uh and beyond that under two hundred dollar\nAsher I'd I'd tell you I like I said I've had three water saw fairs and there is definitely different qualities out there\nUm I mean for sure uh the
