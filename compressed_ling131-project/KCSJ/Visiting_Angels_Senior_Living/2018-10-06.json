off\nYou shouldn't have done what you did or or vice versa you know I think with the desire that they are with the the change in the FCC law here a couple of years ago where the vehicle to vehicle communication ... was enabled and that is being designed probably as we speak\nThat the vehicle that you're about to run into could be controlled also by your decision which yeah scary ... where it could say I say scary but I'm going to move over oh there is a car they're the only way to avoid infections to slow the other car down so at that point then you've got this\nSlight track of cars that are all being controlled right independently but yet but yet as a group I mind yes exactly exactly [laughter] well done the so\nCould you have a virtual assistant in the car that would be talking to you I think it's totally logical to say that was a close when Chris [laughter] next time consider looking over your left shoulder\nShannon you stopped a little bit close to that car in front of you [laughter] yeah and I said things some shared and also not only that but the ... uh and I noticed that the driver of the other car did notice they looked at the mirror you could they some of those systems read where your eyes are ... and it would be\nYou've seem to have learned the drivers around you and your identity is above it causes a problem for our foreign people around you whose blood pressure have all gone out of it [laughter] you've raised them beyond the average woman is that is totally possible it is totally pause oh that is\nYou have a shared the person getting out of the car is holding a strange device\nBut the next step of that is\nShannon there's a McDonald's on your right hand side I notice that your blood pressure is a little low you probably need something to eat you might want to stop at McDonald's sponsored by [laughter] gee if I miss all that stuff All right I brought some new what are you got\nA new start up I think this is all of these ideas that we are talking about good or bad uh this one I think is the worst idea ever\nYour automotive but you're about to talk about what would it exists so a new start up as developed a way to get lazy people to work up a sweat by driving\nI'm intrigued the fit ... ... it's a pedal powered vehicle that's what the ... is based on an Audi a four von ... powered by the regular two point oh leader four cylinder gas engine but control of its acceleration and breaking\nIs due to bicycle pedals\nThe PC and be like a horrible idea trouble idea the ... remove the accelerator pedal and in its place as a pair of bicycle pedals hooked up to uh fly will the accelerators control and that actually exist they've gotten there done that they've done it the accelerator is controlled by an active peddling motion rather than depressing the peddling a conventional vehicle\nThey must have modified the foot ... well too right they had to deal with this set of generates an electronic pulse to engage accelerator they've also remove the break and replace it with a hand brake located on the steering column\nConcept allows you know you can imagine what there's three modes drive fast for highway speed so it's like a tense Pete Dr slow for slow moving traffic and no drive for bumper to bumper traffic drivers can also opt in for a harder work out be a rotary dial that controls the pedal resistance that's the worst idea of member\nWhy did you not see that car that you just hit I was busy paddling and I was getting tired\n[noise] it's just a\nStanding out that my car will be on the side of the road with his hands on his knees was that a legitimate story and absolutely one yeah yeah it was and they're doing it in remember where they they have a car on the road of course but yeah it wasn't in America\nBut can you think of a worse idea than that\nNo [laughter] really it's right up there eight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call that came into the hotline\nHello my name is ... we have a two thousand seven Nissan just about eighty seven thousand miles on the road for so under a lot of the stunts like squeaking perhaps onto the good took it and get it checked does it really need the ... changed you can only has a dissidents\nOf miles on it we should be holding off on that in order to just minor it's not it's a very hard to hear what it's like he he\nWrote a great question money to take a swing at this one sure I can have your feelings Pepe a yeah change it\nThat it it eighty seven thousand miles is I Would say a hundred ... this this I'm winging this I'm making a hundred thousand it's probably about the the uh interval on that and said that squeaking it's telling you maybe there's an issue I Would go ahead and changing ... nothing bad will happen I'm worried about\nThe eleven years yeah there you go it's the time and the elements of eleven years is a it's a long time most recommendations are going to be half of that to replace the main excess rebuilt and a lot of these vehicles\nNow having said that I've had numerous ones that I've taken past the five to say I really wouldn't do that but but if you're started if it's starting to talk to you and they believe it's coming from the belt\nYou want to look at the belt and there are some of the ... and things like that that they make\nIf you look into it in the parts catalog and they have a common sold part it's a ... for that vehicle that can sometimes be an indication that get the kitten replace all the push replaced the rollers and everything like that but if it's just a tiny ...\nWould start with the low hanging fruit put the belt on it while the belt is off have 'em just inspect all the I ... and different things to make sure nothing is exceptionally loose and you should be just fine so I'm more concerned about the fact that it's got eleven years on it almost twelve than I Am about eighty seven thousand miles\nIf he called and said the exact same thing it was this vehicle and it had it worked fine ran find he wants to buy it and it has never had the serpentine built change you would say\n... change about you know I I've definitely changed belt and so that things that people forget\nQuite a bit is that it's not always the miles at the time in in the time that something's been in service has to do with the elements if if yes that had been in a climate controlled storage and never been out in the elements you get\nAdvantage of making that stuff last longer but the the rubbers and the and the tires or the belts the hoses all these different things they do degrade
