that's the way they like it now let's go under the hood with a nordstroms motor medics welcome back to the end of the show we're glad to have you with us eight six six five nine for for one\nFive oh if you are where a police officer and you came upon a car that was wrapped around a tree you'd be very nervous yes this story does have a good ending okay but uh in may recently\nThe police in Nevada phone eight totaled out McLaren seven twenty s near lake meat\nAnd that would make me nervous did I Would a room it was going to a hundred miles is the seven\nHundred and ten horse power twin turbo charged V. eight car that weighs less than thirty two hundred pounds so we're talking about a a car they can get some sort of sixty in less than three ... quick very quick\nWell they ran across this car and they looked up the car and they say the car was purchased just before the friday before it's a a dealership in washing your were Washington DC\nOh and they found it the next day in the great falls area\nSo there are kind of concerned\nAnd so the police department they go out and they put out a message on Twitter saying buying a high performance car which costs about three hundred thousand dollars was total and winding road by on friday total on Saturday the moral of the story that was was printed here or in the final assembly and a lot of automotive news was that\nEven a a hyper super car that has the best suspension and the best breaks and the best of everything for driving fast\nThrough a winding road with a properly trained driver right that respects the car\nCan lead to ... near deadly circumstances and if I should do this picture the driver was minor league injured oh my but that's what they ran across I Can't show our listeners that pitcher but I can show Russian Christ that picture out ... you would you would expect to come upon that vehicle and find\nRight someone not with us any All right and I know from experience that if you get a car that you think you'd understand and do something you aren't trained to do it can go bad in a hurry I've had that happened in my life for a couple of different time usually cars\nThat stick really hard and performed really well around those corner when they break loose when they break loose hang on much worse than regular\nCars sold on this is just a good reminder slow down it could cost the especially if you're driving your new McLaren ... seven twenty s not a good not a good thing not a good thing at all\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call that came in after hours\nGuys out here in the back door got a two thousand viewing this or the or does it work\nFor the warm air into the ... not ... the cross troubles warm there\nOnce the engine gets up to operating conditioned about a hundred and eighty three hundred and eighty five degrees no matter where he just said it starts cooling any ideas on that is\nSo it's fine warming up so it has heat when until warms up yeah\nThe bad thing about that is a lot of cars that have head gasket issues that start blowing exhaust gases into the cooling system when that ... gets fully warmed up and in ...\nThe thing the cooling flow\nTo act like that as they start up and they're starting to warm up oh great cold air warm air warmer hot air now the temp uses up now it's colder and it'll switch back and forth as you drive down the road and accelerate the celery\nThat's one of the that's a possibility the only other thing you could be is the complete failure of one of the fresh air vents are where it would be ducking right past the heater core fresh outside their\nRight or electronic temp sensor in the car that once it warms up says ... and it changes I mean those are a couple of things\nWe would be leaning towards doing a head gasket check on a vehicle like that to see if it with a with a gas tester now do you do that well you know it's a pretty simple ... are kept comes off when you but there's no pressure do don't blow it off this has something to shop needs to do\nWhat they would remove the cap they would use the or the or a full bottle whatever your applause draws gases from the radiator just a or know who went through this two filled with liquid a couple of separate compartments and as it goes through\nIf there's hydrocarbons which was anything that's in your\nTailpipe coming out in that cool which there should be none of it indicates there's a crack in a block or head or a head gasket leak immediately turns colors from usually from blue to yellow and you you\nGot a problem but if that doesn't occur there is a good indication that it's something else but that's a quick cheap test to find out what's going on\nOur head gasket better these days or has my life changed as I've become an adult\n[noise] yeah and well here's part of it though they've started going to similar mated metals between the head the block okay a lot of her head gasket problems came in when we had aluminum cylinders had sitting on top of a cast iron block\nAnd so you had different properties of cheating different properties of the of of the ability to to flex under heat and marrying the too doesn't always work great\nSo when I was in high school a ten year old car was a Nineteen eighty car so they were more likely to be\nWell and and even before that you had cast iron on top of caster ... which wasn't as much of a problem but when they started getting in the middle ground there to live with them on top of castor that's what we started seeing more oh yeah more more problems with head gasket in into the gas gets now as we've advanced\nWe have got aluminum blocks aluminum heads and also you are in some situations not pushing 'em the pressure or through the system that you were on the other ones but I I think the bigger issue would probably be the fact that the coolest properties have gotten better\nUh I think people are more\nIn tune with cooler maintenance than they probably were ten years ago\nI think the court maintenance used to be looked upon in a similar fashion as break\nFluids maintenance maintenance is today replace it when there's a leap exactly yeah and they didn't realize the ability for that cool it to build up ... properties and metallic properties just based on its use through the vehicle\nAnd and those are the things over time if it's not replaced in that\nThe coolest gets whether it be too acidic or to have you in one property other\nIt'll start chip away at the gas gets and eventually cause the puzzle leak and so I think that the combination of some of those things have changed that so we don't see those those normal offenders like we usually would still see a lot of it out there\nThanks for joining us on the under the hood show until next time you can
