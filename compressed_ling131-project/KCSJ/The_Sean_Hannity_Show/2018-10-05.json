I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge whether Trump voters a short you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing\nLast Thursday a those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked at ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at the map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours\nEntering states that that Donald Trump won\nWhat can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay on because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man and his family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was a poll that we did for super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day\nIt's it's not a big explosion but what it is is ... ... is coming back in\nAnd get along well ... ... that Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nShot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but al ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is an ongoing leaving the house which right there you can lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races they're all very very close within the margin of her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than\nYou are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with my writing of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think it's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going on inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where we\nDon't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did to this man for support\nAnd disgusting and I don't believe who live poor experimenting Arlen than things\nThat you know what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness\nThe topic deserved they handled it properly they looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration\nNow do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nIt's too early on the house and and prior to cabinet looked like we're going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy\nFor her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take her on every day about them wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders I've been having a back to the elites where the swap around the country again\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick ups energy\nAll right thank you both John McLaughlin and dug shown eight hundred number one Sean toll free telephone number will continue
