Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there are outraged by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American\nHeritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals proof of Native American ancestry again what proof\nAt this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah no no you turn to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group born by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I think keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project ... tape with Claire McCaskill in our own words also but now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were\nObtained a copy of it and Democrats in strategist to prepare the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible when you're Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now you want with Kavanaugh as well even that CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what\nHis platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but again a ... and\nThat's what I'm going\nTo win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nOne poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for dean huh\nAt least no one can independently find anybody that was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the four people that's Julie sweating except we're at those parties one's dead to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't do virtually sweating it was so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story but also the hunting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe country over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the
