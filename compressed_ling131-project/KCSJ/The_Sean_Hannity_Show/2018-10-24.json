been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nUm how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the holes you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces bidding and Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\n... they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the seat where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and in other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist\nOh does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies oh the the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt\nDon't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nYou know it ought not be prices precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nSo we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz was officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office you\nKnow with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder tech them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences\nOf security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax\nThat was sent I don't get packages anymore and my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that was it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's dawn wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you\nKnow that was sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder's another one and\nYou know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's\nDefense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin in ... the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such heroism\nIt was amazing but you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the buildup to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skull leases shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame burning I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I eat can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters you're not responsible for that but the media today and their their reaction to\nThis is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting Lee partisan it just it they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox\nWe had rice and sent to Trump mad as re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I'd been consistent and I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today from liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence\nIn the last month over the most serious

that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt though Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMaybe even watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very

like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three reticent a phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nA showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states the elected what's\nSo amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same user and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but she's going to be selling liberal once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again\nSo because this what Jesse over and says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that our party has pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that if we do it very costly confirms suspicions and we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and nearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to move the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOnce but if you're not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn Web day so\nIt's so hateful showing that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody and his staff but McCaskill asked to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's in harm's way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but\nThirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something all Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nWill spare no resources are expense in this effort and I just wanted to tell you
