Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yelled classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug gr and rapists the teenage girls so give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from your Danielle and don't duck and don't dodge and don't have in the hall that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not ... I and I'm not the one who was investigating this right and we talked about this last week wait a minute but in talking hunted\nWith a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I Know and if I had to\nUse I mean every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of Mr Vermeer is the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed\nHimself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift and backtrack\nFrom her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not trying to get ... and I did\nI mean all you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they\nDon't recall those stories at all that it or that happen that way at all\nSo the judges are college roommate and staying on at the last twenty four hours a day looking about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for ... um the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there's specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do short timeline get something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but I also believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair investigation and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge ... and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know as a talking point what was on a second once you interview look in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one I witnessed says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else did the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did as reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... the FBI just\nJust not that was can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not\nOnly do you now you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bouncing ball all of the ...\nIf there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got she got home we don't even know the house but you mentioned four people were there for people under penalty of fellow they all said that didn't happen the way she said one witness or didn't happen\nAnd my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for anything quick break we'll come back more with

toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program All right so this vote Friday Saturday big votes big opportunity\nAnd we have Susan Collins and senator snowflakes saying that they are satisfied that the comprehensive investigation of the FBI Lisa Murkowski saying the hasn't had time to read it\nDemocrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI what were they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we say Hi first Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up and spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds sounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a\nGood people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had an absolutely not um and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know they look at him and you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually related I think it for three\nOr four generations back our great great something grandfather he was actually the founder of snow flake of Arizona which I thought you would really love\nThe you know his [laughter] somebody told me that yesterday on my record with really no there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like um I Hope it goes the right thing\nIf any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would that not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here\nAnd all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh were to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating but the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a media hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that that come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city":
