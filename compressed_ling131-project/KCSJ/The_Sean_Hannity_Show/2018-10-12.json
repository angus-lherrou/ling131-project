James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency but the very purpose of getting elected\nAnd they say it not once but they say it over and over and over and over again I don't play view later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing\nThat people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh wait do we get to the tape on sentiment today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but go when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to give one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs are just post chops and never come back well in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nWhen they tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that has created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just will humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ... marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently she'd running a horrible economic difficulties with like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nHow do I spend Twenty one twenty two years in jail and an opportunity to interview or I absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the hours Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons but whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human\nOur human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a\nRice it's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people\nTo do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs\nIn America you know the ... they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative\nAnd it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness it's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat folks aren't that since you train Kanye West and the racial draft now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of it of the Trump administration's\nMiss was an embarrassment Conyers mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there a man who is clearly not OK and a president who's willing to accept boy that\nWas a combination of stream of consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a

pulling out of the phone and France like Titanic as colorfully outside I think for their own calling up somewhere picture of a ... I mean\nJust to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television make at that but I think overall I\nUh I saw the play by play and political and now as you're not thinking is that with her fault on our life\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually full bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\nThis was white supremacy by ring true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiled\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices and yet of black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been ... by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable ... anybody this I don't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nHe is a pack on that vicious horrible level I don't even know what to say my friend Heisman Trophy\nWinning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and the questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to them is quote the oh leave all want to repeat what you just heard\nBecause there's a lot at stake that's not going to be the end of the world of the Democrats were just going to make everything harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress\nI that that's really the truth and it's important that we keep the momentum are you're better off than you or two years ago are you a safer more secure is the economy better off on every measure we know the answer to it\nBut watching Democrats on hands is pretty amazing right we got tapes on yes read as soon as running in ah Tennessee and cinema in Arizona will play those next [noise]\n[noise]\nNBC News radio I'm Tom Robertson and American pastor will soon be heading home after being released by Turkish court NBC correspondent Kelly O'Donnell\nThis is the story of Andrew Brunson who's been detained in Turkey for two years he was swept up after a coup attempt a on a president or two on there and was accused of terror related charges\nBrunson denies those charges and the Trump Administration says they're false President Trump announced pastor Brunson released in all caps tweet this morning\nTurkish officials reportedly have graphic audio and videotape showing the murder of a journalist inside of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul the Washington Post says turkey alerted U.S officials about the tape revealing the brutal interrogation and torture and killing of columnist ...

sixteen Donald Trump all over redux\nA we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shown is with us welcome both the back to the program thank you thank you thank you\nI don't think there's any doubt the cabinet overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence\nHas now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and send them a in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies and when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nQuality that I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done our regulations to visit with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing in how unfair it was and you can see we had to pull this this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the ... the energy sector is so important to the state\nThat you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want chops and what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is do you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down and you weren't philosophy to raise taxes take what you got and take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where you know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker and they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country does\nShown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house\nBut I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it and they want to get rid of ice they won't fund a border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who\nThought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing state even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat problem it's not me and it stems cells are streaming shows or write to\nMe it was it that are closer to the extreme conservative no place in the state of scenarios that it's not because it's\nSimple no one has tons within a rifle no one can\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything and you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity and New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nSee a Johnny Williams will you disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of the state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no\nNo income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg ... I heard it oh yeah yes\nI don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him 'cause he's moving so far left\n... it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as John says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got it's\nHe could run out whether\nOr not you know like you're ... you're not the way by the way we're checking out your high school yearbook\nRight now I have never looked at it I Know for a good idea what's in there and my God\nI Know what you're not exactly run up to the Supreme Court but if if you check out\nLike that but I looked at the half of my junior my junior senior year I was tending bar till four thirty in the morning a lotta night than\nYou know I was just I didn't show up half the time so that's probably a good thing people don't even recognize that I went there with lots of witnesses yeah I'm sure there as well we'll dig 'em up somewhere from forty years ago uh All right John McLaughlin and a dog show and thank you both for being with us [noise]\n\n\nNBC News radio I'm Tom Robertson hurricane Michael's devastation is now being linked to at least Thirteen debts and that number is expected to arrive today we learn to for victims being killed in storm related incidents in Gadsden County Florida Florida governor Rick Scott said this at the scene of Wednesday's landfall Mexico beach on Florida's panhandle\nWe had more storm surge probably hear the norm\nWe can probably twice as much rain but this was\nMore than a million people remain without power due to the one time category for hurricane and the swap from Florida to Virginia there's apparently proof that Washington Post columnist Jamal could show was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey NBC cheap foreign correspondent Richard Engel\nWashington Post says that the Turkish government that the Turkish security agencies have\nRecordings audio and video recordings showing that your mouth and she'll be this\nJournalist who's been missing for over we walked into this building never seen lean to to leave and the recording that once he was in thought he was murdered interrogated and\nMissouri State University students says she was raped in her dorm room just hours after attending a meat to rally the twenty two year old victim at her alleged attacker met Saturday after attending the rally\nA white Michigan man who shot out of black teens who had knocked on his door to ask for directions is guilty of assault within tend to do great bodily harm Jeffrey Ziegler fired at fourteen year old Brennan Walker this past April during closing arguments today the prosecutor told the jury the evidence backs up the charges\nWere killed\n... whole thing that George ...
