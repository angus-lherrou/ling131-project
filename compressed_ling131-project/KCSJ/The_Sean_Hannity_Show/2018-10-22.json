S. dot com and\nI'm [noise]\n\nLooking back at it as a ... show so nice to have you with us this afternoon and are the saving depending on where you are around the country\n\nThe politics of the political caravan Democrats clearly want to use this caravan of illegal immigrants coming to the U.S now and almost ten thousand stronger\nGet here close as they possibly can to election day have America or have to stand up for itself and then they'll use it against the president saying this is the Republican Party this is how inhumane they are they're going to support the children they are going to support the mothers they're going to exploit anybody they possibly can export\nThey're going to do what ever they can to support them so they can use their hardships for their own political reasons\nLet's go to your phone calls on this see what you think about it one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to uh let me go to George thinks are wedding you're on the bench Ferguson show go ahead\n[noise] yes first thing I like to say is that President Trump is doing the right thing\nI Am the place and that came over in the Nineteen fifties from New York and they should stop all of this immigration nonsense and go back to the a plan they had in the fifties you had to have a sponsor first of all\nAnd that sponsor usually gave you a job for you to when they will be on your own in the country and get another job this thing is\nIf something when Wallace you sponsor responsible for you in other words that was no such thing is going on welfare and that's one of the big problems here\nAnd what happens is if the sponsor didn't want to do anything you went back to the ... you came from and that's the way it should be\nSee I I agree with you because it used to be accountability there now it's well I don't want to have to deal with any of the accountability the government or the the Democratic Party has in essence become the sponsor\nThat's correct and and and so they say there is no there is no one to show you the ropes there's no one to get you connect to the community there is no one there to hold you accountable to work to your tail off\nThere's no one there for any of that because now it's just getting this country will give you a free health care will give your kids free schooling we'll give you everything you want for free\nYeah it's all political and it just basically getting bogus could've done with that that's the only thing they have left everything else\nIs a failure you look at any city the Democrats have a tip your sticks to eat it and you can follow that city bankruptcy\nPeople are moving out of those places and into places that have a better tax rules I mean this is a big big problem and if you used to avoid any regime that is correct word to use here\nOkay because they were in the past ... you know this goes back to Alaska gene uh they were advertising\nFull page ads in Hong cities to South America and they make cities and basically telling all the ... things that the United states had cause them to get it in the\nShallow any taxpayer out that she is this what they do they get the whole thing should be on the tax payers broaden that had jobs here and the distribution ... distribution of Monday she'll be up to the governments\nWho was who was your sponsor when you when you came through I mean it was in a family friend out of that work\nThis was the Catholic Church\nAnd they ended they do more than just sponsored a mentor you did they get you connect in the community what all did they do\nYeah they uh they did that and they provided a depression job and you had to work there for about a year to two years and then if you had something better going ah you know job why are you going to get that job\nIt was it's a simple system but it's the you know it's up to you you don't want to crush peoples and ... and that's when they come here and the only ambition that most of those people have is to go on welfare that's the only Sumpter yeah at me as a human being\nAnd as you just put it don't go on welfare don't have a backup plan amen to that great point and I appreciate the phone call will continue this conversation right now on Facebook and on Twitter ...

Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up\nAnd do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former friends and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take this it and I don't care if they're not going to\nUm ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it\nYou've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene in usa peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it there is that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the Pfizer warrants the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael with us Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom\nBetween the Congress has an important issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a two to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWas fat conversations George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and then the court intercepting those compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said this\nSame thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump\nCollusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath\nBut I still had to

citizens so that the men and women are now ... get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone in that are\nIn protest on the left and and the right in

about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren\nHas claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania all teach you got all the law school\nShe was described as quote the only in your minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her ...\nThey are and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against\nAs a result of all this then tries to prove to her detractors\nThat she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but\nYou know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld than Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nIn showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the un Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House in ... when you're twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever on\nIs a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nTake your kids to cover today\nGo to ensure kids now dot Gov or call one eight seven seven kids now [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nGo go\nReally shutting down a woman or online services something called ... plus [noise]\nAfter they found a software glitch that exposed private profile data of nearly half a million users to outside for developers this all happened last week Google\n\nThey ...

J. lo and I are radios\nAt ... dot com on your own with our high orange radio ads\nIn numbers how many ... that appears to be part of the strategy for a caravan of migrants that started in Central America now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they're willing to take their chances spite us efforts to stem the flow\nAnd then you've got a case an allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nApparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I\nThey should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you that\nIf you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida he'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe it's not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with uh we've got infinite whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run the center of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum is we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBeing honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett us it and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason bread I said is out there trying to convince the people tend to see that it's something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and\nSaying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets hoops to Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been\nCut the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the week in front of some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening LA Weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep you keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or hired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled\nAmericans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have ... I didn't get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber\nIt's a far cry from last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... alley is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ...

Marshall mixed Martha McSally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and a high camp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly a problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian race\nAnd that means that the libertarian is siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong\nWell Mike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh served citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal as we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats as at an all time high but you know I'm Crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on friday and an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people a hundred and thirty\nThe president of turkey says he's going into detail tomorrow in his speech before parliament about the details surrounding the death of Saudi journalist ...

border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally it is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the

legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming asylum aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nOr we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend and happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now hearing Kissinger was shouted down listen to some of this [laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries you know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... or what's the name Maxine Waters you you create a crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country\nYou know then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is as wrong as it gets this is not how not on a decent people are supposed to behave and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean is did is to send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am\nNow is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the ideas he'll show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left\nThis isn't new to this is the way liberal and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong and just\nNot going to let me ask you this and this great nation off or\nHow does the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing it has this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know we're getting we're we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that mixed in with the crowd to want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safest for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't want to see people the president does want to see that\nBut on the other hand I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nI write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats once a quarter because I think deep down they want the politics of this issue they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this catch and release policy hold them\nHow they're have their case that due to cater to we can find out or they legitimate or they're really fleeing something or or are they coming here to do harm are they part of the same game what's their background each it takes some time to do that but and it takes resources it takes\nPresident Trump tweeted the Democrats are to blame for the care of and for the lax immigration

living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors Asian the caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credential judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll tell you the CBs carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your border because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response so\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... what could the rancher possibly\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last ... Eighteen months that is a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better when in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and

wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is\nOr living
