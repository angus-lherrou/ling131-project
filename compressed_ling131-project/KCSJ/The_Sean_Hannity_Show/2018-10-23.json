provide some benefits the economy as a whole it also turns to the press further the wages of blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community who I've argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put them in the deportation until\nWe have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair it was suggested that I was thinking about

personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up uh I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know of anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different

sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight and a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight\nThis ... this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I Will have no choice and\nI think this this is I think one of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he I mean I talk to them at a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt\nHe feels this very deeply on the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning to hit me this morning the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices\nThen you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states they can deal with them in northern Mexico and if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border\nThey're stuck in northern Mexico well and I think our our position ought to be a that Mexico to decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they turn back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept the I'm In a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority to block elites\nProgram set in the

Boulder through the window I'm at you saw what they did to Henry Kissinger you saw what they did that Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing leak claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the success to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice collection but I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I look I think that's right um and I think that that is a sense\nUm the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become it's clear on the left you now have\nSort of a brown sugar Nineteen thirties to total

democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people are and drive them out of public life or you know no matter the Maxine Waters is not a trivial pursuit she would share\nFor the banking and financial services committee if they get control of the house so significant people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of\nLegitimacy of the modern of American government which left passionately believes uh I I think you're right that that's a factor the reason I picked Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment is\nThese are historical events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't chess politics\nIt was historic what are we gonna get a solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be mayor and carrots or assassinated and allied manipulated and browbeat and into backing oh that was that was a story moments in effect for the next forty or fifty years\nAre similarly this caravan whether uh seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers right and that's already up to fourteen thousand\nIf this camera there and can get into the United states\nHow big is the next caravan and the shower then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time

not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that's\nJust not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed look at you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter and and our other interaction\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nI look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on\nAnd pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigations and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nEconomic success fourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in\nIn fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the other the say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they\nPretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am elated so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message has been moving the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good for would do it with the conservative movement or they're going to vote with\nUs because just starting to see that this was a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics of CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey\nWhat's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the all the black vote than any other Republican president\nI'll throw this day but if if we all believe in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that have that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he needs to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we have an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the leftist\nAuthoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics\nChanging the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a rat race a sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut also they also hold eyes up to ... yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt\n[noise] why did we\nFind a woman and final thoughts here from pastor Darrell Scott also agreements with it what is you have a last name right Karim ... near near okay and David Limbaugh a David we'll give you thirty seconds by the last word thoughts today what's gonna happen and fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stay off the um the so called blue blue way that we might even retain the house\nAnd we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close that we don't want to keep it I think as the pastor Scott said earlier said well there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling ya liberals can't stand this\nKanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's I think we need to go on a positive message nationalizing these last do\nWe how how great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country has a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they could afford a vacation take the kids the does anyone there seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids\nGo out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal this this humanity\nYes it is I really believe these next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this isn't a weapon formed against the self prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even
