obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption\nOf innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country\nAnd I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nOr tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted his son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nOf covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations\nJust going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place\nShe mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind and no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and\nYou know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in you know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out Mr Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor\nI'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drug ... almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties\nBut as he said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up a story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week\nPrior how does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in Brett Kavanaugh I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some collaboration\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualify for someone who sent U.S Supreme court [noise]\nWe need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claim the Ford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment\n... look these are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day she said there were four people that could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story most don't remember\nAny party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault\nSaid it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent you don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement\nAnd assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nIf they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but by\nI mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I got to believe and assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee\nI'm just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clintons sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of

this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh there'll only do it I Believe it's impact is enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been\nA smeared and treated with a personal attack all those things I think means that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper\nUnderlying lesson that all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stays for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president for the first time in forty years you ran on something and you've got the entire\nCaucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi opium Minnesota he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president is set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back he didn't say we're back yet because we're not\nTo solve a lot of work to them but we're coming back and now we have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this will actually be about which kind of America do you want us to be\nYou want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs professional and promote ... are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radical I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable\nI Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans can defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course that is probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember it and you remember 'cause you were there to thousands sixteen two weeks out I Do interviews Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you're gonna lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I just said to her we have to alternative universes\nIn my universe I Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear it Democrats say they're for Medicare for all they are trying to destroy Medicare\nThey're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wage campaigning I must say President Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American\nHis disgusted by what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move\nA you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election\nI got to

I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney I didn't pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney the way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid\nAnd I would say they have handled this what the appropriate

their own political okay\nWell that's exactly right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think\nI don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah I mean [laughter]\nDon't real does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry

with so many inconsistencies in all cases no corroboration not the case of professor poured not the case of Mr Ramirez and not the case with Julie sweating it\nKnow co-op corroboration Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing welcome both have you back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody I mean that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's or the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers to help it you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chains do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts is there no to corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we\nHave now we examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and\nNow the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nYeah well I think um what has to happen\nWith Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied them like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to your maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist a resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats Deborah cats by the way who said well Paula\nJones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I ... I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are\nFor safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says occurred and if she had gone to those people\nWhat they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it\nShe had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know because we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think to the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now push this so far\nInto a ... ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably\nPeople react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that he believed everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is\nNon existent there is nothing happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them there's\nAnother problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys and it just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she does say\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean hey listen if you have sunspots

Maine Lisa Murkowski Alaska and senator snow flake of Arizona\nWho knows which way he's going to go and the Democratic side probably the only two we might be looking at our Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and those are very popular Trump states maybe Joe Donnelly of Indiana would reconsider but I doubt it I wouldn't expect it\nUm but I Hope you remember this and thirty four days\nI Hope you know I Hope you know that if Democrats win the house and Senate this is now a party that will smear slander the march be involved in character assassination character legitimacy to get power\nNo agenda to make the country better known that I've heard you know impeached Trump they want the crumbs back they want to raise taxes they won't open borders get rid of ice

All right let's get to our busy phones Christie is in Portland\nOut in Oregon liberal land out there what's up Christie how are you glad you called\n[laughter] and um I have just wondering something strapped with Dr ... when I first heard her testimony that will ... innocent voice that seem cannot match or professional standing\nI look I don't want a good into ... to me that the ... ... it's not even relevant to the issue that's my honest take here's what we do know that matters facts truth matters serious allegations\nIt's not about how it's presented it's whether or not it is credible and what we have is in the case of professor Ford no location how did she get to and from the where the alleged ... events took place\nMisconduct allegations et cetera et cetera um remember no corroborating evidence no location there is no forensic evidence there is no one the backs up or claim\nThe people that she identified at this at this house where this alleged incident happened nobody corroborate that\nThe one I witnessed she says in the room says it didn't happen that way at all period so ... you know let's just I'm just sticking to the facts and all of this I don't know anything about the people that have been coming forward I'm not in the business of going after\nPeople that are private citizens\nI Do see the the workings between Dianne Feinstein is an old leftist political radical pro\nHiring recommending the hiring of a resistor lawyer ... cats who said well Paula Jones has been ten to twelve minutes you know Bill Clinton that's not enough to constitute workplace\nHarassment of any kind\nUm he dropped his pants and said kiss it\nAh sorry that was in this day and age imagine Deborah cats as reaction if it was a Republican she's donated tens of
