of the American people more prosperous that will create more opportunity that will make us more secure\nEverything you get is predictable Democratic Party one oh one mere slander ... blood joining whoever they don't like and don't agree with it you know the new it is there one and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher\nFor weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago if the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt built today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall you know record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years\nLast time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes Hispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nResidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea\nThe sanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards\nTo that President has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's\nVast wilderness and we just let it sit there and we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they're going to now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know it was just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pit and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would follow the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that they went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and in in Iraq at Torrey and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling\nThe number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside and anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's studying in terms of what it reveals since it directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the price of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the D. OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes as she was on with Maria ... I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the price of warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the size of warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without a Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a ... an application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS or die ca on Trump\nTape Trump anyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously because he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nYou know Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving those thing [noise]\n\n[noise]\nNBC News radio until I'm Robert monstrous that's the word Florida governor Rick Scott is using to

Hannity show\nTwenty five 'til the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land that a category three a and there's a massive storm surge risk the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined\nFort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane\n... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast\nThis one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look to the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nAnd it's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and he said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to Tampa oh or whatever I can say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto we hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's heading\nIt's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas\nYou're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves up it's going to accelerate through there\nWhere we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nNow also locking down it's all good for the American people\nI don't know why people you know there are different people different styles and life like lenders very combative and drops the F bomb a lot\nOn this because not doesn't do it on the program because we have a dump

Rosenstein conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least to the spin was well I was just say that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah quarter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... cave and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAny way now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI remember then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special

insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's\nHow you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care bound Asian you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... with able to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are pushing me was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of liberty and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for service because they just are helping shots\nWondering ensuring if using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized and your co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so you know I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that you're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shocked\nTo gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody he whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household ah the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nSo you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you actually looking at ways that are fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a book you know as far as the cost of care is you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we we can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well above a care made that illegal\nOr so something ... just brought up to ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually crew insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses there's Seventy five dollars a month or\nTwo but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition or ... or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by them\nAnd how did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nHer imaging everything will hire people or ... thousand dollars low yeah so that's a Ninety thousand dollar saving\n... at a hundred thousand dollars a conversational she's going to die of cancer\nAt ten thousand dollar a couple of dollars that go to the church raise raise money in a big sale\nOh and you know considering that most people are out of pocket expenses now for health insurance plans to let them thousand dollars per year what do we ensuring when the once in a lifetime catastrophic won't can be treated mature for less than ten dollars bingo\nUnbelievable well look I Hope everybody will pay attention because in twenty eight days Americans are going to go to the polls in Obamacare won't work and we know the left and the Democrats want to keep it in\nA I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate the model around the country speaks volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving people's lives and it's very inspiring thank
