talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for it had been a blast of the president's\nI just think it's bizarre I think it's way over the top I think\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nThough I ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this had been a tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers\nResult reason to believe some of

only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I and phone into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I had been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good bowl with the right thing to do um but with that and I'm now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir a congratulations this seems to be a very big comeback\nI'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell ... thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter flop advance the Trump jobs agenda\nAnd matches or dishonest Washington liberal more and more people drill down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very do it and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worries during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nYou know it's one of our our best resources that we have clean coal and we have you know people brave enough to go in the mines I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's about energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened and Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years during the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the offer ... took the lead nationally to go against you know I'm a power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal\nOn the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are basically your health services rage that President Trump's\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate that so that's one of the president's comments were strongly behind me she knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today are meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nAnd I have a compassionate solution\nTo ensure the safety of Democrats the best thing you can do is to simply vote them out of office so they won't be in a position that anger is so many people and remove them from daily public political circumstance in threat once again I condemn all bombs in politics today well known Democrats or the ...\nWe must protect them vote them out of office for their own good and their own safety that

glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of take the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal or replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf if we in two weeks to have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold onto the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have by the way preexisting conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about\nBeen able to get Dr Josh ... outlets Seventy in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals or even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals\nAnd if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a vacation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nBut we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada\nUh we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Christ in ... now no problems with Americans joining\nGee how to use and and joining the Taliban then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly his case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three\nBob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night second big surprises a night is Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know the state uh most worried about to be very honest as Florida\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if elected governor is going to ruin this great state [noise]\nAnd you see all the prosperity and all the money that has been flowing into Florida\nStart dissipating almost immediately and you're going

reaction\nI looked at it and I said well let's say really saying and this is typical liberal they try to hide and then somebody figures out exactly what it is that they are saying so there you go now we know\nThat we made a decision about a Supreme Court judge justice for political reasons that was hit\nTo Gail I'm looking I'm surveying the country right now this is how I see the Democratic party they\nThey only want to talk about Russia collusion if it's Donald Trump they don't care at all the Hillary we now know bought and paid for Russian wise to disseminate to the American people before the election that those lives for the the bulk of information to secure\nPfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate they lied and committed fraud before the court and then they used it to set up a special counsel by leaking that information they're leak media league strategy but does that apparently was their\nTheir insurance policy when people like Peter Struck a saying that Hillary should win a hundred million is zero\nAnd I'm Wondering why don't they care about Hillary's Russian allies why do they not care about Keith Ellison ...\nYou know charges against him nobody is asking for FBI investigation into him and in that case we have tape syntax and doctors' reports or the recent charges against Spartacus a Cory Booker\nUm and it's the same on every other issue you know the all the you know we have all these Democrats talking violently about the president Republicans on these mobs and most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right but they always go at things which a double standard and it doesn't matter what the issue is whether it's something legislative slaves that were working on or something that is political and Sean what they want to do is say look\nOur our our ... our ends justifies the means that we're using to go about this to get to family want to go\nAnd that is not the way Tennessee I'm ...

I Love music city and I love the people of Nashville and I've got to imagine they were pretty insulted\nA and a little bit shocked that somebody would be that duplicitous behind the scenes and then when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff\nAre I'm sure that he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course you know and then they start saying\nWell it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project their task project\nThey started saying well all these other excuses but the ... they got caught they got caught saying we made this decision because we want to go to people about where he is don't worry he got to be a good kept crap when he gets there\nThey've got to say this that and the other in order to get him there and it's\nLike as a parent I mean when your kids do something wrong my kids do something wrong which rarely happens are kidding but you know what it's not I'm I'm never is mad at what they did but if they try to lie to me about it then they're in big trouble not a little trouble I don't care what it is I can deal with the mistake\nI Can't deal with you lying to me in looking in my eyes and just outright lying to me and my line to my kids is you know I I Am not stupid stop treating me like I Am stupid\nI'm fries it frustrates frustrated I Swear to God I Swear and when you know darn well they did it\nThat well that is true and\nIn any of our relationships whether it's family members are gathered that we work with us or wearing church organizations with we expect them to tell us the choice to have that integrity to speak\nThe truth and when you don't then it causes are raft and that is what you're seeing with the practice and campaigns\nAs people are saying look if she didn't mean it probably did you say and what people know about me is that they may not always agreed with

make a great senator and I hope the people of Tennessee understand that\nUm what are the issues because the economy's doing very well in Tennessee things are looking up we've had two years of great economic growth since Donald Trump's been president out of the people to Tennessee feel about the president's policies and and\nImportant vote the boats that you will be casting that if you become the next great senator from Tennessee\nAnd people still supported the president Donald Trump\nAnd say look to see his policies six said they want to give my singer he's going to be a conservative and it's going to support President Trump and his policy said well lord constitutional Supreme Court justices and federal judges\nThey want to keep the tax cuts the economy is so good in Tennessee it has the fastest growing median household income in the southeast\nAnd rest awesome battered for you to them fast they deserve trade\nYeah yes absolutely and I tell you something else the only thing the walls

doesn't\nHave any intentions to cause any harm or doesn't need assistance the minute you get here\n[noise] that's right and then in Paris, Tennessee today and Camden and I'm telling you Sean that is what people say this is why we need to walk this is why we need to make sure that sanctuary city policies are in that because\nMaybe the cooperatives that I always talk about or maybe health savings accounts they want that and I think Americans like the security of\nYou know not dropping a hundred and fifty billion taxpayer dollars on the on the landing strip of with cargo planes full of cash and other currencies for a rainy and ... the chant death to America I think they're happier with security we're better off than we were two years ago\nWell you're right and that's the question to say are
