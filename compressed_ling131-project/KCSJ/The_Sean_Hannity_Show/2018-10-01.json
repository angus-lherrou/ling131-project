find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind meantime\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that they interviewed several dozen people\nIn an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself\nNow that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her met a foggy slurring of words so that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh\nWhen he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all have the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis\nAnd it bend a ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ... rolls and then lining up\nIn the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations here look if as Byron York said the gold polls have moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI invest want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the best merge or actor assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember Dianne Feinstein\nIs for six long weeks\nShe had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh\nAnd then of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously record in lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats and she is the lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but he has a history of\nOh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney and so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor Ford this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing was sending to the right\nA professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein and they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety\nAnd this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI very expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about book and trees and gang rape and one email sent a late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an\nAll girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed\nNever cats need to find people who are familiar with what slang terms were used by Brett Kavanaugh on his yearbook page meant and the devil's triangle and the F F F F F a warnings in there if you can ... any of these are willing to sign an affidavit pleased contact us\nThat's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh\nWas at under the you know that one of your perjury in ... under the penalty of a felony here\nSo they all signed these affidavits all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection and the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony at it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave Paul said ... ... there's nothing else really left for them to do\nPlease use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say\nI mean well point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come forward please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week now is turning to because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of ... drink you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted and came to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was a school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to uh blacked out\nI worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for the people the numbers to and after two they lose it for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and as a throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individuals individual is is it's an enormous\nYou know you'd see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it was good if

investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBy the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got an interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor Ford that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remember Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women to accuse Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt\nThis is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent

want to be an America where somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated assaults

mean the accusation that somebody could observe them while he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that but what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge town\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassinate me or cheat I mean when you when you have when you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into\nA an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules to get what they want and I think that it's a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity

weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me it would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when\nYou know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example though you're getting you know women Blumenthal who the president

I I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people um it it could take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she said that every Democrat said that now they're going up but\nTrump is evil puppet master control in the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization you know it it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nTo hear your kind that are doing\nTwo weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know ... you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective\nOn that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a hat but I but it\nUp you know the parents who bought a reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because you know well the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews and they will confront people with testimony and other towns and\nKnow yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that\nBut for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am\nSomebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous and\nYou know the irony that says hey look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so\nThat's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI can't ...\nCan't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals but that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former your classmates asking them if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what do they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know\nWhat are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even sure it with him she said well how did he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I I mean price or even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nThey'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to include holy wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those three\nIt would have been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and
