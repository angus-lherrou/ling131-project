little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nGuy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live with their nuclear arms Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care\nAbout human life and as a result I Would assume that gets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a

demeaned the confirmation process\nYeah we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil you gotta be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fear is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think of\nHow you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want him to be afraid to their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a

getting their face kick them when they're down you know follow them in the gas stations in grocery stores\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what's your stand for what
