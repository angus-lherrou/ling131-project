D jays want to put Manny which had over there at second you know potentially you know that that's the thing it's there it's it's a monkey wrench into the in the cockpit I understand he's a great player\nBut then add him into a clubhouse Mike and you know how it works in in in particularly in baseball club houses\nUm there was a bond there and we really saw that a throughout this season as they went into the playoffs here how this a clubhouse was really clicking now it didn't translate in the national league divisional series but you bring in a high price sky that means you're telling somebody\nYou're not good enough well are you going to put it but no one spot you to put him in trouble spot you could put him in DJ spot or you're going to put him in your other high priced player and that's the end Desmond and make it play first\nAnd and I don't I don't know that you I mean if that's the case then go get a guy to play first base and and don't and don't pay as high a price on any Machado I again when you have no one story that moved just doesn't make any sense it's not as if you're looking to upgrade their\nRight I I absolutely agree with you and it and it frustrates and I understand fans looking at it and going well mainly Machado was out there we could have went out\nAnd gone and gotten him what could have gone out and gotten Christian or a yellow which\nAre at some point and and put him into the outfield as well but there is a plan for the Rockies and but black Saturday as we got into September even when things didn't go well\nUh when they played in that series against the Dodgers out their Chavez Ravine in the middle part of September of by the time they got back from Arizona they won those three in a row in the back have they said these are our guys we're not changing from this\nAnd they made a nice pushing got themselves to the end they'll DSL right back to the phone lines Gerard and castle rock kilo Gerard\nHey I'm doing great thanks good\nGood good eye you guys kinda stole my thunder a little bit before when I first called nobody had set it yet I was wondering about\nThe pitching is there the talent is there and you have these heavy hitters great that and yet you go to play off games that's Eighteen ending with out a run that's a problem when I mean these guys are electric I mean they've been killing it\nYou know is it mental I don't think you need to bring anybody I don't think I ... there there and like you said um most of the guys are going to come back next year so what do you do about ... ...\nI mean and one in Milwaukee and one game in court sealed so you can't say well the altitude I Can't say that two games to any without one run that's the problem\nI think that's fair Gerard and that's what I'm alluding to Corey and thanks for the call when I say the Rockies ... they look it's raw right now it might even be unfair to say it right now but this is what we're doing they have to take a hard look at that and say can we identify anything that could potentially prevent that in the future\nI I agree with you and we've talked about it on Rocky's reactive from time to time out or in the farm system you're trying to give the guys that are coming up through here we talk about the homegrown players are these guys have some championship experience or at least some playoff experience you\nKind of put them in elaborate situations or give them at bat in elaborate situations but there's nothing like playing in the in major league baseball and in the playoffs like this Mike I don't know if you can teach it but I agree with you I don't have an answer for it but I think they do have to take a hard look at it\nAnd maybe find themselves a bat but it it's not about that is going to help you throughout the season necessarily that's not what you're looking for you're looking for a veteran bat who can help you during the season\nBut then come through when you're playing those extra games in October we

I think he's a great ballplayer\nHe's a quiet you know you're quite professional on and on will be you know this year we wouldn't have made it to the playoffs\nThe question of course are not on next year and what about\nThe thing about the way and that's even then I think about it the second all you have to leave so I think it's like the last or said why would you do it curl up in all the people want to give them a lot of psychological and baseball is very like a lot\nThanks Doug I think that last one is a good one from an average standpoint the Rockies as we talked about earlier didn't do great but what were they Corey second in the national league in runs scored but I mean it wasn't that crazy yeah the differential was\nWas something that people point to all year and I think those are all fair points to look at I Do think you have to remember that they one Ninety One game since ... through all of it\nThat matters yeah have you in the end and you know at this point up a couple of times like you could sort through all the stats that you want but the fact is like one Ninety One game that they made it to the national league championship series it ends\nDisappointing that it ends after three games sweep here but at the same time progress I Believe is being made but there are two weeks it will have to be made as well and I think identifying maybe a veteran right handed back coming in here maybe and maybe somebody else for the bull fan I echo what was said by the caller though\nYou know I used to have that I'm On a piano back into the mix of things you look great this year yeah no doubt Corey thank you much great work\nI appreciate it like last night for me but I get out of here and I just want to say this unfortunately it makes me sad we could have seen the last

I don't know what the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly they're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not\nSoccer and that women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control that divide and conquer it's my oldest strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't give the whole list but exactly they want to throw granny over the cliff and now with Supreme Court justices\nOr if they have an opening ...

told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons ... that are of like last

investigation a number one first will work conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect but there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coaxed ally people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public and we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why were they supportive of Bill Clinton

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement\nWhat compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator her own out now is saying she wants an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar so a throwing ISIS like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're great and then I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you end up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\nWell I think we've got the votes\nIn some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the way he was treated\nAt the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused I'm not given up on him less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes most Democrats will know no matter who Donald Trump s\nRide they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona up most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race\nAnd do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\n... Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nWants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listed as viewers beyond that I\nDoubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but\nI think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically\nWe would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with\nThe seriousness the charge deserves I think ...

that statement\n... and they said she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge spike punch at parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she saw either man's spike it\nChanging the Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know fighting the punch putting Brian Hi I I saw him given rent solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame by him around the punch that one thing malls or the punch container is\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who are a number of these parties can remember I think everybody in the county remembers that and we have we haven't heard from less friends so I'm asking you know are there people live in today I had a party so yeah there are people that know about that part I have\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and haven't turned back\nRight twenty five now totally a top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would things you can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here\nTo put this on the air Byron York\nIs joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron\nHey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds a war on on the basis of the lack of governance and uh there's no way to store if you ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad\nBut it was given in part a due to the news networks I'm hearing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see as reported this is probably a good correct or at least we can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre just there just was nothing to this story um and when she offered a witnesses you could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nOn the other was deceased and didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker well the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens of dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out correct so did you become a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here you know ... question I go ahead where we are\nThe things that he claims yeah from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations\nNow they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today Vioxx published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking\nMischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr they gotta let it go there thank you so much Byron York with us sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean has a toll free telephone number as we continue from Washington DC we'll

Fox News tropical storm Michael is moving across the Caribbean and could be a hurricane by the time it makes landfall Florida governor Rick Scott declaring an emergency Sunday for high risk areas\nThe results are now in polling and we're seeing it in the Fox news poll that now shows that are Heidi Heitkamp was a no on judge cabin on North Dakota's she down by eleven it's going to be interesting to watch what Joe Manchin does Joe Donnelly in Indiana is a no\nUh we know Claire McCaskill is that no we a have a battle going out Martha ... I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a recipe is simple that says\nThe latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap does is closed almost two dead even\nAnd hauled and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heat in all of the states that are red states where where Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they ... they did everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans\nAnd there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me\nI just don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict is with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever the vista nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor for there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear\nCory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he's just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created four million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling than war in the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe you don't even know their name is\nWhile he used for your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns\nAre actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago\nCame back to the special one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both\nI think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they are either going to see ... happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or are they going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that because of the intensity\nOf anger about the way the liberals smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that the ... were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me what a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy I'm I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning I mean one one of the lessons you know I I had very close races\nYou guys can hear from the ... just today's growth

Andrew Weissmann in Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some document we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents\nFor the department of justice from but some of the keys documents including the so called McCain memos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually prove a I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting\nFor quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week\nWe are going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's been the middle of all of this and I\nSaid do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere there there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm\nHearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligent I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted there was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm\nHappy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy but\nSo anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of of their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you're talking about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a Rome people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations in you know soon thereafter at that I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nEndless of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... that\nThey had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't ... I think\nFirst ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a Pfizer Warren on the Trump\nCampaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all\nAbout you know media perception what are they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication\nYou're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\n... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right right the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and then um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back I Know media organizations have pulled lies about you or I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard\nBut the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nAs powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy no right so much in just undercover and\nYou know and even it it's funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations they started saying\nWell our bosses and want to [laughter] you know they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the\n... Mehra as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever oh don't go to Vladimir Putin's Russia stay out well President Trump has done a lot\nTo fix that situation I think you know there's a his his courage I I'm inspired by that and I think there's even that is going to be fixed overtime I'm confident Carter\nPage thanks for being with us we always appreciate you being here eight hundred nine ... is our number thank you sir\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe the news radio I'm I'm Robert attacks against now justice Brett Kavanaugh are being called false President Trump made the comments while speaking at a law enforcement convention this afternoon in Florida Trump says Kavanaugh should not have gone through what he went through\nWas a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evils any tufted out we'll tufted out together\nKavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate Saturday and quickly sworn in a second swearing in ceremony will be held tonight at the White House\nThe registered owner of the liberal company that was involved in this weekend's deadly crash in upstate New York was reportedly an FBI informant twenty people died over the weekend when the limousine crashed after failing to stop at an intersection the limos operated by prestige limousine which is owned by shed Hussein\nFloridians are being urged to prepare for hurricane Michael Florida governor Rick Scott every family must be prepared\nRemember we can rebuild your how do we cannot rebuild your life take this seriously think either family Michael\nBecame a category one storm today it could reach Florida's panhandle or Big Bend area by Wednesday as a category three hurricane bringing with it a storm surge heavy rain and dangerous wins\nA drunk driving incident is causing a U.S marine commander base in Australia to be discharged police caught colonel James Schnell driving under the influence of alcohol he pleaded guilty today to driving with a blood alcohol content more than double the legal limit in Australia Chanel commanded more than Fifteen hundred troops\nFacebook users are being warned about another hoax that's making the rounds more from Lisa Carter\nElated since on teams are thinking their accounts and then click on what the message saying that some of the county's been making friend request to use to us and asked to forward the message to their friends to chain reaction is led to thousands of people receiving the pointless messages\nStocks are beginning a new week mixed on Wall street today at the closing bell the Dow Jones industrial average is up forty points you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio\nSensors showers often on around here throughout the day today fifty for a high thirty eight for a little cloudy and forty April Hi on Tuesday closer to sixty Wednesday and Thursday\nBeing on call Sam accountable to you every day ... is on\nA twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program\nOh All right let's get to our phones I Know a lot of what voters wanted away in a lot of news happening today twenty nine days till election day there is a lot at stake and I think the biggest case to be made is are you better off\nThan you are two years ago\nHave things in America change for the better do you want this party of slander the party of blood shunning\nPeople's characters do you want them rewarded because this is who they are this is what defines up the ... the not the party of due process that not the party of the presumption of innocence they're the party a bludgeon\nFirst and win at all costs that's what that's what's at stake I Know it's hard to get people motivated for mid term elections oh I Hope this wakes you up I Hope this motivate you I Hope you know the stakes are high I Hope you know there's a lot in play here\nNow we know Harry yet another institution I broke and and the ... the ...
