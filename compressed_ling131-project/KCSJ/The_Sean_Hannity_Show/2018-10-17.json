NATO now pay their fair share when we pay Seventy two cents of every dollar for defense mostly of our Western European allies or\n... you know demanding better more fair trade deals with our Western European partners with Canada with Mexico people don't understand is if you don't threaten to pull out of a deal\nAnd you don't threaten terrorists you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past to ask for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous secure I don't care about it I I Want this concrete prosperous\nYou also did something that the mainstream media is not reporting on the twenty fifth of July the declaration of a cease fire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nPressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting is pretty joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and these trade agreements with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show hopefully owned by me back I think he gets a trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that would tell me right now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nOf course yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled or it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it done shortly thereafter\nOr because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very core of but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government are and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why he's doing so well ... and by the way you know back its guy ever Sean I'm doing a lot of traveling around the country I was in Detroit last night I spoke reporter people I'm Down here in Miami Today and the whisper rate is up you know that whispering were ... telling people that they don't like Trump and then they pull you aside at his age Sean by the way\nI happen to really like\nOtherwise isn't that what this group there is an intensity of his

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just order this guy and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri or their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's pleading at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I said what about other things she came here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we Maxine Waters on\nTape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five then we see\nThe center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's eh thing beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appealed to moderate through the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in\nAny sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute capital was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart\nThey still didn't care and I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you've got these anarchists middle class of managers attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist trying to stop him from taking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she said the number that quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley that's her opponent would be part of fraudulent embedding someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work

upper sixties for the weekend\n[noise]\n\nAlec Baldwin's favorite radio talk show host is on the air right now right Mr mall when [laughter]\nHere's Sean Hannity\nIf there was a twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on the fly is the most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it isn't backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do is come out and apologized to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not proud of and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax hikes and now I'm not not partisan gridlock in Washington so that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren ... release officers racist\nMe I call them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this\nMessage that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren well she does have to get re elected a senator if she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American\nWe can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow wild chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American in a professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but\nYou know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nA show and great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm stuck around one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when it's not tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republicans for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about the safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "17"}
