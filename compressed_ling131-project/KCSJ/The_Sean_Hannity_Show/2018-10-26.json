would but to see it up close and reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very

been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day you know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through the time it was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nAnd I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and is it do they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said\nMr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I said this only because um\nThere's this idiot\nOn fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nRestaurant had and he says had a direct language may we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echo an amplified by Fox News and other folks and the conservative jets yeah but the nearest not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and when she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden it becomes ... a Robert Deniro I was calling the president devil and us devil worshippers in effect you know\nA piece of playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the tissue to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's ... he's a dog he's a pig he's a\nCon artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework\nDoesn't care Dixie gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country it makes me so angry that this

our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all you see a\nPattern between the president's attacks on Twitter and and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this

I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLittle like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they picked up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focus they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change [noise] think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes they're legal this stuff and he'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know\nUs pollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same marry you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing they\nBarely even when they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he is right to say that\nThe Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much from Trump that is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate were much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt the ... one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat
