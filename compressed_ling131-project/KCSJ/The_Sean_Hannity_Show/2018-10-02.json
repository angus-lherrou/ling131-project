she's coming down on this although she rightly said was Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one to answer the answer is thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida a from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's

investigation finds\nPlausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large but it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I

week we have any any timetable idea\nProbably don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement\nWhat compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly\nAny credible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and said this changed anything I Hope we don't\nMove the goalposts Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary

Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the way he was treated\nAt the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict at the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug he's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump\nMight be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald Trump ...\nThey've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota\nWants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but\nI think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can\nI find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding\nOf what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is that I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness\nThe charge deserves a them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made a gun and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Kevin\nThey have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you run for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist the point I'm massaging as the homophobic Xena phobias Lama fold you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children and it's going to be a look\nBut like if you're throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long and now which Supreme Court nominees this lander has been taken to a whole new level do you have a night throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\nNBC News radio I'm I'm Robert\nThe New York times as President Trump earned a fortune by helping his family dodged taxes the paper claims Trump earn the equivalent of more than four hundred million dollars by setting up a sham corporation that helped hide gifts from his parents the times also says Trump helped his father make millions of dollars of improper tax deductions a Trump lawyer calls the allegations are false and defamatory\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer is calling for the FBI to fully briefed the Senate at least twenty four hours before the vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a growing\nConsensus in the Senate that when the FBI investigation is complete the finding should be released publically\nWith any personal information rejected\nMeanwhile Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says Democrats practice the politics of personal destruction President Trump is praising the national economy we have\nThe best economy in our history\nStock market today just at another record high that's the hundred I think is one hundred and three times since I'm\nPresident that we've hit a new high speaking at an electrical contractors convention in Philadelphia today Trump also cited job growth and low unemployment\nRice in may have been male to the Pentagon the FBI is investigating after two pieces of mail reportedly tested positive for the potentially deadly substance CNN says the envelopes were quarantined after being flag that a separate screening facility\nPasadena, California police are looking for the person who fatally stabbed at twenty two year old man in the rose bowl parking lot lieutenant Jason ... says officers found Dimitri oh tap your junior with ... last night\nOr medics recalled the scene but as the paramedics arrived or the victim was pronounced dead on the scene standard protocol of investigations were followed and the area was cordoned off and witnesses were tend to be located\nPolice bleed tap you knew the suspect and they had been in a fight stocks were mixed on Wall street but the Dow was a hundred twenty three points to a day to a new all time high you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio [noise]\nCensor showers of other stores eighty five for a high ...
