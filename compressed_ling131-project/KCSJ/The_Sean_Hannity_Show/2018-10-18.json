that's certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing or the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new lipstick violence a which in the end I think\nTurns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um you know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it\nWasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract and I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not they're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments are and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater or fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and his ... and I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna\nTeach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done um they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because\nIf they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned this on your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and Carol van I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination the childish behavior by US Senators incentive meetings\nI think all that came together to really really galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan\nComing up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala actually four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams or who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says that she doesn't want to draw any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California who openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of illegality the ...\nPeople are talking about the Cold War with China I leave after the story but we have a pretty big issues which I I Would rather tackle
