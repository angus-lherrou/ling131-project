they will put the the the pressure cooker on you whereas like if a Democrat does it if a democratic does it does it they just they look the other way because they say well this person's too valuable it's like the whole Spartacus moment is a great example okay\nRemember when Cory Booker had his whole fake Spartacus moment where he said you know you can kick me out of the Senate and I may be kicked

couldn't get it right away like all the other text messages we had to wait until the final report\nRight now or to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the deal Jay face consequences\nRegarding vice well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker\nHe was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAny way now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source\nDirectly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI I remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel as soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nReg Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from Margaret in may and they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting dreams come you're not being roses have a a McKay and a stroke page\nIt's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... through I'm sure record talking about the history book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI investigating a crime here that\nFact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas only ... well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt is isn't that drama the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is just a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the

firing of combing number two we was the one that that recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the fourth financial advisor warrant\nIn other words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the hoped she'd say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker said it Baker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following as\nWe as a pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funnel money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dot CA that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who've guy by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents about Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton ourselves and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being behind\nThe Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications Sean Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nGreg Garrett you got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composes it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose

you cannot\nUse double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an a counterintelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de

hadn't even begun to substantiate process and get through using it presenting it as a statue to verify the court when you look at this\nPoint they willingly lied before buys a port and light it as an

have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas MD in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor\nYeah All right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total\nIn forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise] um and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care bound Asian you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice health are pushing me was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create ... ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWondering insuring it using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone wants to talk about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock\nGather news and who's now offering free health care for everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved service provides

vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics and he's a Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democrat Party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise] um and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America\nThat this was a process of the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation a ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is done and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host at a at a parasite at this point they're the same\nThing they have she end up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this if this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made

[noise]\nEven if they run counter to our hopes\nIn a courtroom truth is about credible evidence [noise] strong opinions\nNow there's a lot of talk about ... ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and belief\nAnd that's the way we operate and if it's wrong sometimes it is if you find out as in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up as David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phony Clinton bought and paid for dot the aid that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's\nThe one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under old and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over\nThe terms of the testimony and he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews and those closed Rosenstein\nAnd say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nWell interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh\nIs is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nAnd he got the people best able\nTo engineer to things software right it and make sure that it could be built a scale in case massive numbers of people wanted it\nYou want it to be durable you want it to be a reliable you want it to be easy to understand it needs to be mass produced civil\nYeah I mean for something like this to work and has to accomplish a lot of things and that's what the team it's simply say has accomplished this is a security system that introduced the notion of using ... signals in your home to connect all the components instead of wires\nThat those two things\nIt allows you to do the installation yourself which is nothing more than using the crack and feel tape on the back of the centers and detectors as you put them throughout the house that's all it is you put them or you want to be stuck in there on the doors and windows the walls wherever you want them\nYou deploy the motion detectors where you want them you do you have security age the cameras in mountains occasionally if you want them on the ceiling built into the wall or what have you but it's all up to you but the fact that there are no wires means everything you don't have to build out walls build them back and
