it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war

aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to take on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nBut it's really look at like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the Julian Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up in the polls\nAre dug so where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think we're America stands and John and you are right\nOn fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think the New Jersey will go all the way because of his eight operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite so and I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective in the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look I yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the thing numbers John please go ahead\nThen there's an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a\nNationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did\nAnd it appears to have backfired particularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular\nFor let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for a pastor and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know bread on the news just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that\nThey're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats had not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that didn't work for eight years dug and the\nWhite white Donnelly withholding a bit of a leading Indiana is say a heat by you saying go the wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out of Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we'd be doing a lot better I think you'd probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on Snowden's money so so you know raising enough money yeah ... that's what it's all about\n... and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September and a national holiday there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want to ask you close your speaker didn't only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said no\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that they're chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or or will they owe their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so they\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you it's a for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars to the races right now\nWhat in the patio and he's ... Republicans project very tossed released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign\nTo lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us and to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of Claire McCaskill\nTo say one thing privately another thing publicly it tells me Democrats to when they have to they can expose who they are if they can't talk about impeachment which they want\nThey can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that I mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and then I Hope\nYou are exempt me from being a person\nWill hire them to you but you know nobody's been listening to you because they were listening to you have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you take that as well as the fact that I mean notes on sale radical left so I I'm I'm a center right\nListen I your your style a Democrat listen this is a party that kicked out Joe Lieberman Lieberman is one of the most the Thin Man ever you know he's very very\nTop of his great on on national security issues horrible on social issues nicest person in the world but he's not left enough for the Democrats and they threw him out and he came back and won but I mean it says everything you need to know about the modern radical Democratic Party of Schumer and Pelosi\nAnd inhaling that Democrats would be better with that but yeah\nI Will take a break and we'll come back more de dum cha own and John McLaughlin are pollsters are next half hour we got a lot more to get into later on Michael Dell in Dr Sebastian Gorka will join us a Bill O'Reilly is going to check in with us today is book a skyrocket it right to number one on the New York times list in week one\nMigrants claim they're fleeing poverty and violence and are making their way to the U.S Mexico border President Trump threatened to shut down that border with National Guard troops to stop them from entering the U.S us\nOfficials are targeting a Russian woman for election interference NBC legal correspondent Pete Williams\nHer name is Elaine up cushy a Nobel she's forty four she's from St Petersburg now she's been charged here but obviously she's not in the United states so she's not under arrest the indictment\nIs not related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen presidential election\nWisconsin police are providing troubling new details about the disappearance of Thirteen year old Jamie ... the teen one missing Monday shortly before her parents were found dead in their home investigators say nine one one call place from a cost home came from her mother's phone devotees responded and found the door had been kicked in and both Denise cost and her husband James had been shot\nJamie was believed to have been in the home at the time of being so then the police have been unable to locate the teen and fear for her safety\nThe u._s. was calling off a scheduled air defense drill with\nSouth Korea to give nuclear talks with the north a better chance of success defense secretary James Mattis and South Korean counterparts made the decision at a meeting today in Singapore who wants to be a billionaire a lottery officials now say tonight's mega millions jackpot will be worth one billion dollars these folks would immediately stopped working if they won ... it'd be the first thing I ...\nI Would not go back into the office in ecstatic absolutely not all about long ago I'll probably start my own business somewhere else and you know these are\nThe jackpot a second to a twenty sixteen Powerball jackpot which was worth one point five billion dollars this weekend would be a good time to make a wish are falling star the ... meteor shower will peak on Sunday night you're listening to the latest from NBC News radio [noise]\nSunny nice around what book today sixty April Hi thirty four furlough sixty eight comes back on Saturday sunny and beautiful on Sunday was Seventy two for a high\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate of ships [noise]\nOoh [noise] that's\nNot your heartbeat crumble showing Sean's army on Twitter where where you get ...
