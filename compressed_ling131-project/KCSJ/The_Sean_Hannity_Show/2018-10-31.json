having the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did a forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nThe house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening\nThought um where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range between the bottom of about two oh one\nWhich would mean below sea ... hiring them around to twenty thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up his speaking um and I can't I've been in all honesty you know I've always been standard though I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nKnow I Can't either I really can't I mean and I think and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea would win the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about

going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody we run into some of the claims or a moderate Democrat\nHands for the poor for a leader can say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course

eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when Orange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they have zero zero in on us\nThis is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California\nRaised as being that important but now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in in which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm ... exactly yeah so\nTell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\nYeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years as you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nTo where you had overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on me after the the return over the Democrats\nSo we are seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins but the houses just harder to figure and\nI don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment or to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out and vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAh and the Democrats have thirty nine and sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nGet one of the ... you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide\nTaxation of states like California and New York\nIllinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of them a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThe union's control Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may start to see that money go out of the hands of the of the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think is pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so uh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nIt's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out

well beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and I I I'm\nIn that business as well so for me that's ridiculous\nI I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on health care as a situation because when they rolled out before to CARE Act became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and um I paid extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's tests that I've had 'em\nThat are no longer covered and uh yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up yet again and less coverage getting gang for tests and things that used to be covered and just I Want everybody to get out there and vote because we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was was calling to talk about the health care\nI've got to tell you right now or it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to bring them I'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep her plans have less and fundamental ... it's been a failure and the fact that it was true none of it was true was one of the biggest
