when it snows I told you I like the ritual on foreign relation with the iron you gotta get iron and fertilizer here in the Rocky Mountain so whatever your choice grabs the fertilizer do they get it down and then stand by as the as the snow comes okay winter rising sprinklers here's a\nHere's a just a typical email I got several this week\nPlease advise what we should do today to winter riser sprinkler without blowing the amount of charge you say not the blowout go over it because we got cold weather coming up we do and I will go over that now maybe in the next hour also\nUh so yeah I I I think we discuss this a little bit last week and we have this discussion actually every year at this time\nI'm not a big believer in blowing out sprinkler systems\nModern sprinkler systems usually can get by without being\nPurged with compressed air because we need to typically do when\nThere watering our winters in the last Fifteen Years or give or take have gotten really dry and the law you can get desiccated the roots can dry out and that's where that winter kill comes from\nA next spring so I Believe in the winter ... now you get a winner water if you want to dragging hoses frozen hoses around sprinklers or if you want to I don't like doing that because you don't get good coverage\nYou always there's always coverage lacking when you have a manual a sprinkler so I liked that winter water with my sprinkler system\nSo I Believe in the winter rising the system but not in blowing it out\nAnd what do I mean by that and we'll look oppressed errors service will blow all of the water out of all of his own zone valves and the and the hedge themselves so the system is pretty well totally dry and you this theory is you believe it that way until next spring\nWould I like to do is to turn the water off when it's going to get cold outside my water office is off right now when it gets cold out turn the water off in the house and the utility room typically\nA and a and there's a little valve I have next to my shut off that I opened that drains the water out of that pipe that I go outside and there's a single valve like a little Fawcett but I open up to that\nDrains water from the outside piping we get air and both ends of the sprinkler system and it's all said the pipes that our vote vulnerable we have now protected those at the heart pipes they're either copper or BBC or a mixture of both actually that are hard pipes and they're very vulnerable to freezing\nAnd when the temperature gets down below say thirty degrees or so the\nThe maximum expansion of frozen water is around twenty seven Fahrenheit but when it gets down in the mid thirties overnight\nYou need to turn that sprinkler system off because it could be mid thirties at the airport and low thirties or high twenties if you're in a low spot in your particular town so protect the pipes on the outside of the house\nThe hard pipes that really can freeze\nThe sprinklers own valves in that green box during during those this should be a matter of turning two maybe three valves or on the ... the the main valve inside you turn off in there the other voucher turn on the air and it with the water dribble out and you're all set and the reason is that the modern sprinkler systems are piped\nWith that polyethylene black shiny pipe\nOut in the yard zones themselves\nThe spike is fairly flexible so even if there is a little freeze up or or maybe some slush that forms inside the pipe the pipe can absorb that expansion and be OK without breaking are cracking\nA generally speaking if you turn your sprinkler system off after a few days the pipes are full of water anyway because you get some natural drainage leakage of evaporation so those pipes out and they are they're just trying so you're all said and you want to rise the vulnerable pipes that come out of the house\nAnd the zone valves themselves and just wait and if we get\nA dry winter like we've typically had the last uh last few years then for weeks or so three or four weeks on a warm Sunday afternoon maybe during a bronco game you can run outside and and water your yard you just simply reverse the process during those little valves off during the main water supply on\nAnd in turn your clock on your sprinkler clock and just cycle through the zones and there's your winter watering this is especially important if you as I Do if you have a zone sprinkler zones in your flower beds I have\nA flower bit of flowering perennials in front of it has a few bulbs in it some uh some day lilies and and it's got irises and out back I have to look and\nDaffodils and allium and things like that the bulbs underground or you can't really see right now they need a little water a drink of water occasionally young bushes young trees and your garden and general rose bushes also if you can arrange to have those winter watered every month or so in the winter season that's a good deal so underwater it's a big deal around here\nBecause the ground doesn't you know and listen to the grounds frozen you can't winter water but generally speaking the ground is not stay frozen very long so you can winter water every three or four weeks and your law ... thank you for it they'll have a healthy lawn especially if you fertilized like right now\n\nWonder water but generally speaking the ground is not stay frozen very long\nDo you do that when it's all drained and everything is all the water is drivel doubt that's going to come out go to your sprinkler clock and slowly cycle through each his own just to release any a vacuum or any any uh sealed it might be in there that's close you want to\nActivate the zone bell for five seconds or so or it'll open up the uh the the little bladder little washer inside and like water dribble out also see cycled through each of those zones and turn the clock totally off years might say yours might say rain or it might might just say off but turn the clock totally off you don't want any energy\nElectricity and going through his own valves of there's no water there to be the run through the the valve itself so there you go that's when a rising a sprinkler system without blowing it out now\nFinally the last comedy out here is if you have an old fashioned sprinkler into some of you an older neighborhoods older homes might have a sprinkler system that has steel galvanized pipes or white PVC the hard plastic lives out in the yard those must be blown out\nPurged with compressed air because they'll freeze up in a heartbeat if there's water inside but for those of and I suspect is over Ninety five percent of the audience as the shiny black polyethylene pie that's not subject to freezing doesn't freeze ... I'd listen I've haven't blown my sprinkler system out and\nTwenty five years or so so same thing with you you don't need to blow it out wonder water every month or so and your lawn will be grateful\nHis little me healthy next spring as we began to another\nRocky Mountains and things in their head back to real three seven one three\nWhere are all experts when it comes to safety and thankfully laugh but she's not go for electrical safety as well as your cat an energy cooperative we're here to teach you and your family story on the side [noise] that's why we get down to our electrical safety glasses and you can bring electrical safety practices to you learn how\nTo learn more about the power and you are ... members said to gather we said dot com\nBust your last caller has touched on energy and whoever it is a tri state of\nIt's the worst they May Day Adam ... dollar gas rally entire rainy out\nAnother chance for you to weigh in on thousands of dollars coming up on five after the hour every hour Monday through friday pouring am in ...

grab that one and put it on today because it's going to snow tomorrow stand in Pueblo your American load around the house hello Stan\nKen I'm I've got a quick question I heard you're talking about the bone up sprinkler systems yeah and just curious what pressure I have a hundred and ten or hundred quite town a compressor\nA and I'm curious about what assure you what you just don't\nI don't think it matters that much stand up I don't I wouldn't a hundred and twenty sounds a little high to me is can you regulate the pressure\nThat's what I'm Wondering I'm ... I can regulate it what should I what should I regulated down to\nWell I was going to say it it it it matters less what the pressure is it matters more just to make run it until the water is gone because the water will eventually be purged out\nSo I Would I Would want to be down around Seventy five or so give or take because that's the kind of the pressure we run and sprinkler systems a hundred and twenty pounds or you don't want a blowout fittings or you know you know clams that might be a little loose or whatever so I'd get a down below that why are you going to blow it did you hear my little by little\nA kind of monologue about not blowing up sprinklers\nYes I'm the first year I um didn't bowed out I have white quite underground old and you had blow it out yeah a lot of guys are ... a ... a spring\nYeah I think I did say that will galvanize Steeler PVC piping underground you have to blow 'em out yeah okay\nThat's what I Am now on the white or\nWhen they started how many days would take to do it because like I said all I got one bathroom\n[noise] yeah well as long as you know you are you just doing your shower at your shower tub is that all you're doing\nNow I Want to do the the whole thing I Want to get a smaller vanity and make it more compact 'cause it's a small bathroom anyway uh-huh his lot because I'm older now and I just want to safety wise to\nYou want it to convert your shower to a ton of is that what you're saying\nNo uh\nShower or ... I thought okay I misunderstood you up to our\nYeah that's fine well listen as long as it is this is your only bathroom there'll be aware of that and they'll keep the toilet in place a till the last minute\nAh and then you know if you're going to replace the toilet I mean that's just a simple on and off kind of thing so long as you have a toilet for a few days and you can get along listen most companies should be able to do this once they get mobilized and get all the\nTile on site and all the parts they need and maybe the shower enclosure and so in a two or three days would be my\nGuest to do a good job so the one day company I don't know I guess it's possible I Would want to look at their ratings on line to see how happy other homeowners are with them is for I don't have a\nSpecific referral for you but what part of town are you and you are in West Denver west Denver you know if somebody's listening this had this done before remodeled bathroom and it was really happy with the contractor will put their name on the air if they want to call and otherwise I go to my website around the house dot com there's a\nThere's a blog area there for Denver small contractors I might start picking the through those names and see if you find anybody in there that this looks like they've done this before it's something they enjoy doing and uh and uh I I ... I see your concern\nWith only one bathroom but the main the main obstacle will be the toilet but you can arrange to have that changed really quickly and stuff is the main thing is the tub in the shower so it's you know when you when you're going to make this conversion is a little uh it's complicated because there's so many trades involved\nThere's plumbers and ... people drywall or isn't famers and carpenters there's just a lot of different trades involved in so that that's what drags it out a little bit I mean finishing the drywall alone or unless you cover it all with tile the new drywall will take two or three days to float and tape\nBecause at the drive between coach and that sort of thing but you could discuss this with a contractor but make sure you get to and even the three bids is good because this these\nPrices can vary a lot\nBased on how busy the contractor is sometimes they'll shoot you a high number because they're really busy but if they get the job they make a lot of profit so I Would shop around and the the one thing I Need to run to a break but the one thing I Want to leave you with more than anything else\nThat we've talked about this twenty five years now in the program and that is the homeowner referrals Internet ratings are okay as far as they go I don't totally trust them but homeowner referrals\nYet the names of the last couple of homeowners they did the ... similar work for and call him any company that's worthwhile that is proud of their work should be willing to give you share the name of owners with you that they've done this work for and just talk to them and that's the best\nReferral of all and the best recommendation of\nHomeowners just like yourself good luck Paul let us know how it goes we'll be right back real three\nTo Ben in Aurora good morning sir how are you a good morning I'm drier than it goes up the rough it important to claim that out or not or the boat to blow dryer\nYeah ... well actually a drier events the vertical and there's more and more of those because the rules on the length of drier events that are allowed have changed\nIn many builders find that they just have to go vertical to meet the rules yeah they require cleaning out probably more often than horizontal or does it you know I have my rule of thumb is spending your clean out your vertical drier than twice a year and maybe once a year for horizontal\nThe good news is you don't really need to do much to assisted what'll happen\nBecause of gravity Ben is the is the material will rise up into that pipe and kind of collect and then fall back down some vertical drier events tend to accumulate everything at the bottom of the event itself so if you move the drier back\nUh you'll see a clumps linked in there that you just suck out with your shop that they don't tend to accumulate Lynch a an ... of them on the event in the upper end a nearly as much as horizontal Stu now\nYou know maybe every couple of years or you might want to go up there with a ladder or has the hire somebody and pop that cap off to look for any accumulation up there but it will be mostly because of gravity at the bottom behind the drier\nSo I Would look at that twice a year yeah\nYeah that makes sense and I really appreciate it\nYou got it good to hear from you yeah dry urban clean outs important uh you know there have been and thankfully very rare instances of fires caused by plugged up Dr events the Lincoln catch fire it's as I say quite rare and thankfully\nBut you don't want to do accumulate for safety reasons and because it takes longer to dry your clothes\nAnd the effects are very gradual\nYou know you might have been able to dry a load of\nOf T shirts a a year ago in uh in in twenty five minutes and now takes\nForty minutes and you don't really notice the difference but trust me it's costing you more electricity and most of us dry with electricity which is the most expensive energy source or at all more the more expensive between uh you know if you've ever have a chance to get a gas drier they're much more energy efficient\nAnd require much less money to dry given load of clothes but nevertheless you want to clean the drier than out at least once a year\nThe way to do it with a traditional horizontal drier event is to go outside take the vent cap off outdoors and lay it to one side and then put a leaf blower\nOr on the on the drier end of the events and just blow all that lent out in the end of the yard and you can catch it was on some plastic or in a bushel basket or something and\nUh and there you go it's it's a very efficient way to clean out your dryer one end to the other to important\nOnce a year at least check it and then once in a while I just say this you got to the front of the drier off because Lincoln accumulates inside the drier as well if you go to Youtube video of how to do that it's quite easy\nTo take very long or you can also take care of your drought we'll be right

Wilcox concealed\nThat's where I think this law crack as is and the weather window hats and as an accent that I Can't tell where it actually you know\nWhen you say accent ... a piece of sticks out\nLike a coral or or yeah okay very good yeah\nAnd I think that ... that is yeah here on to the wall to give it for ... and then ... ...\n... that's a great description yes well is the first thing to do as you indicated to go inside to make sure every little little tiny Nick and crack and and you know to the stress crack\nA is totally sealed with a good acrylic exterior silicon iced acrylic talking a and then step back and see the answer your question stucco or a mold a issues with stucco\nOr it's not that they're common but once you have um they're hard to repair and they're very insidious because you don't notice them for a while now they are after system\nA is more vulnerable I think because there were you may have read or heard about all the class action lawsuits especially on the east coast from improper installation of windows doors decks and so on if you're a traditional stucco\nA cock everything and then stand back and see what's going on otherwise we may have to\nWhat may have happened is they may not have slashed the window properly\nOr wondering and they're very specific ways like for instance the vertical pieces go on first and the horizontal and it's it's very it's a step by step thing is very specific\nTo keep water from getting behind the wall and they may not have done it properly in which case you'll have to remove at least the corner of that decorative element uh that uh the other we call it a pop out sometimes up and up may have to remove that and see what's going on behind their okay so\nI said I Am thinking as if they pull that off at ... than I can do that um and then look at the window and that's how I get in there and Koch everywhere and around before we put that back\nOn did I misunderstand you or did you say you're going to have this window replace now\nAround the asking outlets sixteen thousand that we would like to avoid that yeah but I think that people will say out the window has to be replaced in order to fix the

have a wonderful winter and be able to to ah make a joyful recovery and re grow in the spring so fertilize right now today good I'd good time to do that\nLet's see um [noise] and I'm doing a here's an email from Laura said Mr dino\nIs highly recommended nice guy I'm uh just um of recommend them highly so thank you Laura for that appreciate that that he has an interesting question um she has sewer gas in the house I think you discuss this before but what do you do to limit to eliminate the smell of sore gas in your house I have and use the washer\nFour months in the basement really started to smell ... is a dangerous when you to call a plumber uh no I mean it's listen ... gas is basically methane and hydrogen sulfide and it can be dangerous in high concentrations that's why people that worked on and sewer lines and so on were breathing equipment but\nIn the small concentrations in your house it's usually not dangerous or a problem it just smells and it's very irritating and a an off putting if you will so yeah it's usually easy to fix usually comes up\nThrough floor drains or tubs or showers are laboratories that you don't use very often all plumbing fixtures have a trap underneath sometimes you can see the trap like under the bathroom sink and sometimes you can't it's hidden under the basement floor but the traps usually full of water\nAre in the water is that makes a seal and keeps us or gas from coming into the house will if you don't use a floor drain and most of us don't it just the water just evaporates and lets the sewer gas in and you can simply poor more water and if you'd like floor dreams are usually you say your basement laundry\nIs smelling we'll that's typically work for drain is down there so you can dump a a a ... half a gallon of water in there once a week if you'd like the other answers to use of mineral oil mineral oil is a light oil that will sit in the trap and not evaporate but it'll\nBe pushed out of the way of water gets into the trap but nevertheless mineral is a good thing to seal the trap with relatively permanently\nSo that settles that floor drain issue it should be somewhere near the furnace or or water heater Betty in your house and once you pour the men are loyal and they're the smell will tend to go away unused drains like maybe your laundry you're not doing laundry\nOften as you used to you said the showers tubs\nLaboratories that maybe for guests only don't could use very often need to run water and those about once a week to keep the surrogate smell out of the out of the house and also flush those toilets at least once a week and unused bathrooms and that's kind of the story to keep the odor out of your house All right let's talk to\nUs to talk to a gym in Westminster good morning Hi how are you\nCan't how are you today I'm doing well what's up with you and with all\nDue respect or I just don't recommend that you tell people not to blow up the sprinkler systems because you know with me work and what these things for the last Thirty years uh-huh I got to France or with people for years and now my next door neighbor\nUm highly or where she did I mean you use as a solar shot and now that we're talking five thousand dollars for a redo [noise]\nBut they are all depends if you know your sprint consistent how deep it is ... material this\n... thing comes in two different uh pressures that comes in eighty PSI and a hundred you saw it in a law that might matter but you also got them plastic veterans in there that are\nAnd you're out there that can break but I met during exactly what you're suggesting as far as uh you know like a pre you know I'm a pressurized fishing\nYou know that's you know this you know there's a quick for is coming up and that would certainly what you are saying you know my American press route to blow it out\nYeah I think I don't know I I you know listen I'm Jim I'm not here to say that it it it never going to have you can never have a problem but most modern system seemed to get through the winter okay without blowing them out so that's kinda my experience you said you had a shower installation comment too damn\nNear her and um I have had this one I have done plumbing\nAnd he didn't come out they're kind of expensive but I Do a um I did enjoy their work because they're highly recheck or permit now we had a turban and also um\nNo just you know you're just can't put a shower and you're automatically I mean you got to make sure you're harming as we mentioned and a half a drain", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Around the House", "city":
