{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "Although I don't know if they're in Los Angeles for for what are my favorite of all I Want to go out and make a difference I didn't find that working behind a desk so familiar with the officer serve argument for her was just hard\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard\nBroadcasters association at this station radio pretty affordable system isn't it uh\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um hospital possible hospitalizations I'm I'm a fall and especially laying there for a long time and\nIt's definitely something that you can be proactive with an an affordable product and that can help keep families safe and keep ... parents at home longer and independent and help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know\nThat if they were to have a fall that um that it's just that push the button and they can get help\nUm and actually we do have some um units that have followed the catching them\nSo with that ah technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be unable to push a button and it very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help and even if a button isn't pushed so um that's just\nThat's really great for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there are no one's around that they do fall under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independence that they're really seeking and then after that of course you've got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but what a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it small\nUm it's not bad and ah the one with the fall detection has to be one around the neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more in on the wrist and those are mostly for people that are more and just in the in the home\nUm by themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them and but with the ones around the neck we have some that actually are a mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all detection and um and\nAnd if they were to fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood and it would detect that fall or they could push a button and then it has GPS locating in it so that um help would be able to find them where they are\nOkay so if somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do we get it set up how hard is it to get it set up moms though\nIt's it's very easy um again you can just call the same number that you call for that the safety of senior conference that's our main lifeline number it's five for five one two one two and\nAnd just give us your name information and we will just figure out what kind of questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need 'em\nTo get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get mom or dad set up and so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nInto the plugs into the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it\nUses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape but that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah this is good so\nIf some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil I think I'll pass on that I'll just hollowed out for the neighbor\nYou know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this is lifeline that they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in ...\nTwenty six years ago and now look at it going all the way to Durango and and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of books grannies\nYou'll learn a little tiny towns and it's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and whether you're in assisted living whether you're an independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids\nI mean what a great what a great opportunity to have that extra hand in the house for under fifty\nBucks a month yes definitely what is it number to call once more five for five one two one two great that's so easy to remember five for five to one too so yeah\nWe be thinking about life line if you don't already have it I Know that they could uh probably take care of your pretty pretty quick\nYeah and I did I did want to mention that they don't even have to have a a land line at home and we also have a mobile units and even with our new go safe to button and that doesn't have to be connected to the base unit at all so under a lot of different options depending on if they still have a home phone or if they have a mobile device\nUsing technology grant and this is the thing

for us and for you this appearances are always extremely popular and we get lots of calls and I know you look forward as I Am having John with us next Saturday on the around the house a program [noise]\nLet's see some email from this week we can get started here whatever's on your mind give us call thrill three seven one three to five five uh this is from Dick ... with the septic tank I liked the uh uh I I Want to know the best way to unplug\nToilets and sinks in tubs that are really slow I've got a septic tank and do I use drain cleaner or what it wants to know well\nA ... my view on a septic tank is the less chemicals you put in the better or is a delicate microbial balance in a septic tank you don't want to disturb that because the bacteria there are processing the sewage sludge falls to the bottom of the tank and the sewage gets eaten up if you will do which is\nI Know it's an odd way to put it but it gets the process by the bacteria\nSo you don't want to do anything that will interfere or kill friendly bacteria and that would apply to most\nDrain cleaner they're pretty harsh there are some septic friendly drained cleaners that are enzyme based uh that you could you could try but I\nBut I liked the idea of mechanical cleaning you really don't need\nA sewer cleaning chemicals for most fixtures in your house it just helps to clean the junk out of the trap now a and mechanical cleaning is the easiest thing of all because he simply get yourself a brush a sewer cleaning or drained cleaning brush usually they have a kind of a\nA long wire handle on him that you can bend around corners and so on others one brand name has called the turbo brushed but nevertheless they looked like a\nBottle brush memory you know when you have little babies in your house\nUh years ago we would use of bottled brush to clean out the baby's bottles before we sterilized and the same idea here only this this this rush the bristles are\nSmaller diameter only an inch inch and a half or so and as long wire handle and most of these and you're simply ... in in the drains that you're worried about you simply just shove it down in there like the the maybe your master bathroom shower\nIs full of hair and other gunk and you just ran this brush good pop the little dream screen off first of course\nAnd run this terrible rash down into the drain and pull the junk back out of the drain the trap and\nAnd put it in a paper towel and roll it up and put it in the trash that's very very easy without using chemical drained cleaners the same idea with the laboratory but the laboratories a special case because you could get to the trap underneath with tubs and showers of course\nThe trap is still there but it's hidden it's away from access for you so that terrible rash really works well in terms of showers with a laboratory you use the same brush if you want to\nBut it's just as easy to put a bucket under the sink\nAnd take that trap apart and dump it all into a into the bucket and clean it out then you can use your terrible brush to clean the pipe that goes into the wall sometimes\nYou know is it a lot of the culprit here are are is dental floss that gets caught in there or if you drop a vitamin pill down in the laboratory drain those all act to clog up the drain and trap junk as it tries to get down into the sewer so you can clean all that piping out clean the trap out\nUh with easy access under laboratory but with the top of the shower\nThe mechanical dream cleaning a is a is a good deal if you have\nPeople in your house like a you know your wife or daughters have long hair that tends to get in the drain you you might uh in the tub and showers you might want to put a little drains screening there there's a I think the name is actually a hair screen\nA little plastic gizmo that has a bunch of holes drilled in it or that you put over the existing drain and uh the hair will be trapped on that on that plastic disc and you can throw it in the bathroom wastebasket but it keeps at\nThat hair a hair is really the enemy of drains of traps and showers and in tub so if you can trap that hair it's better than getting it down the drain in the first place but with a septic tank\nI like actually with all drank septic or city sewer\nMechanical drained planning really is better I guess for the environment and in general than chemicals if you want to use a drink leaning chemical of course I've talked before about\nUh the uh plumbers acid ... acid works really really well to unplug a drains and traps and a drain of course is the opposite chemically of the plumbers as if you can use drain also so\nUh works pretty well mechanical drain cleaning it's a big deal to keep those dreams nice and clean and you have less or gas smell in your house in the first place thrill three seven one three\nEight to five five will be back that's got a question about hot water circulation talk about\nRight [noise] right here around the house\nAnd I played the wrong team in Tony scratching his head wondering what that's all\nAbout so let's try this\n[noise] joined ...\nHeavy Saturday at eight thirty for the senior living today show show about seniors for seniors and move them on the love them they'll cover topics relating to how\nIndependent and overall wellbeing of seniors right here in southern Colorado\nIn your living today is ... ... and other ... senior living today show with David Brenner late Saturday morning said he only here on the top five nine ...\n[noise] over two hundred and sixty years later with a little resource\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy\nEnsuring Americans have the energy they need whenever\nWe can reduce the number of opioid prescribed after surgery [noise] I just ten percent [noise]\nIt was almost three hundred and\nFewer leftover pills available each year for potential for her and she has\nThese prescription painkillers are not are only option for treating pain [noise] especially after surgery to learn more visit planned against ... dot com\n[noise]\nAnd screen and filter area and the bottom of a dishwasher I think twice a year so you might tell your friends that you talk to me and and I do mine about every six months because it's ... it really is gross you you want to put on rubber gloves it's black\nAnd just left just awful and I needed\nRotting it's gotta be riding said\nWell it is it's just yeah food residue a and you know in the summertime\nUh this summer I don't know this is the first time this summer or my dishwasher started the one that was the cycle was done my dishes smells funny they smelled sort of had a kind of a fishy odor\nTo him and I was grossed out by it and so I took the ... the spray arm off and all those filters and covers underneath and it was a pretty dirty under there are so ah I built up much quicker than I thought it was going to do so yeah you got to clean out often you're absolutely right so I Do I see here OK\nOkay twice a year thanks so much\nYou got it good to hear from you know if yeah is it it it is a function of course of oh often you do your dishes the more often you know I Do mine uh I live by myself so I Do run my dishwasher but once a week\nAnd I know many of you with larger families run years two or three times a week and then more often you run it the less of these issues you're going to have because the the the the the crowds and the bottom of the dishwasher won't get a chance to harden a and be more resistant to uh to moving through there so\nUh partly my fault there are by the way there are a dishwasher cleaners do help there is one\nIs a dishwasher magic there's there's one it's a little plastic bottle you screw the cap you and it has a little wax seal and then you turn it upside down in the dishwasher and then run a cycle and the wax plug melts and releases all the liquid them in all that so you might try a dishwasher magic and I think that's the name\nUh every uh every few months but got to clean that dishwasher yeah that's a big deal because you just get a lot of gross stuff under there and of course of between dishwashing there's you know the water's kind of warm and you'd get bacterial growth down there which you don't want or don't want either so\nCheap that clean if your dishes clean and ah and if you have you know kind of film and other dish washing your shoes that they don't seem to be as clean as they used to that may be the problem thrill three seven one three eight to five five we'll be right back\n[noise] ...\nMaking a murderer became led the TV show of force of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal\nJustice it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan gassy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to overeat budding a murder mounting a\nMurderer is now on the ... hour radiolab just open the up and\nThey found directly from live radio kept him out of the week I had ... I had radio I'll act that way you kind of limited and you think ... [noise]\nHear the news about it with him is a red line for us Sean Hannity weekday afternoon from one to four\nYou talk five Ninety ACS Jay Z fifty nine Nineteen Denver stuck station six thirty Kay how\nGot a big problem for your house can moon can help until three ... three seven on three ... three oh three seven on three eight to five five more rights twenty five minutes before the hour we're going to have you with us ...\nOne three eight to five five I guess the guy just said that but I said it again or some people say I give the phone number too fast so I Try to save as often as I can and\nSlower than I may be a would normally do it just to make sure you get it it's um a phone number seven to one three talk on your telephone do we'd love to hear from you this morning give us a call in the meantime\nGary sent me an email is an expansion tank on his water heater and and it's on the wrong side is on the uh\nHot water aside not cold supply line is it important to get this corrected I've never seen an expansion tank on a hot water side I think the cold water aside because you're trying to\nUh ... you're you're trying to accommodate expansion in the entire system not just the hot water side so I Would switch it to the cold water line just before the water here but those if you don't may not have one in your house they're becoming more and more common and expansion tank is a great idea\nOr if in at your house and I would have a strongly recommend you get one if you don't have one it's a little one gallon tank where the rubber bladder in it there's water on one side an air on the other and as the water heater he's of course the water expands as it heats in ads extra pressure to the system\nWhich means that you can develop little leaks here and there that you normally would not occur and so the expansion tanker rubber bladder moved back and forth a little bit to absorb that expansion when the water heater ticks on most\nNew home builders put an expansion taken you can add one very easily\nAs I said it goes on the cold water line just before\nThe water heater and uh you should changers theory for a for sure let's see um what what oh here's one from my friend Paul up in Wyoming I we're talking about that ought to assert pump to get hot water more quickly or to far away parts of the house\n[noise] uh let's see this is from ... from Paul I have here we go I've had an auto search for Twenty years on her kitchen sink the auto temperature timer didn't really get the job done it wasn't hot only needed it so installed a Fifteen minute timer on the moon need hot water\nReturn on the timer for five minutes so we have a hot water with much less the way much less waste will\nThank you for that poll I that's the first\nComplaint I've heard like that about the auto Sirte but nevertheless people you know there are a little pricey but they're easy to install yourself you don't\nIn most cases have to go out and hire a plumber if you don't want to the ... bridge across the hot and cold water lines there was a a statistic I saw ... years ago\nThat the average family waste about fourteen or Fifteen thousand gallons of water a year waiting for a hot water to come to a far away fixture a and some people have called here and said they\nThey collect that water or not all of it but a lot of it to water their house plants which is a\nA pretty good idea but when you want to go to work in the morning you're in a hurry you're running late you don't have time to do that so getting hot water to far away fixture I think is important in these little bumps or a pretty good idea now listen if you have an unfinished basement or across space where you have access underneath the house\nThe most efficient way to do this and I see this in custom\nHomes is very very common in the in expensive custom homes to have a third pipe you have the hot water and the cold water and a third re circulating pipe that runs back into the water heater so again you can set up this conviction loop\nOr without any of the side effects of having lukewarm cold water as we talked about if you have access underneath your house you could put a third by all the way from the water heater use that plastic ... by if you want all the way from the water heater to the far away bathroom\nAnd there you go you've you've got a third pipe for the actual re circulating itself and you'll have almost instant hot water twenty four hours a day does waste a little energy but it doesn't waste water so there's your trade off John in\nCheyenne listening on occasion it'd be good morning John Hi\nHey Ken how are you\nAll rights or what's going on\nUm my wife and I had a Cape Cod style house here and we were anything the upstairs we put into that we got a re circulating on uh-huh it's on top of the water heater\nWe in the water heater closet and then it re circulate up the second floor bathroom\nRight and instead of using that time or what I did all everything was open is that ran a a wire down for the outlet so when you go in the bathroom you switch on and it's dark five minutes later he got hot water\nAh okay so you you turn years on and off manually did you get John did you put a third pipe in\nI I Can't because I Would have had tried as the one we had a house bill water lines are just it attacks type was ran up to the second floor ready yet I Would have had it like here's a track\nIf you're going to use the bathroom and you don't want the warm water I discovered this by accident but at work when you turn to pump off if you just use the toilet one time it'll clear any warm water and that\nIt will suddenly water back up to the bathroom yeah Adam\nI got I got it at home depot the talk\nYeah with everything including the the actual line to tie everything together the one way now and the company also lets you if you call them you can order it it we can put a second in St Garnett per se or you have a rational water heaters in the middle\nAnd you've got a shower at one end and the kitchen at the other way you can have it on ... and it'll bring the hot water\n[laughter] do you remember what you paid for it uh it was right around two hundred and ... yeah that's what I thought\nBut they're required by government rules to pay retail and that's not fair it's not fair to your neighbors who are retail rate payers for you to get a retail kickback instead of wholesale\nAnd of course the subsidies for solar panels there big huge subsidies at your neighbors have to pay in the form of taxes or higher rates on their electric bill so the question is why should your neighbors pay for your solar panels when the whole scheme is simply a scheme to um\nTo pretend to make the earth greener\nTo be a to have the moral high ground in terms of of carbon\nAnd all that garbage to me it's it's it's just the way it's it's preening but not economically let alone thermal dynamically feasible or does\nHerbal fossil fuels because of all the fracking are very very low priced and now that we have mostly natural gas from fracking that's much lower in terms of you know in terms of its effect\nOn the environment and so on and so I I just I just don't think it's a good deal I Would pass this by solar uh it does not stand on its own\nAll the subsidies are huge for solar and wind there are some cities of course I Know you are going to be thinking that you're thinking that right now for fossil fuels what they are very very low compared to the ... for a megawatt subsidies for solar and wind\nWe have lots of fossil fuels we're discovering more every day I think it's time to put solar and wind on their own if they're going to make it let them make it on their own uh and getting rid of all these huge subsidies\nFor the solar and wind industry and let let things rise and fall and stand on their own if they will if they want\nThen there were just need to pass them by so I Would not do the Susan I don't think it's a good deal economically for your for your family if you want solar panels I Would go out and price them and buy them and put them on and have your own solar system installed and looked at the end of it but\nI don't know where the low cost of fossil fuels I'm not sure it's a good deal for you in the first place thrilled three seven one street eight to five five you have some feedback on that I'd love it if you'd call in here because uh we can kick that around or anything else is on your mind where to take one more break up before the top of the day\nBefore the top of the hour by the way\nJohn ... next week ten o'clock hour I Know you'll\nBe here we always enjoy John's appearances we'll be right back right here\n\n... [noise] that's why there's around the house with Ken\nGot an email here from John ah he's got a little frustrating situation going on that I'd hear from time to time and have had the same thing in my life as a a a bath fan a kind of a generic bath fan a and he's having a hard time matching it up\nTo replace the motor is quit working and a ... wants to know what to do is the vision and having to rip out sheet rock so we can get to the fan and pull the fan down in unhook it and get a new fan their wealth\nOr not so fast or John because I've been through this myself you can usually get a a new motor for almost any bath fan because they are generic replacements\nIt's not a big deal of course you turn the fan off and then you are an screw or pop off there is a grill cover on the ceiling\nFor your bath fan or in and set that aside and they'll the motor we'll be right there with two or three screws Philip screws you just on a do it the motor will drop down into your an typically you have to unplug the wires from the from the fans frame itself\nAnd then there it is in your hand that little motor or with the fan blades on it and you just simply\nA call ... down to a heating supply company you know these this is not a heating\nContractor these are companies there's a company in Denver called Charles ...

Bennett Aurora good morning how are you been\nGood can um you know maybe I have in mind this restaurant tour product religiously and yesterday I got a surprise and that will make a winter either you know that\nI did know that Yes sir\nWell maybe I didn't messing it uh but I was that low I was really surprised to see it\nNo I didn't know that I haven't used it and the reason is better and it's it's it's something I probably should pay more attention to I just go by four or five six bags of ritual on at a time and just keep them in the garage\nAnd just use them until the end but the winter rise or I'm not you know I Need to ask John that next week is there a little different formulation from the regular fertilizer I'm not sure\nYeah compared to ... bags and there is a difference\nAnd do you remember all is is maybe the uh maybe the less nitrogen and more of the of the phosphorus perhaps I I'm not sure that\nYeah yeah I just wanted to add that on your can I appreciate you're doing that yeah thank you been having safety\nYou to you too thank you for that feedback yeah I should probably be more attention to it also and by the winter riser formulation I'm sure it has\nNitrogen to encourage less leaf or a growth more phosphorus to encourage more uh you know a deeper in a better root system to encourage that\nBut it is a ... you know right about now would be as bad as late as you want to get\nIn doing your last fertilizing of the season so it's going to be a nice weekend if you're going to do it at all I Would sure do it this weekend to get it over with and then do kind of a deep watering to get that fertilizer down deep into your lawn roots and your lawn trust me\nWell thank you next spring you'll have much less winter burn a and the your lawn will just look healthier quicker or in the spring that you know that a winter burn is\nIt it's just you know it was with us\nSeems every year that we have these dry winters and so you want to make sure your winter watering end your winter is Asian fertilizing has done a right now so you can avoid that if you can [noise]\nLet's see this is from well let me see let me get back to the right page you're okay this is from Arnold we had a skylight league during a recent rains now we have about a four by twelve mold area on the ceiling should I be concerned about\nAbout this yeah you should be concerned but not panicked about it as long as it's completely dried out and the sheet rock is intact we don't want sagging sheet rock we want sheet rock that feels dry as long as it's totally dry it out you can covered in seal it\nUh basically we treat mold on the surface of regardless of where it is in the house with a little Clorox in\nWater like one part Clorox the three parts of water and uh and just put it on you know you don't want to overdo it because you don't want to get the sheet rock to wet but just disinfect the area a with a with a sponge or re just to kill that mold and once it's done you you're steal it with a primer\nAnd ah and then re pain and ... you know the the proof of the pudding or the test for this is does the mold come back again and chances are it won't you know if if if we were doing this a radio show down in the\nDown south somewhere Louisiana and Mississippi or someplace we would treat mold differently because the Ambien humidity is so high down there that mold thrives and encouraged to grow but\nHere it's so dry that once you kill it and seal it it tends to behave itself and\nA and B pretty stable so yeah you want to a ... a little bit with just a little bit not a lot of don't so the sheet rock to kill the mold spray on some been a bull's eye one two three or\nOr the kills you know a couple of coast because that's a as a ... component will steal the mold away from the indoor air environment and it will seal the organic components so that the paint a won't it won't bleed through a when you re paint the surface\nSo two or three coats of of a primer cedar lake hills once that's dry a put on some\nPaint to match the existing finished and you should be okay as long as the as the leak didn't ... you know the the worst case here would be you had a skylight leak that went on and on and on for several months\nAnd so the insulation up in the attic and and so the uh the sheet rock a totally through where it was sagging and needs to be replaced but a little mold stain is not a big deal if you get right to it so you\nFix the skylight seal the mold and you can and and as I say the the test or the proof of you having done the right thing would be just the ... leak through or ... you know bleed through again\nAnd if that's the case you need to need to retreat at but generally mold can be killed and sealed and repeated a and it will go away pretty much

the box that that long became analysts citing and including the bottom and basically got water and air and the bottom of that theme structure is thought\nOh boy yeah that's boxing that in as a mistake because of traps moisture in there you're right it would have been better to have it out in the open sewers could breeze um yeah you you probably need to replace them you need to put some temporary

specific link you see what I'm saying that you had sister if you put the new beam inside the old one and cut each Joyce offered that would be such a hassle to cut those off yeah so uh describe now if you ... if you rip starting off in throwing it away\nUm while the bottom part I had yeah that's\nI Would want to know if you could say you can stick like a pocket knife in that beam\nRight so how how far should I be able to stick and at the ...\nWell if it's just surface of rotting moisture you know if you go in a quarter of an inch and a half an inch\nThat's not as bad as it goes all the way up you know two or three inches I think you got to get that done yeah particularly a second storey deck where a if there's a if if there's a failure it can really be a catastrophe for injuries and so on
