listen if you put if you put top soil or on the on the yard this summer you said you brought in a stop so hopefully with some organic Senate why not just put this out over what you have right now\nThis is just strictly at topsoil I don't think it has that much what you feel better to it yeah well I think she could shape when they were in there and kind of work and then with a lake\nOr something like that but if they're younger and younger\nYou like you'd normally fertilizer yard with Clinton and when he or she meant shy of that one too I thought\nWell I think as I remember and you can check with Assad company but they fertilize quite often those sawed farms and so there may be a a fertilizer might have been applied to the side that you're going to get\nRelatively a relatively recently so I Would let them worry about the fertilizing if you wanted to work in some organic now like some peat moss or compost or\nA sheep and Pete uh it's okay it's a little\nCan be a little hot sometimes you can as you say do it with a rake but I wouldn't worry about fertilizing I Would just put the side down for now and uh you're you're getting kind of late in the game here have you talk to Assad company about doing this\nSo cutting telling Freeh\nYes so I mean if you wanted to work in some organics now before they come find that I wouldn't worry about fertilizing I just put it down and I'd water it and and let it go with that yeah\nWell thank you so much\nYou got to hear from you thanks for thanks for calling\nSo yeah I mean I ... you can sometimes people can fertilized too much fertilizing of course in a new lawyer newly seated long can be a problematic because it can be fairly harsh so but the side company worried about that they will fertilized\nA timely enough or maybe a week or two before they cut the side and it'll be\nIt'll be fine so you know get that in and hopefully you'll get a\nWet snow or two which is perfect for a new lawn and get it off to a good start

I don't know I mean I I don't know a state law that would require a newer home like yours built in the Nineteen nineties to have a ... testing so now you've got to repair the damage that they did some of these folks just need to bone up on things like\nLike housing dates and eras of what what was used when you know from the seventies and the earlier lead paint was very common\nAs was his best isn't drywall taping products them and even in the texture products and so you have to kind of be careful if you're in an older home when you remodel you want to make sure you keep things damp\nAnd uh if you're going to scrape off any drywall material like acoustic ceiling which I don't recommend by the way that's another that's another topic but if you're going to have any drywall products in a house

o'clock thrill three seven one's three Haiti's Bye bye Jo in Colorado Springs listening on the already Oh hi Joe you're on the air good morning\nOr anything you can end of this month a professional is going to blow up the external underground sprinklers and dreaming inside sprinkler quite\nWhat should I use to insulate the outside above ground exposed quite which breastfeeding any pressure valve\nWell nothing if he's going to drain the water out of both ends of the system than those pipes won't have any water in them\nA because virtually all sprinkler systems are set up to have a drain on the inside in the utility room of some kind and one on the outside of that sprinkler manifold box and so he when he opens both of those uh Joe it it'll let area in both ends of the pipe\nIn that water all dribble out you're going to be fine Yeah Yup okay now now is he going to blow your system out\nYeah I've got a it's a it's a great I'm Glad you called because it's a great segue I was going to spend\nFive minutes or so here talking about uh the my views on blowing out sprinkler system so you can hang up and uh and listen to that but uh in your particular concern to your question a there'll be no water in the pipe anyway OK\nOkay thank you\nGood glad you called thrill three seven won three to five five by the way I Want to reset the show where the fall um show sustainability expo in the springs a power parking academy we open attempt today tend to six\nEleven deal for tomorrow by the way insulation it's interesting show you asked that question insulation only works if there's heat on one side and cold on the other so if you just simply wrap your sprinkler place with insulation\nA buy themselves out there in the in in the air than the cold weather comes the insulation and the pipes will uh both get cold so the insulation is only good if there's warm temperatures um on one side so that you can retain those warmer temperatures so I wouldn't enslaved the pipes anyway\nMy view on blowing out sprinkler system as I said we don't we talk about this every year is it in most cases it's not necessary modern sprinkler systems\nAre piped with that shiny black polyethylene of the sprinkler pipe the uh out in the yards the zone valves feeding all the various heads in the yard and they are fairly forgiving of cold temperatures I haven't blown up my sprinkler system in decades and I'm I'm been just fine the pipes that do freeze\nOr the exact pipes that Joel was asking about those manifold pipes on the outside of the house they're usually copper or maybe white PVC or both\nAnd they're hard stiff pipes that crack a at a moment's notice when the water expands upon freezing\nDown to it when we get to about twenty seven Fahrenheit or below is when you really have to really have to worry so I'm not a I I just don't think blowing out a sprinkler system is\nA has a good return on investment so to speak and I don't think it's desirable and I don't think it's helpful because you do need that went through water we have we've been having drive\nA relatively dry warm winter's\nOver the last several years and\nWe just uh which we just\nDon't need\nTo drag hoses around but we do need the water every three weeks or so you have to water the law in the bushes the the the bulbs under the under your garden and so I think it's a good idea to to winter arises sprinkler system but that's different from blowing it out by one to rising I mean protecting\nThe pipes that are are most vulnerable the copper and PVC pipes are that are on the side of your house and you can do that quite easily by opening the the valves\nOr by turning the water off first of all through the whole system of course and then opening the drain valves in the house and uh on the uh outside of the house in that sprinkler box once you open both of those\nLittle faucets or drains we let air and both ends atmospheric pressure the water dribbles out and we're fine\nI'll tell you what a winter water and if we have no precipitation you simply reverse the process on a nice warm day turn the sprinkler system back on and do your winter watering and then turn it off in the ... winter rises again so\nIn most cases I don't think we need to blow out the sprinkler system because then you don't get an opportunity to water water all\n... for the next six months or so\nBut in the meantime if you'd you know if you see the lawns extra dry you have to drag hoses around you have to separately water your flower gardens and young trees and Bush's other flower gardens that most homes have\nBulbs that are wondering the Irish plants and tulips and daffodils and so on they needed a drink of water also as do rose bushes a on a in a in a dry winter so I'm not a big fan of going out a sprinkler system unless it's an old fashioned system where all the pipes out in the yard are steel or PBC or maybe\nA in an extreme cases copper but if there's just normal polyethylene plastic\nBush that black shiny sprinkler pipe just let it go don't blow it out but winter rise the vulnerable pipes on the side of your house if you have some comments on that we'd love to hear from you some feedback thrill three seven one three eight to five five is our contact line and a live email this morning at a rally\nI was wondering you have anybody you recommend around my area that get to work and what they are the metal duct work back up in their\n... listens there's nothing wrong with flex duct work if it's insulated uh it\nThat it's not insulated that\nYeah well a\nPlastic then at the end matter of fact that it had a few old then at night I had to go up at all I was wondering why my house with an eight hundred or a little a eight hundred and fifty square foot house and sometimes my winter gas bills over two hundred dollars a month and it's ...\nListen in most places it's not legal to use non insulated duct in the attic by the based on the energy codes that are available so he did not do you any service I Would um I Would not go back to the metal ...\nOr ... I was gonna ask you a question I Would not go back to the metal duck thing I Would uh have someone come and put insulated flex duck thing in the addict because the labor costs will be a lot less so they called us it's usually black and shiny black\nA plastic covering it insulated and then there's a flex interior metal flex interior\nFor so I just simply have them replace the non insulated flex with insulated flex and I think you're going to be fine so I appreciate your call in the spring will start to Gary good morning Jerry you're on the air I\nMean good morning\nHave a simple question about re as light switches yes uh I had the touch type and I also had a slight type as both types are getting worse\nOh hot to replace the one that was again hot but it's still in\nWell war okay my view on these is it warm as okay hot is not and you you need to check the water Jews of the total number of watts of the light bulbs in the circus and compare him to the waters of the Denver itself\nSo warm is fine I'm One of the ways that you could help radiates the heat is to buy metal switch covers instead of plastic\nOr you can buy a ivory colored or white or whatever color you have in a in metal I think it's aluminum\nI'm not sure about that but his metal so it will help get rid of that he so warm find hot not fine check the waters and you don't want to be within about eighty percent of the waters in other words\nIf you're if you're ... Denver\nDon't get any more than a what eighty of of six is a four hundred and eighty stay stable that eighty percent value or go to the next hire them or\nWater which uh because that's usually the problem with these when they get hot you have too many light bulbs and its overloading the Denver but get medals which place again warm okay hot and not okay I Hope that helps you Gary we'll be right back up the sustainability exploiting the springs we open at about five\nMinutes here at Palmer park an academy in Colorado Springs event center [noise]\nDamn apparel and being and play on the U.S having to use your money where the miracles are\nGive to your children's you're on that one\nNinety case yes for the call home showing the springs fire work at a gathering of the events that are interesting bills we open them in a\nForeign minister so in the meantime let's go to Ron in Gillette, Wyoming Ron good morning you're on the air Hi\nGood morning a real quick question here around my property I've noticed I have acquired\nThrough Europe for a large piles about the size of the Bush will basket and our little boy I tried to decide how to get rid of them I thought about four years he already shutting fire but at the fires bridge there certainly are [laughter]\nYeah no I Would uh you know that we're getting to the weather now where they're going to become sort of dormant anyway and um so what I Would uh I'd probably let things go you know for another week or two and then just get a shovel and spread of mountains and just get some some grocery store and killer\nTo spray or on whatever you know there's ... eggs in there and so on that just um you know once you spread 'em out and spray that poison on their list that set all winter up I don't think there'll be coming back so I Would probably not disturb them right now okay\nTill it gets a little cooler\nYeah and it's just spread of mountain boys and um and I think the I don't think they'll come back okay hey have a great day\nYou to appreciate it bill in Lakewood good morning you're on the air got about a minute and a half or so yeah\nWhat the heck is is there any way to eliminate you know when you turn the furnace on for the first time yeah at that older I I assume if the settling on the burn is something\nI don't think so unless you want to get in there before you fired up with your shop back and got a vacuum everything that you could see it get to a but no that's you know it's insect maybe there's some spider webs in there and who knows how to get in there and so and yeah\nAnd one room I have two twenty base bought heat is and then they do the same thing\nAnd it it's it's you get the same thing with gas a log fire places you know they said all winter getting full of ... and flies but who knows dust and so on\nSo you can't really help there yeah but again you got your shot back in ... poked around inside your furnace there'll be less of that I suppose huh so okay hey well thank you that's all right Bill thanks for your call bills or regular color and that's great to the program villain liquid\nUh so yeah that's it just comes with\nWinter on the way my furnace has already starting up I have a great Honeywell thermostat that's on the auto setting so goes the heat or cool whatever whatever's needed and my friend has already started I'm sure yours has also\nReminder of the get it clean makes sure is nice and clean\nFor and checked out and safety check for the coming winter heating season well\nThe doors are opening now at the Colorado Springs events that are ... to get to the rest of the kills we'd love to see what the ... the inability sustainability and outdoor living expo rope until they until six tomorrow eleven before we back after after the news with our number two around the house give us go I'm\n\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens\nWhen you called select quote life for example Georgia's forty\nHe was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select what age and dance to be you know and believe me\nIf the liquid isn't shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nFor your free quote cult eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty to last eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty to eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty two or go to select ... since Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy it slowed down complex commercials or price could vary depending on your health insurance company in fact I don't remember when I was\nFive K. C. S. J. lo\nFive Ninety eight feet on your phone are you\nI'm Pam who sounds Fox News from the Supreme Court to Capitol Hill thousands of people are protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh hours before the Senate holds a final vote on his confirmation knock this year we can Turner is outside the high court\nIt would shut down the fuel supply and I don't think that's a good idea but that was the case the state senator voted for the bill and he says his house froze up because there was a false reading of carbon monoxide turned the furnace off\nSo it's funny how perspective change that would I Would that be in favor of that\nAh for reasons you describe it gets cold in Wyoming that it gets cold around here and I so I Would a carbon monoxide detector that has allowed alarm to wake you up and get you out of the house to call the fire department would be that the deal I Would not want one that was shut the fuel supply off with one exception\nThere are propane alarms if you're out in the country and a half\nPropane to fuel supply propane pretty dangerous insidious because this much heavier than natural gas tends to sink to the lowest places in the house like that\nCause space in the basement or if you get a propane alarm you can wire that into a valve\nThat will shut off the fuel supply to your house so if the detects if the sniffer smells propane fumes it turns off the gas supply which I think that's a good idea otherwise\nCarbon monoxide detector set up in the hallway sniff the air and if they sense carbon monoxide over a given period of time they will alarm\nSo I think that's a wonderful idea so somebody if somebody knows the exact current law in Wyoming about requirements for use and new homes that have carbon monoxide alarms give us a call three ... three seven one three to five five in the meantime in Montana\nOr going to talk to Jeff\nGood morning Jeff you're on the air Hi\nGood morning Ken I'm\nRehab temperatures up here I live about probably less than a hundred miles south of here as the crow flies huh um\nAnd so what are rising is pretty much after the up here but as I did research on that\nI found out that you have to be careful when you're when arising because I did not realize this but the plastics that are kind of rotate your driven mechanisms you are uh-huh or that they're actually\nCool by the water that goes through the plastic it's cooled and if you're a nose for any sense of period of time without water you actually run the risk of developing though they're not causing damage to your uh your sprinkler heads\nSo yeah I Know some folks like they get every last little bit of water out of there but uh you run the risk if you do that a actually a damaging your ...\nAnd you are reminding me thank you Jeff for your call because you reminded me of of the little tagline about winter rising sprinklers are not blowing them out a and I\nForgot to do this I'll do it now is it when I Do mine I I go to the my sprinkler control clock you know the little control system and I cycled through each\nHis own valve for about ten seconds each which relaxes the there's kind of a ... big rubber diaphragm or a washer inside it relaxes it and let's air into that valve and then I turn the clock off you the same idea if you don't want to leave your sprinkler clock on with no water because those valves\nAre electric and they have a ... and they do tend to over here so that's a good reminder yeah\nYup or do you know you're you're up in the cold country up there do you take it you don't blow out your sprinkler systems that what you're saying\nNo we do if you're if you're going out myself but one of the things that you're that another cycle a couple of times um the cool weather here so let us much of the water out as possible or when I bought I have less water to actually get out\nAnd it's it's amazing really how much of the water goes gets out all by itself without me having to do anything\nYeah I think there's some dribbling through a connections and vows and there's also some evaporation that occurs and so yeah I ... my theory is and I think this is such a kind of validated by the fact that they don't freeze is that uh if you were the rise your system\nAh and you know here in the next couple of two or three weeks\nA and then don't turn it on for a month or so to winter water in the meantime a lot of evaporation and will take place in a little bit of leaking so those pipes are less than half full of water enemy that's that and the fact that there are plastic is why they don't freeze because we're not totally full of water yeah\nRight I Am going to tend to any surfing is going to turn the water levels tend to go down to the lowest sprinkler head anyway so yeah I'm not saying they're going to drain anything for higher or so yeah it's a it's\nA pair of self and a lot of areas you know I when I Lived in Colorado Springs I that's what I uh\nI I followed your advice there up here I'm a little more reluctant to do that because the coke goes but\nYeah you and your ground freezes all your ground probably freezes all winter long doesn't it\nPretty much pretty much from the city is maybe not so much a food and that's the other thing is we are part of the Pacific northwest up here in West Montana and uh and so we don't get as much as Colorado ...\nYup
