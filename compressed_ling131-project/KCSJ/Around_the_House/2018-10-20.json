Fox News that I Am now that are ... has confirmed that journalists democracy Shelby was well heeled inside its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey ... is this playing reaction\nWord resident Trump says he thinks it's out and get a good first people that was an arrest you think some people that they allege freaked out and\nYeah I a friend of mine was buy a house and and the\nFactor or something they said they're all they kept playing them I mean I mean they had to have it all replace be several thousand dollars but then that another person said they had it in their house and now they were wandering gosh should I take all that out on about Twenty years old\nI read into it I'm sure you're familiar with it [noise] it really that you have to take that\nThat's a bad is it the Polly beautifully and you're talking about\nNo Petra ethylene\nYou know I'm not I'm not sure what that is a great it's great well the ... you know I'll go back ... poly doodling is gray and that's the stuff that we replace all the time it was maybe you might be right maybe I think it is ... and\nIt's it's a pipe that was with us from the late seventies till about the mid nineties your right to a twenty year old house it would be kind of unusual\nThat late to have this stuff well here's the deal is ... it was the first plastic water pipe and it was touted as\nJust the best thing since ice cream you know and we both thousands of homes in many many condos in an apartment buildings and ... and what we found is that the fittings\nWhere there's a tea or an hour would deteriorate from the chlorine in the oxygen in the water and they would react chemical and splitting the cause catastrophic flooding well there were a class action lawsuits to beat the band back in the nineties yeah uh the shell oil company which invented it was part of the one of the defendants and there were a bunch of others\nThose class action suits are gone now but to answer your question ... poly beautifully and has a lousy reputation with realtors appraisers home inspectors so if you've got it in your house it's probably a good idea to get a change\nFor me I had said also the insurance companies if they know you have it they will not sure you're out\nYou know I think that's true I'm not sure it applies to all homeowners insurance companies but that that like aluminum wiring I think that's one of the questions that many of these companies will ask and I think you're right because there can be you know it ages poorly and it doesn't get better doesn't stabilized and so the\nTheory is it'll eventually all of these houses will eventually flood and so it needs to be changed there are all kinds of companies around who have turned key operations that is the plumbers painters dry waters on\nOn staff so they just come in and usually in one day maybe a day and a half they cut slots in the drywall him in and replace all the plumbing or would not with copper but we used ...

have any idea what's going on other than you could do a little experiment a at it and you could close off a start closing this isn't your bedroom level right so start closing off all the other ducts of their temporarily\nAnd turn that are in the sun and see if we can force a little air uh through their um the only thing I can think of Steve is that you have somewhere in that line is it do you think there's a flex ducked instead of hard metal or is it all hard sheet metal\n... it'd be hard at all um yeah I mean there's\nNo now flex stacking comes straight out of out of the ad a furnace\nThat set them that big box called upon them was 'cause I reason I ask 'cause sometimes those flex ducts can get a kink in him or collapse or something well I don't know this is a mystery but uh again try the experiment don't do it too long you don't want overload the furnace but\nBut blocked off a bunch of other ducks and see if it'll force air into that into your master bedroom ducked

coming around the house good morning\nCan't I have two questions ... of the country just\nBefore the free and and note in October to second what I did I didn't have time to blow up my spank him so I just trying to pipe quite went outside to the men of ... and so the backup path that I wouldn't trade and now when I come home after\nBeing gone for Fifteen days I'm assuming that just barely crack it in the water on the refrigerator things I could have Erin or something because it get it we'll go to another\nFacet and turn it on and take it away\n[noise] why I don't know is there is is a squeal only with the ice maker\nNo no it's with any faucet for us who just slightly crack open it'll start squealing\nYeah I don't know if that's related to the sprinkler system or not ah I just don't know um there was this a new sound you haven't had before right\nOh no every time it seems like a drain down the uh the sprinkler system it seemed like it that happen\nHuh boy that's a new one for me I Would want to know one one of those things are always asking\nQuestions like similar to yours where there's noises random noises in plumbing systems is what the what your water pressure in your house or is it a too high to do that would be a symptom of too high a water pressure by the way you say it happens every time does it eventually go away\nYeah yeah yeah well\nI don't know if there's a relationship there and I suppose there could be we we wouldn't want to go back to the water or whatever the common elements are the the common elements to your sprinkler and the house plumbing which would be the water meter the pressure regulator yeah I'm not sure one thing you could try to do is the old stuff the scope test\nIs to get you can actually buy a cheap medical on line for twenty five or thirty bucks or you could use the blunt end of a screwdriver in your ear and I knew about that\nAnd just when the ... going on touch different parts of the plumbing systems starting in the utility room and see maybe it's the water meter howling or maybe it's the pressure regular but you can kind of isolated that way that's the best advice I can give you you said you had another incident\nThe second one that I have a circulation pump at one of those a lot about with a\nTimer on the hot water heater yeah I never knew what that for\nOh well that's easy it's to circulate to the hot water so that when you get up in the morning you had turned on your laboratory you have hot water right away without waiting\nFor it to come so you set the timer a you know Fifteen twenty minutes before you get up every morning it'll kick the pump on you'll have hot water right away could then you're not wasting water down the drain waiting for hot water you know what I'm saying\n... and save energy to right Oh absolutely yeah yeah anyway listening Brian thanks for the feed better now I'm sure I Hope she's listening that will help yeah and she can give you a call yeah right at a good way to get you to Brian thanks for your call All right Brian from eagle crushed\nThat's good advice we can do it a little experiment for a couple of days and see see that house Carl sent me an email he gets\nNeighbors user fireplace a lot and he gets a strong smell of smoke in his house and he's going to do to reduce or eliminate then and I follow through with Carl this is something I Want you all to uh to remember and think about\nUh the Carl admitted that his house I was I Can't remember when the house was built but it was in that era where we were obsessed by putting fresh air ducts into the house uh to\nUh to feed the furnace this was a result of the Arab oil boycott in the seventies where\nWe kind of panic because we started the ceiling almost overnight we started adding extra insulation extra cooking and sealing the houses and ah we ah had incidents of\nOf a carbon monoxide issues so the city code people say oh my gosh we're going to pass emergency rules and ordinances to add these fresh air ducts coming directly from the outside into the furnace system\nJust as combustion air for the furnace to make sure we have enough air\nSo the furnace and water heater can breathe well that's all well and good but these fresh air ducts in the wintertime are very cold makes the floor above cold in ads cold air to the system that really kind of waste energy a and they're just\nPeople don't like them and ... and in Carl's case\nIt's a the this sucks areas of the house into sucking\nOf films and smoke from his neighborhood ... from his neighbors fireplace so\nI told Carl to to kind of check that out\nTo ... ... talk to his HVAC contractor and see if he really needs that fresh air duct what we found over the years since all this has come and gone is that we can get enough air usually in most cases from inside the house\nSo we can eliminate these ducks altogether so we're not sucking brutally cold air into our furnace system which makes the house cooler and waste energy\nI don't want you to block these if you have one and these were\nPopular from the as I say the mid seventies or so when the Arab oil thing hit an energy prices skyrocketed we started\nUsing them then and they lasted all the way into the nineties now we don't use a ... at all I don't see them at all in the new homes because we\nDo get our air from in many cases\nInside the house so you simply put a Louvre door on the furnace room or cut some holes and put grills on them in the wall of the furnace ruin that sort of thing so you get all the volume of air this in the house circulating through the furniture for combustion era because when the furnace and water heater run they suck up oxygen when they\nCan bust the natural gas you got to replace that\nBut we find that when people come and go the windows are open people open the garage and come in and out there's enough fresh air in the house that we can take it into the furnace room to satisfy this and then we can block up these crazy\nCold air intake ducks the nobody likes and I don't want you to do it on your own I Do see people stuff rags in them without checking with anybody this is a needed safety issue the issue and\nSystem that's in the house for good reason she can't just willy nilly block up the ducks with a wash closet old rag or something without compensating someplace else to run this by your heating contractor and chances are they can recommend delivered door or something to overcome this you can block the cold air ducts often and are not sucking\nFumes from the neighborhood and not some cold air into your house okay thrill three seven one three eight\nTo five five we'll be right back right here on around the house [noise] [noise]\nMm hair part D switching to Walgreens may help you

J.\n[noise]\nAbout five minutes before nine o'clock now let's get Christina on the line Christie good morning you're on the air coming around the house high\nOn your way of talking about eight and a question about the cold air returns uh-huh on I ... in Seventy two so most of our code to count on for a while you know put for any kind of like block\nUh-huh I like the area where a lot of is that how it got to work around at the gap where it wouldn't be blocked out what\nStyle of house do you have do you have a rancher what do you tell a\nStory yeah you you can uh it's relatively easy to take those apart and you can use the interior stood space you know between the dry\nWell it's kind of a channel to run the cold air return up to the higher level you know you can uh and that will you get kind of a cross ventilation other words the heat will come out of the floor registers and wander up to the higher the cold air returned yeah you sure can\nUh that's doable but remember you don't need a lot of room in front of those ... are crusty rather you just need a you know a couple of inches so like a sofa in front of him silver backs curve\nAway from the wall and so that's generally enough so you don't need a lot of space you know knowing that now that I've told you two or three inches can you rearrange your furniture to make them work or not really\nWell there's a little bit of faith in kind of an actual like everything furniture blocking it totally so there's probably gosh eight inches there so that that is completely open\nAir that's plenty that's okay I'm going to like\nHim is a with a two story we have a hard time like everybody does with a he or or a scene making it all the way upstairs you out of our basements breathing felt that Brian does he do that ... of the duct work and\nYou do sometimes you could bring in extra colder returns up to the upper level of a two story through the garage they run a duck straight up and into that second story is there a colder returning the upper story of your house now\nThere is there's one in my ... actually there's two there's one there right above and below each other on at the feeling on the floor\nWill have plenty of cold air return I really do I think a ... degree for Nineteen Seventy\nSeventy two house so I think you're fine when it comes to the air conditioning you're right it's hard to show that dance cold air to the upper story a couple of things we can do is a recommendations is having a ceiling fan and the upper hallway blowing downward in the summer\nTo show that hot air back down through the furnace also turning the furnace fans are always on when you get home\nFrom work and looked at thing wrong continuously all evening long that will help\nA with cooling also so it would be worse you know run to come over and see if you have enough\nA square inches or square footage of cold air returns we there's some minimum ... of the actual size of the cold air returns is sometimes we can put a bigger a bigger return in ... as he was talking you may have been listening a few minutes ago air flows everything\nThe writer we get through the furnished the better the furnace runs more efficiently and all the better cooling and heating their Russo or you might argue in the Denver metro area\nIn Littleton little to he could come by maybe a you know on a non uh emergency type basis and\nTo look at your
