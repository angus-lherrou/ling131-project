{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "With all of those marketplaces so I'm On the show here today with Andrea ... we're talking about is already a lifeline\nAnd the importance of of this particular service that's out there or southern Colorado\nWhich has been out there for a long time and how it really affects our senior so I ... thanks for coming on and sharing this with uh our listeners we we kind of need everybody to be thinking about what's going on with mom or dad\nIf something happens when no one's around\nDefinitely um and that's just that's a common issue that people don't think about these types of things that can really help seniors um stay independent and tell\nIf they're in desperate need 'em something to help because an incident has happened um and so now that they finally realized that mom or dad needs help then they're sticking these services out we want to make sure people are aware of the services before anything serious were to happen on our mom and dad is injured\nAnd and so that's why we have lifeline and me\nPromote it to the community and that's why I Do what I Do because um the the thing that everybody wants is to be as independent as possible matter what your age is and I'm\nWith the ... when you grow in Asia you you can have some issues that might lead to falls um and the major thing with the fall is that you might not be able to get up and the longer that you lay there after a fall and the where she could be injured\nAnd you know I think the scary part is is that those of us in senior care\nThat we see that it sneaks up on people oh mom is fine dads are driving around and nobody's even thinking about this until there's a fall off the porch of fall down the stairs something happens and that fall is catastrophic and changes everything mhm\nAnd so you know false are going to happen but\nI Am a real advocate of the life wide program because look it's around the neck it's it's it's it's something that\nYou have and if you fall you're not going to be wondering uh in six hours from now who's coming to visit me you know you have that immediate response and I think the sons and daughters just need to think about women think mom and dad's doing great\nBut they may have fallen and not told you and once we get into falls you know they can they can happen in series and then one day the fall is really the number one cause of why people die so ... did this is such an important topic and and this is a pretty affordable system isn't it ...\nIt definitely is and when you're considering um hospital possible hospitalizations I'm from a fallen especially laying there for a long time and\nIt's definitely something that you can be proactive with and and affordable product and that can help keep families safe and keep ... parents at home longer and independent and help the children feel more confident that mom and dad are safe at home and they don't have to worry so much because they know\nThat if they were to have a fall that um that it's just a push the button and they can get help\nAnd actually we do have a son and units that have fall detection and I'm\nSo with that technology even if somebody were to fall and hit their head and be unable to push a button and it's very accurate and get in determining a fall and will call for help and even if a button and them pushed\nSo um that's just\nThat's really great settle for under fifty bucks a month mom or dad can still live at home even though you've got concerns about that they could still live at home they can get some help on the side\nBut if that helps not there are no one's around that they do fall for under fifty bucks a month you know you're really given them that independence that they're really seeking and then after that of course you got to you know you've got to try to mitigate that for the future but\nWhat a what a great program and and and talk about the apparatus what is it is it big as it small\nUm it's not bad and and the one with the fall detection has to be one around their neck\nAnd because that's how it detects the fall we do have some buttons that can be more on on the wrist and those are mostly for people that are more and just in that in the home\nUm by themselves sometimes and aren't really going out and about um without somebody with them\nAnd but with the ones around the neck we had some that actually are on mobile devices that people can take with them anywhere and they have all detection and on and and if they were to fall if they were at the grocery store or out for a walk in the neighborhood\nAnd it would detect that fall or they can push a button and and it has GPS locating in it so that um help would be able to find them where they are\nOkay so somebody wants to this is something that you know maybe a need for my mom and dad how do I get a set of how hard is it to get it set up at mom's house\nIt's it's very easy and again you can just call the same number that you call for that the safety of senior conference that's I mean my my number it's five for five went to one kill and\nAnd just give us your name information and we will just figure out what kind of um questions that we need from asking some kind of questions to get the information that we need 'em\nTo get you all set up and our service reps are all local so that they couldn't get out there and probably the next day and get mom or dad set up and so it's a very easy simple process and to get\nDo they like to send to the phone I mean they just have to connect it right so that it uses the phone system to be able to call so as long as there is a technical person they're they come to the home when they get that all set up so mom and dad are in good shape and that's ... that's the whole deal here yeah\nThis is good so if some of you avoided this and I know people don't want that added monthly fee and\nYou know oil I think I'll pass on that I'll just holler out for the neighbor you know I've heard all sorts of stories about that and I think it's really something that you need to think about so given that phone number one more time this is lifeline that they get something that you all should consider\nIt's five for five one two one two\nThat's great well this has really been a a I think an important part of our community that is really stretch started out in Pueblo\nTwenty six years ago and they'll look at it going all the way to Durango\nAnd and as you know Colorado would have it there are a lot of really a lot of books of grannies you'll learn a little tiny towns and\nIt's really nice because that brings technology to your town that brings technology to wherever you are yeah and the whether you're in assisted living whether you're in an independent living or at home or maybe you're living with your kids I mean what a great what a great opportunity to have that extra hand in the house for under fifty bucks a month\nYes definitely so what does that number to call once more five for five one two one two great that's so easy to remember for four or five [laughter] who wants to so\nYeah we be thinking about life wind if you don't already have it I Know that they could uh probably take care of your pretty pretty quick\nYeah and I have I did want to mention that they don't even have to have a a land line at home and we also have a mobile units and even with our new go safe to button and that doesn't have to be connected to the base unit at all so under a lot of different options depending on if they still have a home phone or if they have a mobile device\nUsing technology grant and this is the thing that amazes me all the time everything changes\nWill break we're going to take a little break right now and the senior living today show and
