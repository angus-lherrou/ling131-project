profound\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser a Christina Ford\nShe was the she was the woman that was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by ... head of homeland security as the\nA sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not\nDr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year so she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also\nNot a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in ... her expertise is\nOn old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any of CNN not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should be the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court not for profit institution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and\nQuote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again\nLike she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Iraq Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's\nWon't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee vis explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly\nWhat it was now she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\n\nIf you are looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lift the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attack changed to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well\nIf you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nIn high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been\nIn the mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it gets\nBetter this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged tack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early Nineteen\nEighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nJoined in return every Saturday and eight thirty for the senior living today show the show about seniors

than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does that's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smear somebody you have to have some

um\nYou want to the only Democrats that have come out and said this is nuts gimme gimme are viewing the lay of the land from a democratic point of view from your point of view\nSure I think it's perfectly legitimate to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of differences and judicial philosophy a you know if you believe certain things that he doesn't align with those beliefs let's find that's what the Democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that rate you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head\nAnd promote these outrageous accusations against them specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick who just don't even ask the snow is I mean we're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I could kind of speak to the culture and how\nHow those communities operate I mean the thought that a group of Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school and nobody would know anything about it\nUp until now is just it's ludicrous and then that eight and a goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened the cheapest

complete door in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this is great I'm really happy\nSo the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we've abandoned a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on a matter of faith\nBased on historical pattern of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late but they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things or because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism and there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right\nIt's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but\nHe put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent\nMore than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nThey all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and let me tell you I think uh [noise]\nDr Ford who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a ... it's a series of inconsistencies\nThat would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications ah in political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence and then what you're doing now is that\nThey're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank while he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares\nBut it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like pleading Adam St Lawrence those goalpost seemed kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason um\nSo the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes then there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper right there you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right the if the guy's calendar clear is that right\nIt's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely fine that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is into court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not need any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happens four times so I think people need to cash this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play\nYou buy associate right mark judge I I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of the country has never met met right so we're just going up here see right now\nAnd based on his own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had a serious drinking issues it's not Brett ... we're we're not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut well we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud\nRight we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically that insane that's what they do in in in ... public spending third world countries that's not where we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do

Wilbur Ross says\nHow in the world can that be run by one city it's impossible I Want to allow county is to be counties and regions to be regions and people to be people and it's totally fine the issue becomes why do I want to enforce my will upon you I Want you to be as conservative or liberal as you want to be\nPeople tease me and say Larry you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you don't know what's right for me in Queens either were even\nHow do I let you be you you let me me me and we can all be free to gather\nWhat a ton of work it has word\nThat's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York where do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are a plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen at present but if it's in the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nTo does not just a Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is is that the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even come in second would shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats and Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrats they don't have to worry about small business\nDon't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties is supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened in civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive a massive culture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation\nBut something else I don't have a career to protect\nI don't have people to pay back I don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency because a problem with the government is now is they're enforcing the kings well so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and\nI don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nYou've read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know\nI Know it's I'm not sure it's an old during the day to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we sort of the way while ago\nBut yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met or individual businesses that individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs\nGrowth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community we don't do that well in New York said it all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is a capital gains decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concept one instead\nOf me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending\nHere's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that bridges named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all\nThese companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that's using the weekends I got a bridge you can name and\nThat bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area and hundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just looking at Texas New York populist the taxes you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but here's the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just to repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now in New York state collapse we don't have enough money\nThese guys do will have to have safe or bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes in New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars you know\nI don't know if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle\nYou're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge less money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we are running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is me this one cell in Texas\nHow do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already seller\nBefore the Republicans and they all kept given up I mean they don't show up or the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote vote because of fear we can't have fear but the reason why people vote it's simply the wrong answer\nMan but I Would say that in reality I'm trying to change just to make it so that people stop voting for the last of two evils and instead vote for someone\nAnd it is working I Am actually using if you notice I'm using non traditional media traditionally it does not want to cover me and polls don't wanna deal with me but not the media is working and I'm getting out there and people are seeing me they're responding to me and this is what's working the way to make this happen is through non traditional media and believe it or not\nPeople are getting it they actually like it I hear all the time people say Larry honor to be with you\nYou're saying but you actually answer questions you actually have a plan and\nThey love it and that's what I say it look my plan may be faulty maybe they will we can't leave all the bridges maybe we can't raise fifty billion maybe only rate thirty billion\nThat when you do okay tell me what that ... ... and let me ask you can I hold you over for one more break yes\nOkay a oldie over and and tell me how we fix education and higher education it's out of control its its post modernist it's indoctrinate ing and it's in leaving our children to debt when we\nCome back to Larry sharp I have to tell you if I was living in New York [noise] and I was a Republican I Can't I cannot imagine a reason\nWhy I Would not vote for him to the gym or the ... the Democrat is
