{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "Has actually partnered up with ... which is guaranteed trust is a great company it's been around for over eight years and we are offering this new short term home healthcare insurance to cover you while you're at home to cover\nA home health care home health care aide even with benefits for prescription\nCosts as well as hospitals stay um coverage\nSo ... so it's so it's a wide wide berth civil a lot of items that are put into a policy like this I'm as probably ... is this something new or that that you're that you're offering has this been out there for a long time\nNo this is actually new within the last couple of months that's new to new within our portfolio I guess you want to say\nAh there's probably a few other companies out there but knew the Humanae we've been doing this for a month you know after training and going over ... over a month and people are actually liking that\nYou know hey I get paid back for prescriptions that I'm taking\nA which most of us take at least one or so and then it's also going to cover it depends on what you look at and how much you want and you kinda can build your own kind of like a ... you know happy Miller I'm sure my way like that and what this or that\nSo you can put in the hospital stay it comes with the basic short term healthcare you can add pieces to it to help cover your gaps in your insurance coverage\nOkay good so it's very customized bullet cells like and that's kind of what is that where a lot of products are going in the future to to give people better choices in their seem it seems to be complicated so this kind of fills those holes right\nRight it does it does cover that gap thing care but it also like Shawn said a lot of us are taking medication this policy is actually for any one forty years old and older not just the sixty five Medicare people\nSo ah this this covers some co pays for you and and a lot of us that take medication every day we're all paying a copay almost every month\nIn the big picture um are the changes from Obamacare a there's a lot of high level stuff\nOut there and maybe we don't even want to go down that road because I I think none of us really know and maybe you don't either all where this is all going and so you know a lot of times you're just trying to to to to provide products that really meet the needs of the of the clients white here in southern Colorado\nThat that that need so yeah we'll avoid that subject but I think\nYou know where where it's all going I'm sure you we all scratch our heads and and maybe you know he met is no different you try to you know to continue on this track 'em in the time that we have I Do want to talk about some of the supplements and Medicare and I must admit I'm One of those that I don't know a lot about it\nBut the the Medicare ... supplements I think are valuable ... can you wonder if you explain that to where we position is in our families and our futures [laughter]\nSo that's where we as agents branding I go in and we make sure so the first thing is what you know like I said before what keeps you up at night while I'm worried about hospitals I'm worried about these so we'll do that needs analysis so supplemental are what they are\nYour Medicare is going to pay first or even your individual and then you're supplemental insurance is going to come in and pay what's leftover or depend on the plan what small co pays you may have or out of pocket you may have\nUm [noise] you'd does range from there's got from a through and\nSo those are quite a few out there that you can kind of look at it and very they're very him priced too so\nYou may be paying your Medicare premium plus you have to pay that supplemental premium and that's where a lot of families may not be able to afford that bigger premium so then at that point that's where we go okay well let's look at this other option\nMay be Medicare Advantage and I think brandy can cover Medicare Advantage a little bit more of that said\nYeah and with with the supplements to you also have to have a prescription drug plan a lotta people that we run into they were like why do we even I don't take medication I don't want him a prescription drug plan\nA lot of people don't realize that Medicare penalize if you if you did not get a prescription drug plan when your Medicare start and that penalty goes for life so it's kinda scary to think about but that's where the Medicare Advantage comes in and we kind of put everything altogether\nOr we kind of think about it as a Sean does it really well it's a combination played at the Mexican restaurant where we we put it all together we put your medical your prescription and everything else all in one plan and it really covers everything or under one umbrella\nSo when the chips are down we need to solve so we need to we need to solve this is I think this discussion is really good because I Know so little about it and I've said so many times this is a team sport\nYou know this aging thing is a team sport there's so many things that we don't know the island theory is the more you think you know the more you find out you don't know so you really need a a team of professionals around you\nUm we're talking with you man of brandy Johnson and Sean modest and uh and uh what I'd like to do is just quickly just cover if you if they've got questions on this subject and they would like to\nDo to have some more information is there an office number that they can call you at [noise] I'm\nActually on our office as we stayed at the beginning of the show is in Colorado Springs the best way to get a hold of Sean and I are on our cell phone okay and my cell phone number is seven one nine to three eight six three five five and Sean's is seven one nine\nTo three seven four or five one nine\nOkay and we're going to do that again at the end of the show so if you just grab your pencil and you missed it or will be able to to give you more this information at the end of the show so so that's great so some of the challenges that that you face was families you know you're walking into a variety of things when you meet with people what are the some of the biggest challenges you face\nI think education and planning our biggest challenges a lot of families have no idea what's coming and then we we don't know what's gonna happen\nAll insurance is or what if and when you really look at the big picture right so we want to just planted financially protect you and your family that's that's what our main goal in\nThe defense team yeah yeah just because you're going to see things coming that we don't see how that are still sort of amazed at how complex\nThis whole this whole system is Shaun how 'bout you what ... what are some of the challenges similar or do you if you walk in and you've dealt with families I'm getting there do you think getting their affairs in order maybe one of the big things people need to think about\nI think affairs in order huge because we'll all my kids can just throw me outside or my kids can pay for things and you're going\nNo ... I bet you if we made a phone call they probably say how much is it what do we need to do so um but yeah I I Would say truthfully we're all used to a corporate world where we have an HR person that says here you need this take this\nWhere we all retire and all of a sudden we're going what do I do where do I go\nThat's where I ... you could say brandy and I are your age are person because we can help direct even I I'm a big believer even if you didn't picky man at least we helped you make a good choice in what you're going to do next right or where to plant and what to do\nYou need a strategy team to guide you so I think this is a great discussion and they were going to ... come back and just a few moments in kind of close out the show and we'll give you the overview to ... ah you're listening to the senior living today show we'll be right back after these a brief messages so don't go away\nSometimes in our lives we need a little help whether it's you or a loved one consider visiting angels to provide the personal care you deserve visiting angels has been serving southern Colorado since two\nThousand and has been selected in the nation wide home care leadership and excellence award for twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen from one to twenty four hours a day visiting angels provides your loved ones with experience caregivers to provide the love and companionship to keep you in the place that you love the\nVest with hygiene transportation meals and like housework and you appreciate the longstanding better Business Bureau rating of a plus so when it's time for you to get a little house\nCalled visiting angels at five four three forty two twenty five four three four two two zero or go to visiting angels dot com for more information\nNow marching services like I'm Ryan ... or ... or other actors provide some funeral homes try to match their prices but if the quality behind thoughtful professional a personalized service of important for you and pencils are their loved ones there really is no match\nFor Nineteen twenty to Montgomery and see where it has remained aware that Hong count ownership and operation means a lot but it's not just being located in our\nCommunity account if the actor then I'll go to Montgomery there were a dot com I've ever done it for a team from Maine and ...\nAnd now back to the senior living today show with your host David ... a news dog five Ninety Casey as J.\nA. thanks for joining us today on the senior living today show we're coming down the home stretch this is day return on your host and I'm a news talk five Ninety Casey is Jay every Saturday morning at eight thirty", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "20"}
