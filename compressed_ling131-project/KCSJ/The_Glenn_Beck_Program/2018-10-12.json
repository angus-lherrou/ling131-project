in play and guys like you and I unfortunately we have to fight against us and then that puts us in the kill zone but to get back to the politics I Do think there's going to be a backlash I'm not sure

few weeks ago\nThe the person who is in the best position to win for the Republicans was Ted Cruz and he was only one or two points ahead of of Beto\nSo he was in the best position now it looks like they could if I mean if it's a good day they could end up with the majority of fifty four fifty five yeah that's significant\nIf especially with you know Donald Trump is president do the most hated man of all time if if\nThey do lose do you think they will say okay wait a minute this democratic socialism this anger or\nKnow that never got to do that they're going to go they're going to go murder

[laughter] just kinda hey Medicare Monaghan Duvall on [laughter]\nAll right uh Bill O'Reilly a last question here on on this stuff tell me about the press and the numbers\n[noise] okay so what's happening is not just in cable news but it's in all kinds of TV watching is that the machines are now overwhelmed the American public your devices whatever you call it the ... started it they don't watch television anymore um my kids used to they don't anymore\nAnd NOW News consumption is following in that regard so people are getting used to the fact that Bill O'Reilly dot com is there the blazes there that can get whatever they want twenty four seven I'm so why do I have to sit there and wait for some show to come on that's the under fifty five\nSet in America over fifty five they still like their martinis they liked the courts or say like eight o'clock knowing that somebody is on right\nAnd they had then but they're starting to get bored with it back because if you watch it it's not making the same thing said over and over how many times can human being said the phrase at the end of the day we're now at fifty two million times\nOn cable news\nAll right it just in sip it or to the day in sip it um and you you want information you want a vibrant opinion that perhaps as a little bit different you never get it and so it's the gas\nRather than the host the host or ... who they are and you like them you don't but I guess I mean it's just impossible along possible they really get the result\nThe erosion you can see in the demographics it's there on the page every night on the overnight ratings the younger people are going away that's the first sign and then the cracks or once Trump gets off the stage 'cause he drives everything now under ... percent in the in the media once he gets off the stage it'll collapse\nSylvia let's have been a few minutes on your on your book thank you let's let's talk about um you know I Know why you wrote this book to two parallel and show the parallel to the\nEvil and how that can happen um but I'm I'm I'm fascinated by the stories that that you tell in this\n[noise] let me tell you to know so your listeners will understand what we're doing here and there was a concentration camp name ravens book\nIt was for women just women\nIt was north of Berlin and\nNobody ever heard of it of course the concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it it\nWas known a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a bullet in your head or you went to the concentration camp so anyway at this concentration care was a young woman named ...\nHalf H. U. T. H.\nShe had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ss gorge did and she terrorized women are and participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress\nAnd went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay and then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform I'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off after the war ends of free\nComes to San Francisco or I guess the San Francisco on a refugee visa in Nineteen fifty nine alright settles marries a Jew\nEverybody in the neighborhood loves her\nFreezer nicest woman\nFifty years later they get to\nThe state department finally tracked her down sends her back to Germany where she's still alive back and every month gets\nTo the United states Social Security check\n... quite a story huh it's it's amazing how these people just disappeared\nEarly in the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we're going to separate separating from Fox they said to amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating [noise]\nUm and I looked at it on that day\nAs a as a new beginning and go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you're going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false huh it was a lie it never happened and had no one has ever ever\nCome forward it was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on to go find another job is could this could go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mind for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we're celebrating the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start Pena nice drank on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang it was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr boy and call your son call Eric right away so what's wrong is that just cleric right away I call over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying for some reason I just went right to um is he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] she said no [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was a rough day the next state went to Colorado\n[noise] and the president called me\nAs anything we can do for you I said no thank you [noise] and put it that day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to create awareness around a opioids\nAmerican or bought his antics on campus [noise] [noise]\n[noise] ... no ... so yeah so that was that day [noise] uh\nAnd so now we are a year in two days after\nThat and it's been rough calm\nYou we can stop and any time if you don't want to talk about anything so [noise] um [noise] but I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive why we're there indications\nOr was it just to dad's feelings a feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and was told to call your son right away without explaining why and I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with that no it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed it was an accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment ahead no flight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close we spent the better part of the next year just talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic\nExcuse me and uh and\nUh people parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and not sure what you're taking the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlanta to be exposed to potentially dying from an overdose\n\nIt's a very emotional and I think important um interview there are\nAre places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think ten of\n'em and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody no matter what side you're on the opioid thing\nSo in other words a person who is supposedly protesting for women's rights violently attacked a woman for\nExercising her women's rights at this point it is impossible to keep up with the contradictions I've lost count on them however\nIt's yet another warning that we are slipping into a zone that we have not seen necessarily a before or at least in a very very long\nTime we\nCouldn't use our star for this movie and we've convince them to ah let us use Steve to uh do a program immediately after this and welcome to the program now Steve\nDay so are you I'm doing well get to see guys that were really really excited about this starts on Monday\nYeah starts on Monday he's still going to be on see our TV's still gonna be doing it see our TV thing but\nHe's doing a two hours of for us every day tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] that that are just moving in with pat when you say the second best one hears that have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTwo [laughter] to help move in that way this is why he is a genius [laughter] do you\nKnow we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve a the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\n[noise] ah because we think that one of the big problems in our country there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time 'cause we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory uh of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs at our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend ... and I'm perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them by myself I had a doctor or a Denver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had David Reuben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress there is\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees either maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and new arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAt any somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you a little league game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nLondon is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God's says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are the outside outside of the Haiti arena I agree that there are you know I see people people think\nThat I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no\nPelosi I Can't talk grilled cheese no interest in she has the auto industry wants to end you want to share a country where she just it's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most cherished\nThe thing on both sides is they just want to win mhm so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's a dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen she got pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd roe v Wade happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheat and want to be a kid in the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than men for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more in conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years though guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news that are earning later I Can't I Can't ...\nDo you watch them never that he was it was up when I'm On the year ... from India and unless that status and hang on just a second I Want the audience\nTo know that's unheard of in our business ... that you could not have done is ... without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go viral and social media long form it's just toxic ingestion and the vast yeah yeah my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics that to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watch the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away filed okay yeah um and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine whites Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail because she's not fine if we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with\nThat ... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like communists right and so we have\nWe have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I've worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down and did the talking points we in conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants on wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time it actually totally in reverse the majority of it and and you know it's fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down in the twenty sixteen electorate at the bit libertarian the myth of the libertarian voter as how they define them that their voter largely does not exist as a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to leave me off and doesn't care about me guys tend to one at minimum it's not even close and then the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate heat and dust\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he didn't give you the token I'm pro life he stood up in front of a hundred million people at the presidential debate and said I'm going to appoint justices that will overturn roe [laughter] okay\nTill things then we're at the point where like in our anniversary yes I knew that it was tomorrow trust one eight hundred flowers

big change on Sunday snow likely only thirty one drop [noise]\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with us Steve days pat gray a stew a steeper gear or executive\nProducer and of course my charming self um we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have ever called her saying a kick 'em when they're down\nIs is the is this the\nOr is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\n... ah um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with many sensibility left in them\nUh are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a goal but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with the stability thing\nThat they're completely ah issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change a say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist no movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever and now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we're we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore\nI think we're Balkan iced if you get the reference I'm making here so okay let's let's pick it up\nThere how do we um how do we come come back and ah how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have\nMuch more in common with us because\nThey do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may not back in ...\nGlen ... show on ... news Tong five Ninety Casey as Jane\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nGlad that probably [noise] so I talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group it\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they didn't hide God three times and their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that\nHad decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is if this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dose in Darwinism it has its own it cleans the allergy where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removed the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and the kings seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan said this guy say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes\nSure where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be ... and that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor\nYou're you're attacking their idol this is not mere political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing the understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] famous short were they so\nThey can translate that into human language [laughter] uh I I I think we see that with\nGlobal warming with a with their reaction to abortion was loose roe v Wade thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things ... it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is ... is the his\nYeah they do and you're right if they don't necessarily know they don't know but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children he wanted your children\nIt'd be sacrificed on an idle you would have permit skew is sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the girls in the groves and then\nWhen you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff
