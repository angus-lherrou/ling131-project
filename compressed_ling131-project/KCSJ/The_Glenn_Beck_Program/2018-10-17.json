I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nAs it\nTurns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this\nHappened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent um but it\nLooks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went\nRogue ... but it's kind of hard to believe\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then\nThe Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\nI don't know\nIf they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if the Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it's finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh\nThe the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in\nHere or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true [noise] this\nMay be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exists and this tape comes out we have all known that\nSaudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exists and comes out people of the world will for ever think of Saudi Arabia and put them in the same class as Stalin as Hitler as Mabhouh or as Kim Jong moon\nAh in in uh\nNorth Korea but we remember North Korea's crimes we only have sketches of\nIf this tape exists and comes out it's a game changer that could destabilize everything will go back into the\nStory in a second first let me tell you our sponsor is one eight hour one eight hundred flowers dot com the

style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia is a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously\nBecause if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and Tom to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because that's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours\nThey are selling us crap that quite honestly I

process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want ... on the streets in mass beating people up and telling women that there has been shut rotten the grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politician saying that the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this

growing in America the press is excusing a antifa they are excusing everything the Democrats are saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and\nSaid it's time to bring the gear teams out for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets\nYou um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] why do it peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper or with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have\nUm some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing because that's almost ... possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ashes really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive the most and art\nIn our society the press sympathizes with all of them they sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes are there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive\nCauses so ... that's a big\nDifference we didn't have that what was that a left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's what we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say a a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... march for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nA that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out there just what happened is that an over the weekend is ...\nAnd then he grew up doing that would have to hire security\nThey'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press\nIs actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still try to do with Trump into basically dismissing\nSaudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran\nIn the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism and\nDestruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy\nThat nation when in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nPictures and send them to them and they they'll actually look at them and help you design\nYeah and there do you think would look good right and then they'll put the drapes in the picture and you had to like okay that's great that's what the blinds and they'll show you and when

calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com basin right\nMore than likely the full three years of the ISIS occupation and muzzle and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS you know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so\nLiving behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of societies that true [noise]\nWe did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and and it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWere seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me they're white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to are saying I I've got to do I've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to Burma mhm right yes and now you're working\nWith an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talked you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update forth yes absolutely so\nAh also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as her infant or ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border and\nThey they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have the ... okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the ... army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people\nAlive so why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just as a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more\nTell me what you wrote me so I brought a brought with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy its best they're apologizing for getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos of of what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened um this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is their intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby and that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and the baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and warm army still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time\nThe ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and\nI Can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the arm army him and his family have fled the Burma Army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the other end fund was there and he came and found me and he said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark it's bark from a tree\nAnd he's like this is all we have the snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and she has nothing is literally nothing\nAnd she wanted to give me a tree bark because that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark but this man\nAnd I I was I was so overcome was just like I\n... his gratitude at the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the ... being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle another man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he is driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh\nLike oh you good English or what I'm trying to paint him and talk more about um um I'm about what what use more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what do you know yeah and he's like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nSo I had someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they\nCan't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know two or does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nHow they can they caught somebody up alive alive they butchered him alive caught him up and\nPut them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get\nTrump what is wrong with you people that's wrong with\nThe it was like legitimately like a sickness for some of them I thought if not CNN but I mean it is it as a network\nAs a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really does dominate to their lives every aspect or at least there's at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nAgain like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting 'cause she's gonna be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean a real flop eared what we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried\nShe has to come and get ahead of this or again it is a ... it's an important political story for somebody who is going to run for president yeah\nBut really with Saudi Arabia [noise] going on right now with that and what that possibly means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why anybody talking about that why is it now\nCheck out the lens blog got five dining case yes J. dot com back\nWednesday October Seventy one years down the Bree I our radio asked her radio podcast video featuring a brand new episode with

I\nTend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible\nInteresting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here in Texas\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is or I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points yeah every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you'd think a great read country right in Texas mhm however uh the poll\nShows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine\nForty eight but still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nLook at it this way try this on for size or a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I know in talking about the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "17"}
