I'm going through the right steps you know the cutting of it a little pieces and put them into suitcases and I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards and it's interesting\nToo that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter I ... I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff\nMember of the Washington Post columnist wasn't any or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one with the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty years ago and he's all outage and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about four they been\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point now there wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage\nToday the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is tense of right I mean remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before\nHe ... he walked out of the room remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who's ... who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since the Harlem Harlem me there was a decision made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand and one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was a risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options in and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune his reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ... um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into\nOh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars of course\nThere are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] that our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant\nTo the relationship right I mean that there was there are these considerations and that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based\nOn you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day\nAmerican interests are harmed long term\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your\nTop priority is not a ... murders in Turkey right like\nThe beginning right out of anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore such studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a\nIf you'd be pissed off of ... yeah they'll call us mass that we're not as we are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you what do you are on the commercial on a jaguar\nWhat it's like they like if you come up with a name on your own\nMaybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced but what is a word\nWe already know and when I say you were a hundred years it stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to right every citizen jak you are [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that the I think that's jak you are\nTrying to seem refined right\nLike this like um there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... er jaguars like at the stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog\nAnd then this Yankee water [laughter] would you be gone [laughter] exactly where they're ripping up by a bitter and into my dog is terrible I but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it so everything's gonna be okay [laughter]\nThat happens is you know ... three times last week alone for me and it was

you know do you have some very modest [laughter] so we'll see how that turns out we'll give you the updates when we get them or we need to warn you about\nSomething that's incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses that there is some danger there Karen nightly\nIs promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ... from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her and she says don't rescue yourself obviously\nAnd this is the one I'm but she ... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self yes she didn't pull herself out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man\nOr a man yeah thank you mhm there's a lot of women are doing that today\nThe main message ... or ... of really the entire movie is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy that's\nThe message you should be taking from those movies I'm Christian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes [laughter]\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she read Snow White del taco bell\nYes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I looked at my girls and ask don't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no\nI'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it\nA while you nailed that one there did wrist and then she'll also say and\nGirls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission\nWell no because she's in a coma mom [laughter] can't camera permission and she'll stay in a column I ... doesn't cancer\nRight I mean she's advocating for the government could continue right the gangs are out of it\nRight and bell says uh because you can't kiss someone if they're sleeping\nOn how does that mean in my circumstances that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book right the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's\nA magical apple\nThere's a a a print or with a magical spell right on the princess yes and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise\nThat yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that part of your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself still worked up about the you know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did this\n[laughter]\nThey just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I can understand this you know sometimes I think even\nYou know ... like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon because we're watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I Know it was a captain planet or whatever and all of that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about

turkey about the disappearance of a Washington\nPost columnist President Trump says he's looking forward to a long talk this morning with secretary of state Mike ... just back overnight from turkey and Saudi Arabia\nI Want to find out what happened where is this fall and we will probably know that by the end of the ... neither the president I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does\nNor Palmdale we'll talk about what's reportedly of gruesome audiotape or the killing of Washington Post journalist your mark ... inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey\nSystem and when you try to go around that and you try to say well we know better than the police we know better than the investigators because I don't know it really looks bad or ah I don't know it really looks like a this was this happened\nThat that that's a terrible direction to go and lead you don't all full roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly\nYeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago\nAnd yet uh\nI just saw an article today above from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ...\nAre just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time in the ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't care you occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know the debate still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest paid per capita\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the ... the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um\nBut the other people and Cory Booker do not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so you could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but what are you judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... that story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find that Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so now while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days with the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was\nIn the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see\nOccasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after\nThey never want to hear about either one of their uh stories ever get to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them but I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes a\nBig level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that the media\nActually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with\nActual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that the system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and an even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard that can sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some actual evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's tried to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that and they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad they'd even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nBook and the killing series

Ninety Casey is Jay\nCheck out the lens blog fine dining case yesterday dot com\nWord Glenn Beck still the beauty of a dry for your Thursday morning I twenty five is running without any issues in both directions to New Mexico and Colorado Springs no clashes ourselves yet to slow you down watch for volume building on highway Fifteen both directions that's an avenue had Norwood avenue and ... avenue I'm ... with traffic [noise]\nYou're listening to Glenda program with patents do triple eight Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little\nPod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah none of them they said yes that are part of this dug up with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something\nThat against motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics hour to an absolutely yeah the power to make it makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly led to have her\nFired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation I got to go away it only what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them people were other comedians\nAnd one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there or something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was because this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a\nWife or the child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're\nRight I have issues and that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation\nHe asked her to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I I have issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no amateur watched what she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right and he admitted in such a\nGeneral way that people kind of a make eating people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think that that\nWould I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no\nAnd and they and the idea that you\nKnow Lucy K because he's a famous uh\nComedian can affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again he's making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the focus scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nSo down and listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks into does the ... or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose the gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner about why you\nLet him on stage this is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nWas some other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy and he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like\nNever mhm might never says never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never misses an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say particularly to a female customer who is somebody that's on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like people who are on the right pay the price for it where people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point\nWhere someone like Lucy K who was I think are accused could correctly of being a dirt bag right who was in it to his own admission but\nNot not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least it's\nNot as reported you know you have to look at these\nThings as they said I mean these are is now doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr the Glen or what the heck is his name you know to get it wrong thrush right used of uh of harassing a young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird saying why I mean Mike Tyson\nIt's pretty clear the man was convicted of rape not not accurate time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling of the media he comes out of you guys it's silly appearances we have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean and look he served time and he's out right now\nUm and so you can make the case as the left has made forever that people who go in felons you'll be able to come back and vote you should be we their programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accuse if he is yeah it really doesn't make any sense AAA seven twenty seven back is\nThe phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nUh is traverse ing currently or the Mediterranean Sea in a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is a week so

it\nWell do you how did he lie what do you lie about it he said he drink to excess from time to time yep\nWhat are you lie about the idea is that we're all other because other people around and we're like well I think he ... people did blackout how the hell the you know you're not only he would know that right uh you know and maybe he did I I don't see how that all that ah\nThere's no way to know that and to the conversation but still there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the subtle\nAccusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people in the left but you know I'm sure a restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want them on the Supreme Court\nRight and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened yeah\nI don't either and it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that is so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't fair but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who\nWere there and they can't remember the party like what are we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike for\nThe party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like you have to take in motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea basically I think people almost like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call herself survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... million things are possible you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nNot whether they should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk\nAbout uh yeah I Know we talk about\nThe the women's right to choose it is just fainted as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one I wouldn't defend my children's lives\nAs strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children\nHit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans the idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right\nThat you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused of high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay this happens all the time you know why\nPeople are horrible\nMany of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things\nThat you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you can like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused we can they do we know\nFor a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser which I'm Michael ... and no\nOne including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\nAnd in the second one is the is that there's a ... they're right when they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\nThat's the old act on Sunday ... operating what evidence on that one either and they're ... and look the Fort one was only I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people they're just with no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible\nJob it recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the like\nState who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said they were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like the media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you you brought up to high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him the credits didn't like him to really encourage\nI cannot hold up I wouldn't think so but the the the community as a plotting the police swift success the swift excessive locating interesting him\nIs due to the timely information provided by numerous concern teens and adults as well as the cooperation of the park ridge police department and the cook county sheriff's bleak ... is this what was he was a a multi\nDepartment good uh operation and she'd get this kid we did this story come around no do we here at the end but by the way they found out it was an air soft gun and now he's you know this story you know ...\nCause I mean it let's just say you had a realistic looking air soft gun ... that media lost it a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the end yes just bakery no let's just say that fell off or something or you can eat it at blackberry what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by me like a what the hell's going on and sharing the police yeah and what happens if they show up\nAnd they talk to them they owe generic ...
