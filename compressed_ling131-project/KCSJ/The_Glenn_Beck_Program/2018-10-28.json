I'm Joe ... Fox News thousands of people jammed in intersection and met a light rain for a vigil listening for the victims of the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue eleven people were killed six others injured including for police officers suspect surrender and is now under us\nUm and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out again\nIn this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose this at any ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party in all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two dozen six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy it is a a\n... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen even if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively so relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of\nEach and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now to show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the\nRaces they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\nA band they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seats from where they are now\nBut also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still going to have investigative power could have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you\nKnow places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf ... oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had a bad a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real a real it's really going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... there is an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten we're at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest then partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that's of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah\nAnd there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nSane right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be in writing her life was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I'd go for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more of this one could come down\nTo the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked about among them a lot about this Huh Interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense in ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen who was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one\nThis year so this is a whatever the reason while they were not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIt's I mean the only thing I can think of is\nThe Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they're being quote unquote held in cages in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it outside after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrant a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but if it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine percent in two thousand sick\nIt says you know it is our whole lives that this is going to be interesting it is that like it's like\nYou know back in the nineties the opening of Star Wars yeah it's this is now what people care about and they care about it and almost like a cultural entertainment sort of way be which is I think fascinating\nAnd not necessarily healthy [noise] it's good that people care about these things but you know I don't think that people a lot of people don't seem to care about them about the issues as much as they do about just the passionate disagreement with whoever they're on

and don't\nTry to a fashion or at least ... around its neck take it for a walk it\nAin't gonna do it so\nHow do we handle Saudi Arabia well should be the same way we handled turkey but we're not because we're looking at turkey and Saudi Arabia with American eyes stop it these are both Islamic states now their warring with each other why\nBecause one is Muslim Brotherhood and one is a ... hobby is they don't like each other they want death for everybody in the other state\nThey want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd Saudi Arabia Webster key stopped\nBecause there will hobbyists we're being\nPut in the middle of a fight between to Islam assist both of them want the caliphate both of them want Islamic rule both of them want to rule uh with jihad and they also want to rule which Rio law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those so now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place horrible horrible horrible horrible place they execute kids as long as you've shown any kind of signs of puberty you're\nTried as an adult they execute through beheading ... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet uh but Saudi ... woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each got you know between two and nine

tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nWhat's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about ah education I I have\nA complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal I hang up before it sure let's start with me I should go into ... absolutely on them when talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers it's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old\nFeel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children one of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten\nEleven twelve years old why centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way should go or you're clearly these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do hear that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about the really do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nLet me give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better finished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low cost control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't\nBecause here's the problem with getting ready to analyze testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding it's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we could still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that sixty two counties across the office you to call you the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty ... ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids it thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWest terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we used to say I wonder why hasn't the work ethic we've\nGot a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic at one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system that I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey can ask a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that the biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who then we go back again not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story\nNow okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and gets into your degree why should they be boarding school and they should be one school\nNext you don't want those things now worries go to your trade school go to ... to become a plumber comment or whatever you want to be about mechanic H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and you're doing it's a problem so do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now is sixteen I worked at sixteen and lots of people imagine if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAround it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use good luck\nHis ... his wife prompt she's going to happen\nA bunch of coup prep schools will pop up a bunch of great great schools will pop up I guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most\nGuaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to make this will pop up it'll be amazing\nThat is the best part when he schools pop up now we're spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelve feathers is more than four billion dollars\nWe've said all of the federal funds\nWe've removed tons of administrators\nWe've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel is appropriate we've got rid of Common Core a we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... I think the corps the unhappy kids now thinking about this dilemma twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo believe that isn't there the ... kids in something else the kids are bullied because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but not me go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade discipline problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught\nWhat's killing our children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class\nI Can't go she ... the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I've got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore\nWe're living in a world of massive change yeah massive change and when's the last time you heard any politician sound or anything like this\nRunning for governor of New York his name is Larry shore or you want to find out more\nGo to Larry sharp as H.
