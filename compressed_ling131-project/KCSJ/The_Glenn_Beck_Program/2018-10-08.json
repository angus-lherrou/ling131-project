hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of All right and it's out when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving you know\nI'm more than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate\nYou can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you that is scary\nIt is you are you lead us out in the in the creepy line\nI'm about how Google has really stripped itself a bowl ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda [noise] um and then ah ... how they have\n... you know the ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where you you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and\nYou got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this and national a study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism\nUh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability to shift people\nThinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use ah ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results that's not like a news story that just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the this is the system that they would have\nDreamt of for propaganda [laughter]\n[noise] oh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article a called a\nCan of ways big tech can shift millions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation effects are seen as the eye me that's just one of ten ways\nUh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nAnd they they they are I mean some of these effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences and they're ... or ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret uh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using\nThe Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created\nAnd so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nOr you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them\nAnd uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually be able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world\nAnd will will I think they all to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh\nYou know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I Would say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nA that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nMIT trouble [laughter] ...\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm who's ... [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good in the good and the good news I mean the the good news is that um\nThat Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use\nA is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now interesting lapse in New York Times the times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on\nBase share all of their emails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing\nYou know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google and I wrote a piece about that it was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago good news is you don't do that\nYou're okay let's end it there for ... [laughter] this is this has been asking that for a second\nIt will come back with the bad news plus ... the the I think he's in ten different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but these big tech companies and\nSome of the other things that uh he has found how they are monitoring our children and it is remarkable and we are running out of time in a before Google is the dominant than\nJust can be stopped are sponsored this half hour\nIs gold mine President Trump has been warning about the risk to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress was November and the risks are pretty uh\nPretty dire uh and especially coupled with what the Democrats were saying this weekend there are several stories out this weekend say that they have to become more radical uh ... in their their push back\nWell now the good news is again you you you do not share your emails with Google a lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do but it's bad news is\nThat a Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so what that means that everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in\nThe yeah well sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and the products are so good so but you don't realize that these are real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\n[laughter] uh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is that film that you mentioned the creepy lie has a when\n... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer on your show recently though is uh uh he's the one who would who really got that film running a it surely wasn't\nAvailable but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tunes for for rental or sale and it's it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just goes to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\nWell when I when my research a first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have these amazing screen shots that they're just shocking\nTo people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have three and shot showing getting these time out saying no no you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay let's go through some of the\n... some of the uh affects that you were monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there\nWas the last seven ten or ten of these but your\nFollowers ten altogether okay\nOut an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when okay here we go this is called\nDeath as the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type\nSo if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty votes among a fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split with all my one having any idea that they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay we're gonna come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and\nWhat we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the creepy line\nIt's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com\n... news talk on the go diehard radio and five Ninety Casey as Jane dot com\n\nCheck out the lens block five Ninety case yesterday dot com word\nGlenn Beck getting around Pueblo this morning north and South Bend I twenty five you are going to see things going to be a little bit more difficult than normal it's put it that way they should make your way out\nAs far as I'm twenty five is it's been a good shape coming down from fountain in Colorado Springs are making the way all the way down past week warm uh nobody problems on fifty or fifty west just floating school zones of slow right now it'd be usual spots I'm ... good morning\nIf the Klan that probably\nRobert Lipsyte he's a senior research psychologist American Institute for behavioral research and technology he is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about last week I saw\nLast week and it is indeed very creepy it is\nUm it's it's is it too much to say it's\nMore on the ... we're apt mind control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] ah well we've been here for a long time so there's a you know uh there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than two point five billion people soon to be over four billion\nA whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected\nA dramatically uh every single day by a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's only one way we then have the surge suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the target ...\nSure targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing affect a is really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to\nBut if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that wasn't even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional\nFour hundred and fifty thousand boats now gosh I I don't I\nI don't think he did that because you know he was very over confident or you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not I'm I'm a I'm a moderate in and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so\nI'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't that what targeted advertising is\nAll about but it said targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive so\nCan I mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally yeah yeah yeah\nOh no you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented power or to ... ... is shifts to people yes shift unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power\nUh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get creep out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\nWith everything that is going on please the best thing to do is to prepare now for a natural disaster or some sort of an emergency situation ask yourself right now did you feed yourself and your family for two weeks with the food that you have at home right now\nIt's time to act and secure in emergency food supply I use my patriots apply and I recommend you do to a two week food kid will get you started this week it's on sale for only Seventy five dollars when you go to my special website prepare with Glenn dot com or called eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three\nWho did includes meals at last up to twenty five years in storage order now eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or prepare with Glenn dot com [noise]\nOne of the Lewis news talk online at five Ninety JAGS Jane dot com [noise]\nHi Michelle milk and hear the gods now movie opens on October twelfth dean Cain and the entire cast was her job bringing this to during the big screen\nHow the woman goes into a funny comes on that and there's no police report you might be very\nDifferent movies too scary it's not as a mother of two I promise you can bring your teenage children to bring friends and family kids we have a unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion don't miss out\nCormac God's Neal is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history God's know rated PG Thirteen\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's\nPremier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about on certain three year fixed rate loan Scott across information in conditions equal housing liquor licensing office ... states animal is number three thirty additional conditions exclusion may play\nDuring college former NFL Super Bowl champion signed the most important contractor for his life to serve in the Army National guard\nAround a lot of military my family as far as one of my family for a long time I want to go on or make a difference I didn't find that working behind the desk so for me [laughter] and then they offered to survive\nFor my country was just like to learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard here by the Colorado broadcasters association at this station\nThat\nI have dealt with some frightening things before but I think that was the most frightening our I've I've ever spent on the radio I I I'm not speechless and I think I was speechless twice\nIn that interview 'em I mean just a quick thing they talked about with a fifty fifty proposition being able to be changed to Ninety ten proposition just by suggestion by ...

really well really good [noise]\nYou know this is something that I've been talking about for years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said someday it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there I've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour why did that affect you so much\nUm couple of things uh one I think like we all there's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that\nThere's some evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they made ... like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true in a lot of these um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really\nA major thing this is a ... you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they bone in all this is like a lot as a leader\nIn in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research\nCenters it's Harvard I mean this guy is near the real deal with some real credibility again comes the sun is that hard on the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to se discrepancy Hillary as voter\nRight right um but beyond that uh I seems incredibly hopeless to me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people how to persuade people to look at the world and a slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you\nKnow someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right ah and we talk about that stuff all the time but I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder\nTo make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to on my wind myself from Google\nI honestly have no idea how I Would do that and I'm In I'm not even use an Android me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go a Google device yeah not\nUse them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance\nApparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do\nIs it's the best what right like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's\nThe best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right um you know uh the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's better than a you know I'm ... I mean you know it's you get into deep stuff and you but I don't even know how just to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using it and I went to duck to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on chrome\nSo now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life has turned upside down and I can't I\nCan't come up with enough personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say three\nHundred million word yet documentary million ... is like a ... of of\nData on you\nAnd that ... million pages pages of data and again like but I I don't know what is the personal cost to me in that data well there's several things there's some things that could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really\nNegative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent go the way the Google wants them to go ... incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before you\nAre you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean\nThe other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that\nIt is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to the problem is not today this is not today\nIt's just technology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth in ways that we will not be able to understand I mean\nAs the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use it you said when you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak\nOh yeah but I mean they fail in their right right\nIt's it's it I mean it ... you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years and he's a he's a Clinton supporter ... is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it backs that up yeah and that's that's what's terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe pissed right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a row search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton\nIs not some wild crazy theory it's something that's already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really accurate ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and as this stuff escalates they're going to feel justified to take more overt action and you got only knows where that ends up I I ...
