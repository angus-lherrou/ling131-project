I mean 'cause I saw lots of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because their votes were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight on the ground and remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of wanting them in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out\nIn to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and\nBrett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been\nPretty and by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like charging cities and they're taking over that's ... that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people\nEspecially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violent\nOkay and and the quote is\nA mob of protesters that their usage\nSo is this not a disorderly crowd of people that are trying to what we've done a ... percent on causing truck in tenth on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not tell us in trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess we are in that that doesn't does it say there and\nUnless you're right just as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media does not the\nHarassing conservatives that's causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a parade feed it that's like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things but uh yeah I mean they say I [laughter] the Irish guy who runs\nThis all ... [laughter] let me tell you I mean the white people if they do it was a white people really do ya [laughter] really bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things\nFirst we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtesters guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change\nThe description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy for what a mob a protest it looks like he\nIs a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I said things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he sat knock the crap out of them oh what'd you and seriously okay ... I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push\nProtests as again to\nSorry sorry [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThey go anywhere we see this now here's\nHere's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says\n... I think there's a real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face\nHe he may think that that's okay but what do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which state's college was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] basically has almost killed he was yelling this is for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a my ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we\nDon't want to encourage them we have to somehow record it down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK ever reason for or a means we're trying to resolve things I feel that there's going to be in a fascination I really worry that someone is going to be killed [noise] and\nUh that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually getting getting their face they have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this over to our church\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like brick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target to the district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested from the Tea Party\nRiots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nThere's four hundred just last weekend on the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because you do mean violence\nWeb conditions a little slippery in a few areas be careful\nYou know your neighbor and your town teacher do you know your judge\nJudges are vital members of our community they

speaker news talk five Ninety KCBS Jay\n\n[noise]\nAnd the ... you know if you look at the the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history you will find that it is almost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil unrest if you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and and ... that's\nYou know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting riots usually called strikes now some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race but a lot of\nThese come from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first ... a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the clan\nA clan goes real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it ... to the military and all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen onward will that's because of segregation and all of the things that a progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike mayday riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike any of those\nSeems a labor related I was the last labor related doesn't it and labor it who\nI'm Sorry if you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world\nWho are the international workers' of the world that is of course are based in communism and Mars is it is the communist army here in America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nYou also had in Nineteen sixteen the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco a you had a um a you had read summer which was about twenty of them you had made a riots\nYou had the ... massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing\nThat was the left and communist saying you you can't get involved in the war\nBecause it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say that we're icicle is with a bomb bright this trail you a massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization\nThat was against a all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up rioting and killing people okay good\nThen you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties it's\nEssentially it was a an industrial workers of the\nWorld and by ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth through October twelve\nThat wouldn't shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike\nThe battle of the overpass the republic steel strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots have\nCommunist and Marxist fingerprints on them\n\nI said it's it's a fundamental to the ideology right repetition is fundamental to the ideology is not surprising that this was happening again ... I just I'm I'm really tired of\nOf sharing a or I should say it this way I'm really tired of the media and their lives\nBloodshed take it take it take it until they couldn't take it anymore and they then rose the declaration of independence which did not lead with why they were so mad instead they wrote up please me this is who we are\nAnd will stand you just seem to want to fight I Am not with you by look to win\n[noise]\n[laughter] I Want to tell you about pro flowers if you need to send somebody in a sari nuts pro flowers I'm a one eight hundred flowers dot com if you need to send somebody uh flowers you need to apologize to somebody who you\nAnd you you screwed up with your wife for whatever send\nOne eight hundred flowers dot com they have your back send the flowers right now they have a special that is happening right now if you use the promo code or back you're going to get a dozen red roses are multi colored roses for twenty nine Ninety nine but if you use the ... they'll give you another doesn't so two dozen roses\nAbsolutely absolutely free the extra doesn't end the free glass base go there now one eight hundred flowers dot com it's one eight hundred flowers dot com use the promos code back [noise]\nOn the radio on the Web to find ... case she has ... dot com\nOkay you're a busy business person you're trying to hire somebody and\nYou've got a job site that it's just overwhelming you with tons of the wrong resumes that's\nNot smart here's what he is smart zip recruiter dot com slash back unlike other job sites zip recruiter doesn't wait for the candidates to find you it goes out and\nFind them for you zip recruiter dot com slash back has powerful matching technology that scans thousands\nOf resumes identify people with the right skills the right education and experience for your job and then invites them to apply so you get the quality candidates and the qualified people through the door first and you don't have to sort through things because they already do that and they highlight the best people\nIt's no wonder that zip recruiters rated number one by employers in the U.S right now\nYou can try it for free at this exclusive Web address its zip recruiter dot com slash back that zip recruiter dot com slash ... dot com slash back fry it today it's the smartest way to hire\nAnd and this is Sean Hannity morning minute Morgan Stanley\nSaid the belief in American exceptionalism among global investors\nHas never been higher organs daily guy by the name of ...

he is um he's a guy that we had books last hour and I\nKind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are\nTrue to be civil and kind to one another but we were not at a place where I think he grabbed the gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime and rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've gotta walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today\nBut it but I but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups\nRather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hartford did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats we have some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability\nThat we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example you can't war at a people and\nReach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\nBut ... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... if it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke of the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life and left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nIn Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and and and gun for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject I think it matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nImportant we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game for small just ... but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses in Jesus\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling remodeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back\nIn just a second first let me tell you about gold lying\nOr President Trump has been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress this November we will see an impeachment proceedings that does not mean that they will remove him from office but they will impeach him\nA the ... the the first chance they get if they win the house if they win the house and the Senate you're gonna see gridlock you're going to see nothing really nothing good\nLiterally chained a as slaves\nOr you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and\nSaid we understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about are trying to hold back the advance of course it either pagan\nAnd he says this I'll watch the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about
