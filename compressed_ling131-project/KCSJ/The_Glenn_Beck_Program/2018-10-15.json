listening to Glenn Beck program ... was\nStarted writing an essay last night um and I posted up on slate of Facebook but I I I I I I Want to spend some time going over it with you you\nKnow the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse it's really not no it's not\nMay you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find it being sad is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is\nAnd uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of the treaties\nSo he said look [noise] not so long ago\nI spent ... years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed up on us so it's not Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find\nThis but I've always liked that because I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a\nIt's just the saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorced everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that it took a dark chapter in my life\nThat they taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways\nIs it going to make you angry\nAre you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you through enlightenment through correction new understandings humility\nIt's up to you\nSo living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we'll learn the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility\nIn DC in Hollywood of a story today to tell you about Michael ... who's now quitting the music industry\n\nSays he's tired of the celebrity nonsense everybody on the left and the right we all have an ego problem we're utterly convinced that our side is absolutely right and if you violate that if\nYou violate one part of that you're a traitor you're a traitor to the race the party the cause whatever they are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong there there is\nAnd what we face in the end\nIs not going to be smaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world wars it's not going to be any less frightening than the global economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be greater either it's just going to be hours\nAnd just like the generations gone by it'll be our choice whether or not we survive\nI think this is a blessing\nThe boomers never got to see who they really were the boomers\nFeast it off the crisis of their parents they never really had to choose for themselves\nLike the greatest generation did life or death freedom or slavery they never had to push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\n\nThe crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing to blessing our parents never received\nEach of us it's going to have to choose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come who we really are\nIf we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see the struggle in the proper like we did Mitt that it's the softness of our foundations that have caused all these troubles it's\nAre wanting an easier life not making the hard choices not having to say no not having to say yes\nBut Brock Obama nor Donald Trump or the problem or the solution there

great city that you have you have all of us are honest and we really look at our situation we all know we all see the same symptoms\nAll know that we as a nation or sick were really really sick and we have we have each of us have doctors and their each prescribing the opposite medicine\nAnd each of us as patients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our society\n\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family say that's not the cure because we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become\nMore vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\nNow at the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing and well we're all fighting\nOver the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were just too busy fighting what our doctor said\n\nNo I don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know this society is sick we are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally and usually I'm not good at making friends at that point\nI don't think you are either we snap at each other we act as our lesser selves\nBecause when I'm sick I'm I hurt and I am full of despair or I'm fearful\nOr I just don't have the patience and Everytime I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad most difficult day every day it seems and it gets worse every day\n\nI Want those doctors to know I Want those\nI Want those to know that actually do just want to watch the world to burn I Want you to know that it's true we know there are dangers in difficulties crisis that lie ahead of us\nBut don't just assume that we're just going to lie down and watch our country burned down it's not\nIn fact many if not most of us who voted for Democrats and those who voted for Republicans have a ton in common and I found in common with those who voted for neither while the parties and the\nPoliticians tried to convince as otherwise and many of us may have believed for a while or even engaged in this warfare it's becoming more and more clear to more and more Americans that our neighbors are not the enemy no matter who they voted for\nAnd if you're not there yet or your neighbors not there yet\nAsked them to ponder this who in your family came here\nI don't care if it was

your program reading out from the paper I wrote previously with Peter ... the ... as a social construct\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey uh to publish open access journals that as apparently fairly low are very low\nUm review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was definitely fun fun right um yeah he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that um but yeah so what do you learn\nAnd we we took the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people\nContinue to address it a secondly we decided that\nUm we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I know you talk to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers in striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know who you at twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence that I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and an article where they

feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just say this is this an act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility wants\nTo determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and leftist fit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um the the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to reach ... over\nHim interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that\nMean to the university system would would what does that mean\nAll events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess as the best way to say that but also probably into some of the general and stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to\nPretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us
