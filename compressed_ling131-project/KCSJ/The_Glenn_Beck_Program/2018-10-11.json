positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Chevy Cruze going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou may you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so yeah the point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls was one poll that had them tied at one point\nUm ah ah several polls showed cruise only up by one or two New York times doing something really really interesting in which you know normally you kind of see\nThe ... news well I didn't say that they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happens and then you go after them right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the resulted in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho was voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addictive do watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I add one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is for them to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is it's part of that and why it's hard to read you know\n'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's

to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high employment I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWork good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those facts of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we used to or she real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know bother from out of these are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to this is\nThe fed and and a ... journal drawn Powell why you've taken a punch bowl away from this party just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation would never leave lesion watcher guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and that\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I ... my only point is I just think the fed\nActed preemptively and prematurely and raising rates in in a in a way that wasn't that sort I Am a little concerned by the way I go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why hasn't gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just like okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the I'm In the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um you know about the price of the global\nReduction in supply as a result\nOf having sex that back online bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick stick\nOn the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next year or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know that's the stock market is driven by fear in great [laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and then by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife I let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale\nBut the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the president as his chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct type\nI I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence\nBut they've made so many mistakes you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake and I you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis\nTwo thousand seven and they keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know I don't know\nLet me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it even as what he really fundamentally believes that tariffs are good\n[laughter] here's my view I talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I Know trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal here or he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that\nThe deal had to be seals candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics are using all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nUh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China then I'll let\nMe challenged beyond that whenever I uh you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way chop looks at it and I think he's right about this like if we can't trade with China we'd sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets mean damn near everything\nYou buy in Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to play by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time of blind who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market yeah you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your trade secrets ... I mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I didn't start this trade deal\nThis trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you know you probably have a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs in these things going on of allies\nAre ... like Canada and as a way of negotiating to bring these country off at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA two point oh type of situation well that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change at any point\nWell this is what are the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum tariffs or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum because you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but\nWe've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over at and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make\nA you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and ... that's going on around the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel tariffs so my point to Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of this so\nSince showers Rob today today fifty two for a high ... thirty seven for low sunny and sixty
