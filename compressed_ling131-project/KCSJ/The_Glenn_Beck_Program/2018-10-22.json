nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um he said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nFifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats it started with a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three\nTo Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections however Republicans have jumped\nA higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would\nBe the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nSo relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the\nRaces they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in ... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean\nAnd they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still gonna have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have in\n... it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in\nWatching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance at this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate\nAs you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like chipping away I'm the type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo\nYeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being tired light like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that is growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... that I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting it was sad to hear Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan\nOf of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's there's burger yeah definitely we talked a lot of them a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it's going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\n[noise]\nIt ... I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened\nI mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it at some after okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants are caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine personal and to ...\nWhere is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by another group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy\nThere was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and we have found that\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving prince because that's not true\n... news talk on the go a diehard radio at five Ninety case yes Jane dot com and\n[noise] the check out the lens blah [laughter] five Ninety case yesterday dot com\nWord Glenn\nHow you drive do Pueblo ... you know right now you actually see the good traffic flow both north and south bound the twenty five ... or giving through town itself of course it's Monday school's starting to build a little bit of traffic on fifty east of the freeway\nHudson droid Norwood usual slowdown spots fifty ...

you're actually raising your kids and build a better mouse trap or apps\nOr where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics is a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left um they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they

going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and are there is no anti ... hair and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with\nThinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it\nWas shared content ...\nThere was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our\nMedia as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for a viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them [noise]\nSo what he is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually comeback to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... or ... I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we\nBelieve in law go day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God\nWith eternal souls and with dignity that's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people\nAre not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless\nWe can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about with deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben\nSasse his new

rights law thousands of Central American migrants are continuing their Mars through Mexico in bed to seek asylum\nOf the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually a national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of not\nBacking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty I've got thirty seconds

of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty\nPursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal\nI'd hang of it before it surely start let's start with me I should go into education\nAbsolutely on them and talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're nice testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy satellites testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and almost I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about it really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write\nSurvive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts did a good job somehow that worked out of the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready so nice testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators\nGo away and then it shows while riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that sixty two counties across all city to\nGet the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers the average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among\nYou dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve many K through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids is\nJim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is their teeth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college was terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is when people show up at the clock in the morning so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great hospital\nAnd then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that the biology chemistry history or whatever right off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no word on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who them and go back to the gate sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory data okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to the degree why should they be bored in school and they should be one school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to be a trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty\n... that's a problem I let my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in the ocean to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people imagine if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss lowering it means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learned that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth

much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going day well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what bank love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two
