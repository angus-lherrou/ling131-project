[noise]\nI guess maybe I should have taken on my doctor back in the white jacket or for that amount of hugging a much\nTo do I'm Still I still have to do in my care after uh doing a power our was to to\nTo ah to just to to be able to see is he capable of being president or um you know or or Supreme Court nominee in the future after drinking six beers as Brock Obama said he used to before he went to college now Bill O'Reilly is here hello bill\n[noise] back how you doing\nI'm I'm I'm good I don't well how do you think this Kavanaugh thing's gonna come down\nI think it will be confirmed um tomorrow afternoon um\nGot as much as I said there's like the forty at this time but I I think he's going to be very hard at the ... this last a gap\nFor any Republican vote against them because there's new information and I don't know whether you guys know the new information because the media is not reporting it including Fox News in the wall street\nJournal I'm Dr Ford's people that includes her lawyers and uh her advisors or tried to get a woman named illegal in Keizer to change her testimony that isn't the FBI report apparently\n... was the best friend to Christine Ford when this incident like about Cabot allegedly took place and was named by Ford as an eye witness keys are all along and said I don't remember anything like this I don't even know judge Kavanaugh\nWill now the journals reporting\nThat a forge people and they name a woman Monica McLean texted keys or and said hey you got to change your testimony you gotta help Christine that's a huge story\nWell they're enormous store\nThere is also another story um that are in the FBI testimony that it shows the leak came from Chuck Schumer that it was Chuck Schumer's office in cahoots with one of the beach ladies that Ford or talked about\nYeah well I don't think there's any doubt about Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein at this point that they are corrupt\nSo bill should there be more than one language\nMonica McLean by the way this was the woman who Ford's ex boyfriend told the Senate Judiciary committee that Ford try to help her get through a lie detector test\nYeah because she was applying for a job at the FBI now bolsters the ex boyfriends um account now this may seem in the weeds but if the Judiciary Committee and I I Believe rationally may do this I Hope so\nHe could hall monitor ... Monica ... uh and uh others in affords camp in front of the committee and he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if that happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should should to here's here's the\nAnybody capital allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this\nTour the country apart and what if this was coordinated it ... and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who was involved you know there was one guy who or what was it su he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he ... he's been drinking this morning bill [laughter] wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] oh you have him arrested yeah he'll I like to be drunk for all of your interviews if that's OK rights to manage it better state\nFor you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true that's fair so I'm a ... there's there's one guy who came out and level the accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but look when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a ... yes this week say\nIt doesn't matter\nIf individual men get crushed it\nDoesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're in that zone and we've discussed this before you're into ...\nYou are now we don't care\nYeah you know if some guy didn't do something like ... whoever it may be and and and you get it and your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to\nPay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation is what matters is\nIs communal justice\nLeaving it it is that other people are talking\nAbout in the media will never report on is it the same people that organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators\nAbout cabin on the same outfits are doing it move on leaves the league right they've got the mailing list\nThey've got all the information I mean I'm sitting\nThere going deja vu yeah same people so now in addition to insanity like Alissa mulatto individual insanity then you have an organized coordinated effort with tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others okay or Oregon\nI sing sending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically the process and Americans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because this report it\nWill I Will tell you I listen to that stupid New York times podcast they listen to it every day just to hear what you know what's been they're putting on it uh and it it was a it might it made my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy\nButton one of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary they're very scary for\nAnd he could be on the phone high right\nRight and they could make an exception I think but you're right\nOkay what else I'm All right well she's believe me I Know on that I thought were going\nThat says if you want me to give you so\nNow we got into the ... give us two minutes not an honor killing the assets\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very\nI I read your life yeah she's on me which is obviously but she loved me and thought I was good so you didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not\nUm you know people walking in the schools and gunning down kids uh clerics are abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it's centered on evil\nAnd so I wrote ss with an eye on explaining to the reader\nThat these concentration camp guards and the people who kill babies and gassed innocent people were farmers and merchants and and bankers they weren't anything trained to do this you weren't assassins they were regular\nPeople and once the war started they put on their black uniform would the debt said insignia and went into the most horrible things that history has ever seen\nIn the book is better than his explanation or\nKill them comes out Tuesday\n... news

you had to say the most profane disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but it into does anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up in individual\nActually felt yeah that's the only thing left shocking you really are feeling and want\nTo say but you don't as I I Can't believe you said that yeah oh yeah well I have a joke at my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down

is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some not bright sunlight\nActually had some of the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like if if if we can notch him down\nI feel like that's why the tabloids exist\nThat's what I mean what are the outrage exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening no okay I Am [laughter] you know they they're like

c._e._o. see you'll be down here and him be up here is not sit well with people so if we can somehow\nExpose them as a human and that's what I said in my act for a long to every scandal that ever comes out past their politics athlete that headline should be person acts like human mhm right\nYeah well about ... ... well some of them [laughter] some of them aren't related I mean I oh yeah oh you he was drinking after a long day America yeah\nYeah I got to get that yeah that makes sense yeah or like our he\nYou know is the kind of the thing I don't want to get into politics our guys but on the thing with Kavanaugh was agree or disagree on how it goes or whatever\nPeople who said I Can't believe he was angry\nYou rely on January ... you can't you know there's no human on the planet now that you wouldn't go okay enough\nOkay yeah we were like ... there's there's no avenue for like defense he now like yeah like people with somebody came after us the ugly we have jokes about kids with like allergies\nAnd we kind of like make fun of other guys laugh come on [laughter] wow after ... years ago\nThey used to be like back in the day you know like you know like my dad knew how to like tile

numbers I've seen them they're huge yeah they are in it yeah they show it really is it really is into who could be more surprised than all of us but\nThen you get you know who's also doing really well\nA fat so fat so yeah what I'm doing well um you know fat the podcasts yeah the fat with Jeff\nFisher is like I Know it would be all like jeopardy people love Jaffe and ... to us because we hate him\nWe like ... him I Know I had to write a and so I had to write a memo to all of the you know producers and everybody involved in team fat and ah and I was like I'm nobody can be more surprised than me\n... ruin bad guy but yeah it's a you know it out in the ... really impressive\nAll right so a pack ray from pat gray unleash welcome to the program glad you're here\nI'm Glad to be here to argue this yeah yeah I I'm a I'm a it's\nA forty or fifty one forty nine Kavanaugh so they will vote tomorrow however there is one vote for the Republican side that is going away\nAnd I'd love to get first your gut reaction and then let's talk about it okay because my gut reaction was clear and then thinking about it I'm like well now wait a minute\nYou're a Republican senator you are a you're going to vote for Kavanaugh is this close\nYet your daughter is getting married on Saturday ... view cannot cast your vote in any other way you have to be there your across the country so it's one or the other my gut was see America I'm with my daughter\nYeah right I mean yes okay now let's think about this ... you are because this is a senator Danes yeah promote Montana okay so senator Danes from Montana he's been elected by his people to represent them\nEither this is one of the most important in game changing votes or of maybe his lifetime\nOr it will if if the Republican if the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left you can do this to anybody\n...\nHow do you ... 'cause my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could\nReconcile that oh well\nIt depends on do they still wanted to vote without his they may not or if they're fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to probably ... ...\nWell no well yeah I mean it but again let's say mentioned switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so\nLet's say ... signifies today or that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow so instead it forty nine forty now that it's not a sure thing you need ...\nI I got to say like my ... inch of hardware that your gun was titled what my daughter but you know and the end you you really think that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think if my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screwed this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't put your family can that can be move for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it's sick started at three and I'll be there\nBut the ... vote right like move the vote you know they're all they're planning on doing by the way if they need Danes are going to delayed Ollie until he comes back oh jeez delayed the vote well only if they need them right now that doesn't look like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy\nThing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow to no no they can relate to it on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday\nBut there's a risk of like you know some new accusation during the crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "05"}
