crying and are you better today than you were yesterday have you found\nAny answers or are you only shouting\nThings down or you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights mean where do your rights even come from\nToday I saw I think progress write a whole article about how the constitution has failed that was a headline the constitution has failed\nAnd then it goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document and the three fifths in the constitution all lies all lies\n\nNow you can argue that or we can begin to teach our children you can argue that\nAnd you can throw it back in their face with some sort of habitat or\n\nName calling of some sort\n\nHere's the question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad that requires real thought and discussion because\nIt is neither in my opinion is both it has been a force for bad and I warn you\nIf we leave the bill of rights we will become the darkest force ever on earth with our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people\nWe free the blacks and we fought for it we fought and

still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past\nLet's talk about\nThe future we have never ever\nReached the heights demanded by our mission statement\n\nBut have we gotten better is it still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self\nEvident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nDo you have\nDo you have everything the baby lane next to you has when you were born\n\nAs far as human rights and dignity\nDo you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well or not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's drives and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw God into it I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than manned\nThe reason why the creator is important is if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away rights\nSo if you want to see them the turn of the ... the great cause the most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doused each of us with certain\nAn changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more\nAnd that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this as an\nAspirational statement we're only talking about the past we're talking about the mistakes of the past you cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying where we're going\nSo where are we going to fall\nYou want to terrorists down there now I read your website I rejoin mission statement I strongly disagree capitalism is not the problem\nCapitalism that is it that has no moral sentiment is but you don't fix that by a state run economy\nBy co ops it's always fails no you\nAnd your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer a means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do\nAs was told to me by a very powerful individual once looked blend we all believe in the constitution but you know you gotta do what you gotta do no\nNo\nYou do not to do what you have to do that to the ends justify the means we either believe in this or we do not and that is the question America do you believe\nNeutral half assed\nNot sought out sitting on the sidelines all of those answers I mean nothing in the end\nOnly those who know it who understand it who have done their homework who can intellectually defend it\n\nThose are the winter soldiers those will be the ones that restore freedom for all mankind\nEverything else is lip service the game and actually a tool\nIn the hands of those who wish to create chaos and destroy all we have\nAn\nAunt that monologue\nAnd so much more is actually the beginning of part three of my uh book addicted to outrage finding our lunar them what is our purpose anymore rather talk about that with you and those who have read the book if you've read the book\nCow or we have a lot of people uh let me go to a let me go to\nA Scotland in Nevada hello Scotland\nHello Glen\nI'm I just wanted to say that we can be outraged about anything so what we need to do is to turn that negative and positive actions like when President Kennedy challenged America that you get to the moon we need to turn or negative thoughts and chew the positive thoughts\nWell I don't think it's ever been easier do you I mean we're just ignoring all of the positives that are happening to us I mean you know what a moon shot OK you learn ... going to Mars twenty twenty five\nI mean what's bigger than that it's just not a national project do we do we need to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future\nBecause that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can doing the hard things not the easy things I mean that that was just that was the whole goal and it did galvanized people thanks Scotland you know what people don't think about is\nNineteen sixty eight is when we went to the moon\nSame years Woodstock\nMhm wow yes we are weird yeah so you were either rolling around in the mud or\nYou are reaching for the stars there were two Americas well\nWhere is the America that is reaching for the stars where is that America that says no not gonna stop me\nI I I ah\nI saw post today or that I that I had to answer\nA in my Twitter feed let me see if I can find it real quick um\nThat was ... it's actually this is so wrong what is being taught to children into it to everybody um there was a a person Helen plot grows and apparently fat\nIs my identity and I belong to it whether I'm aware of it or not and even if I'm not this is what I've known for and I'm kidding myself to think people actually think of me primarily as a writer and speaker rather than a fat\nPerson imagine living that way I ...\nI responded ah ah\nTo that as a growing member of the fat community\nI find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body I Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your loss what you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you\nSo which are we going to be America because the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this\nWho are we\nAre we the people that role in the mud and are constantly looking down and ... basing ourselves\nOr we

what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really that the opposition to the people leading the leadership for the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party\nAnd what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there out a party members they work every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media\nAnd being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a poll or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nUh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and ... year people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and\nBoth sides suck while they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seen their side being unreasonable violence if you see ...\nThe way to answer ... is not with uh the\nMilitant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets that is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and\nYou don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer a A R a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running

you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need at least on the conversation about\n... of it yeah and I you know I think we need to be careful about even I'm considering\nThe I I think that there really is a fear over a I to try to come in and ... that's that's it yeah it's I think that they want to push that starts socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical or a nomination in ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their ... their problem correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's

understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news

about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but

history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started

me and help me find an answer and we did we\nFound an answer but it wasn't at all when I thought it would be the answer as it turns out to my complete surprise he's a single digit number [noise]\nA number that was hastily written on a ... posted belt and passed over to me with a handful of others as part of a kind of warm up exercises the seven were just sitting down to begin our conversation as you hear me read all the numbers down to the group several weeks\nAgo three ten pet or why why\nKeep in mind one of them is our answer forward\nLet me start by telling you about the seven\nI Am and the high school teacher a mother of three boys three teenage boy I Am a entire instructor\nI was a police officer in Arlington policemen Virginia for thirty seven years\nI've wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find the older that I get the more progressive and liberal but I become I Am very much on on the side I always vote for the first thing that scares me to\nEven wanted their experiences and feelings about guns to be different\nBy herself yeah shot down in the closet tens or not he had a shot down I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our home they're locked out I've never seen them I don't want to say that ... started shooting I just asked my dad and his redneck buddies out in the country\nThese seven words thoughtful well informed good hearted people who all agreed to spend an entire evening talking to people they didn't even know\nWhy to come up with a list and I wanted to find a link even if it was a very short one specific practical things that we could all agree upon to help combat this intangible threat to our kids that we all think from time to time an intangible threat that a ...\nA teacher in the room explain from the perspective of being inside the schools each and every day\nAnd any time there is any sort of anything other than where I'm at school and the kids get weird they get that in just a feeling among the entire school\nThat something had fully wrong and I think it all over the country I think that you hear and noise in the hallway when you're ISIS quiet and everyone had turned\nWith that awareness we began talking\nStory of that conversation has two parts the content that dumped up with that and then the impact what happened because of what was said so content as we searched for the list for almost four hours\nI'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was ...\nDuring remember same children\nSame goal\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize that in this age an unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation\nListened to the following exchange between two mothers Anna a progressive and Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives that brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear and\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restriction on myself and it's kind of and I'm not going to cut you off but this is kind of a bank at Penn and play\nThere are reasonable ideas we can come up with that ... going to inconvenienced\nBy and you're right there are probably solutions there and your reasonable but that the leaders and the movement or not reasonable that that ... is that when there's a school shooting last shooting someplace the first thing here\nWhen a gun control and the n._r._a. has had\n\nSo many other opinions and voiced his most of them extreme jumped right into our conversation on mid thirty nine and everything was heightened from the get go [noise]\nDenise or firearms instructor who almost missed a round table because she had food poisoning speaks about the problem with letting other people speak for on\nThey inflammatory temper you know agitator that are being the talking heads on the media is thinking ... thing for me they don't represent ... that kind of craziness\nDoes not represent me and I would like to think that you know when I say the ultra liberal you know screaming about all that stuff and calling\nPeople like me and gotten nuts and all that I Would like to think that that's not representative of eh so how do we solve that problem with getting the papal from stopping the ones that are out there trying to send a message because for me I think it's the wrong one and it's not productive\nI became aware very quickly that it's almost impossible to have a productive conversation with so many other voices reference to repeat it how can I get each person just to speak with them so\nBut it would take a while\n\nSo let me tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's American financing do is use American financing\nAnd um because he's motor lying and saying uh\nShe uh ... who did you get it for ... you get your loan finally from Vito\nIs that all you got it from a vetoes cousin vetoes ... not to be named yeah 'cause ah who got a little\nLike okay they are what are you give me nothing dial\nUp but if you don't pay I take your children there's some children and I do lose my knee caps right but ... says American financing I mean this is the kind of people they are they looked at what what he was suggesting and they were like a no no bank will do that and know that well\nAnd when he founded another bank he he called them up they gave him advice and said hey you know worrying about this and this this\nBut in the end they said if you can get that deal and you're comfortable with it go ahead go ahead there's right so they're not trying to jam you into something they don't need to sell you a loan and that's what's happening the banks don't give you a loan they're selling it to you\nThese people do not work on

Ninety nine dollars to order\nI Know from my side is you know reaching out to my legislators and I think this is what I Want and if the legislators refuse to take action and helping to elect people well or more in line with that thought and perhaps on your side you can get a fair but we all have a part to plant and first is\nMaking our voices heard it might be seeing a child but that's one that we can okay\nBut we are at an event one that I Can't find the right word\nOne heck one step back and started a community level instead of relying on our legislators to fix this problem so you go into the schools and you say the price of all I'm a retired Marine\nAnd my two kids go to the school and I really want to help keep building secure I didn't at all I can do I can only work within the confines of my life and my time but I'm a parent\nHere I have expertise I Want to do something how can we gather the parents in this school to help for to find a bill I think they're probably they're selling a restriction than issues again I mean I don't know I'm not involved in it or or um but\nTwo approaches boats don't valid and worthwhile to me but in that moment it felt very either or\nAnd the little dismissive\nAnd this happened a lunch jumping back\nAnd forth between opposing ideas\nAs opposed to spending time discussing integrating them or combining the approaches and I just hope that the divide over the first approach the constant fight over a ... day doesn't demonize up so much that we aren't able to work together on the second community level approach we need books not only the ruler\nSo those three impediments opinions out numbering people not tearing all the options and either or thinking we're our biggest obstacles and research together for my list\nAnd as we talked we I guess as the they have to be that they are getting louder health and talk [noise] yeah I\nI got a lot of danger\nWe just kept running up against them but then also you can also well they ... the child\nAnd never got around them there\nThat he could then use to act out\nAnd finished you know in in the ... hour after hour it was tense defensive and haunt the air conditioning wasn't working in my premise wasn't working\nAnd I feel like that's what happens a lot both eyes every every time somebody give an example of why that example my son works for them to physically and then\nThey turn into a different conversation [noise] stupid lift was only making us more frustrated the more we couldn't find it because although there were so many moments connection it was a moment of disconnect that controlled the mood of the road [noise]\nWe already have laws on that we do not we do not there are going to only five thousand of them I Would run again let us all of those going there is a ...

us were feeling\nComing in hair I\nI thought our chances of getting at lists together with with I was more optimistic\nAnd I see why would we are where we are today and it says that sort of

create this environment with the seven of us that we can\nGo past that we'll we'll know each other you're all good people and I could not believe that with all that ... of them coming in that the the

I ... couldn't get out of bed and when I looked at my phone there was this flurry of text and email from other people in the room saying how deeply miss we all tried we missed so did you find out\nWell what was interesting with one of the tax was an invitation from Denise star firearms instructor to to Anna\nAre progressive activists mother saying you want to continue the conversation why don't you come down to the shooting range and we can and\nSo I can beat this and Anna accepted in a second I'm shocked and so the next day is progressive activists went to the shooting range at the base of being a raise building to continue the conversation with the firearms trainer and that's where we go now\nFirst and then take out an air to think OK okay\nAnd and I'm also going to start off on a twenty two semiautomatic handgun very\nOK then as I say someone nervously watch them engage each other woman won the memory of their direction from not even forty dollars prior was still pretty fresh [noise]\nThe car and I care and says hey I\nI got a lot of the house\nThey began this new conversation with basic [noise]\nSo how do you take the safety off because they keep the safety on and then it had it ... it depends on the specific type of\nFire says this one\nAnd then they started talking more specifics of the art is Denise explaining some of the existing gun laws that don't make sense\nThat if someone were to hold this like this and turned up against their shoulder and we are now shooting at like\nOf the law and you're technically a\nFelon why would there be an issue if you're holding it as a rifle why why why would it be considered illegal\nBecause now the the um one of the pieces and not registered as a rifle you didn't purchase ... says he purchased it as a pistol and now you're shooting at as a rifle they're saying\nYou're in violation of law\nComplete makes absolutely no sanctions\nAnd then this happened and they were talking about bullet\nStrangling much larger bullet tongues more powder that says a trio and so that's a typical hunting around [noise] so you can just see that the different than the power and penetration to train them bullets and the amount of powder that goes in\nThe ...
