because we have somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else about a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important that we keep it to entered she now that you moved accuse she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standard that the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should not be a professor even be allowed to work at a fast food restaurant I don't think so how can you how can you possibly believe a liar on anything she says\nYou want this

king it was against tyranny and it was for certain ideas like the idea that you were innocent until proven guilty\n\nWe are fighting post modernism and until the American people understand what post modern ism is you will lose\nYou will lose every battle because you will only grow frustrated and angry which will play directly into what they want to happen\nThey want us at each other's throats

Fox News at a rally in Mississippi he mocked Brett Kavanaugh's first accuser poking fun at Christine Blasey Ford's hazy recollection of some of the events the night she claims to Supreme Court nominee try to rape or\nWhen you buy a book on Kindle do you own the book\nWhen you buy a movie for my tunes do you own the movie\nThe answer is no\nThe end of ownership\nAaron and I want to get this right Paris or say for\nMe to ask them to tell me how he feels name it's ... percent ... guy how there was a lot easier than it than at low we can't pronounce the easy word yeah it was going to be together as a more than ... there's a lot of confidence there I don't know how you doing there and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future and a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people leaving on cars I mean it's just it's just all changing\nBut do we really own things when we buy them on line\nSo I think there's a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things in digital goes ah especially digital books movies music they go into the transactions assuming they work the same way they do in the in the world is tangible goods\nWhere if you buy a book you can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will or in the future and leave your book collection or to or your loved ones\nAnd the rules that control these digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or for my shows are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a real disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a quick example I'm just [noise] um\nA couple of weeks ago I'm a consumer uh a customer of the apple ... a movie store found that three movies or to purchase had that we had been deleted from his account there were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted\nBoth off of people's candles yams including\nA ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter]\nSo these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to really sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's\nEasier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nUh and I read so much I read it all and tend to all but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because he watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that every copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concern or from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history\nIf these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands of\nYou know the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThan there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to um to to uh to archive and preserves [noise] um do these works\nIn an air and it was the movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most\nRecent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described um the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires they no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decides that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise]\nUm [noise] oh my gosh so they almost a force you to I mean because they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and the you know fully restored but you still\nHad the old copy now that's right you can't ... I mean even for I mean think of this even just for comparison you can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed in our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their advice\nUm and and this is this a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally many services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own sort of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their\n... servers exactly I'm Sorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded if something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\n... so\nThat allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut because the Kindle is tethered through soft where right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files strong\nIs laughable ... you're talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly\nThe bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou ... it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they're constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk of but a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick\nBreak and they will come back and get you to answer that question a and just the change\nIn in capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor four years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh ...\nWell I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's really good [laughter] I'm ... and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can well okay so I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver\nUm there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's going to happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean\nThere if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of worked together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this\nThis bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and uh you can have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also do it in gold and it's all made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold line\nJust look at the numbers find out for yourself is the world hurtling towards a fiscal sanity or insanity\nAs soon as a star start rolling the other direction I'll stop talking about this but I don't trust that we have anything that's going to go into um bring us back into sanity other than some sort of catastrophic event gold line called them now find out if it's\nPretty heavy gusts through there that could grow was the day rolls are we do have some a range ours is a a bit of a

even now you buy things on line\nSometimes you're not actually buying them you're just renting them you're entering an ongoing relationship\nWhat does this mean for um society how is this going to change us we'll it's even change the way we view things and and change some fundamental or concepts of what it means here in America of individual rights\nWearing a ... on with is professor of law and I'm\nThe author of the book what we buy when we buy now and you can find more information at the end of ownership dotcom\nEra and so tell me what how you've been looking at this\nSo I think in the short term we're likely to see more changes in the way our commercial interactions occur in the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured rules were going to start to see people become more and more accustomed to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways\nI I think that makes some degree of sense there are some people for whom owning a car is it necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of car share application and I think\nThat makes a lot of sense what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from independent control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies that control access\nSo ... maybe may I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not going to and we're not going to support that or we want to discontinue or whatever\nI I um I Do I have a heap of junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up and the motor vehicle contacts or the ... the way it come up um [noise] uh most most recently and most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the long a run in American foreign equipment company makes exactly this argument that they own the software in the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop or you know farming repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing force to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote settle you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\nI I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being creative discourages people from\nUm from as he said seem dream with the same as if they are and we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made a over the centuries in this country that didn't come from giant\n... D departments they came from individuals messing around with things that down in their\nGarage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities\nBut even even more broadly at 'em if we're discouraged and thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world and I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in\nEvery hour five after some towns and on the maybe the biggest casualty of away from the radio history with your share of over a quarter of a million bucks\nA thousand dollar pay day he's here on the news dot five Ninety Days yes or\nWhere you were daredevils go to\nOur white they get into [noise]\n\nBecause they may qualify for free or low cost health insurance through medicating share\nEven if you apply for your kids could still be eligible for Dr intend to visit prescriptions and\nTake your kids to cover today\nGo to ensure kids now down got a call one eight seven seven kids now\nFor my seventeenth birthday I lost my sister a mom to cancer and then I got a\nThirty weeks of chemotherapy in several surgeries to remove the tumor hair my damaged\nThanks to my children's American network hospital I'm cancer free\nNow studying to become a pediatric oncology nurse and I never did it didn't marathon at my university now my local children's mental\nHealth kids live their dreams\nWhen your money where the miracles aren't\nGiving to your children's miracle network [noise]\nIf you're looking to visit a hall of fame and see the legends of sport you don't have to travel across the country we have one right here in Oklahoma come visit the national wrestling hall of fame in museum in Stillwater, Oklahoma\nTo see the history of the world's\nSports memorabilia champions from all levels and honor east from ... chapters across the country\nMore information visit ...

up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that\nIt's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kevin ... and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seeing that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country\nGoogle searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very uh you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's a real problem\nYou're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive if you and I are having a ...\nRaymond about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way of fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus\nAnd and and Hillary arm wrestling probably not going to convince you voted different wet I wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter] but you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good\nAt it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last
