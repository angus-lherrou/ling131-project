[noise]\nPackages number age at nine nine Dave Anthony Fox News found this morning police in Delaware just intercepted one mailed it for a vice president Biden looking very slow it all the other ones are the Democrats another turned up at five AM in New York City\nNone of them have gone off and you took the time to print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath it\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get her\nDone except none of your bombs get it done none\nThey they've had zero chance of making it through security screening\nAnd Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go this dam road runner keeps go getting away\nMaybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not designed to kill\nBut to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who saw screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other this however\nIs not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's a wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rent\nRick that pushes his supporters in that direction you know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a\nLeft wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\n\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business and Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one\nTo deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapist to bring this memory back at it so long ago\n\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent to the\nWhite House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happen\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old\nWere you in twenty Seventeen he barely remember was I walking at that time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote\nFor those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate if you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on anything everything is speculation and if I Would say already ... versus all left wing person dried Iran for everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that\nAnd something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\n\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny called credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat these Jason how ridiculous is this bomb\nThe most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I when we first looked at it I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder\nAnd um I I was looking at it and I was like no not really\nI mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the\nShrapnel was what's dangerous than a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\n[laughter] [laughter] right [noise] um\nBut there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work right\nIt had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time in some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN on media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to\nThe coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels sophistication\nBecause he had vent or or she by the way he or she had a had sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and read that in\n... where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely\nBe school until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and her fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from a [laughter] get the paper and the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they did have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or sort service at their home right\nThey get older male you you have private security you don't get your don't like we never opened our mailbox I remember one time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox scary\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there are words matter does far they have shown no comprehension of that that is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't know like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence\nNo evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fit into these bombings we have no idea\nHave no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political motive but that's a ...\nA political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who was mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you\nPut that on there and why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope glad I'm Glad none of them went off by the way um but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we've just talked about\nA no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and da da da da Silva says not an\nExact science and you can't they often to point to our right or wrong timing\nTo you could've blown up the post in it so that there was a photo time or it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny is the wires are

I don't know\nI mean you have to have some level of skepticism of the of the of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you leap to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you to be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing ... figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think if someone who was opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWhy did someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened to a hundred times unbelievably when someone just listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you see these statement that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe rights and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think of ... [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America you will that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need\nTo lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to\nGo to relieve factor dot com [noise] joined a\nReturn every Saturday and eight thirty for the senior living today show show about ... years for seniors and he'll come topics relating to hell\nIndependent and overall wellbeing of seniors right here in southern Colorado\nIn your living today's visiting and other senior living today show with David ...

on her for some of those\nAre things that she said which is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between

more\nAt NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to

gone that's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damned those remarks\nThere is no place on our air or in this work place for those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I added that quote it's very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive\nCry babies who take offense at the slightest\nThing and you know what I don't even think it's America I don't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think\nThat it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that\nAre cry babies they're sick of this\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics\nAnd the last place probably the last comes first academia [laughter]\nOh you should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not we are the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains in in a um a in a ... a wagon train okay\nIs she was she looks like me in a dress with a bomb it okay she she ... she'd also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\n[laughter] you know she did she wiped her face and ...\nAnd kept going she didn't wine gene cry about it she's like oh crap [noise] shouldn't around with that\nI poked my eye out\nAnd she moved on\n\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on yes people say things that I don't like we move on and yes\nThings have changed were involving we're learning new things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\nMegan Kelly ought to know that blackface is awful yes\nIt's no longer acceptable but you know what\nIf it's a costume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black faces done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... being fired not because she wore black face but because of words\nAnd I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong at\nThat person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\n\nI think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want another whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me\nHow are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist\nIf she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nThis is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sort of there's something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen\nWith what Twitter and here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind of world we want to end up in unfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is exactly the world we're creating\n[noise]\nAll right I

they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it but\nFor her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny and Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up what after like getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know then the animation but it's still the same types of things happen\nBecause they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is that he he's that they're not trying to be racist or not starting Chinese say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good but the child for example who think they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd the only time they mix right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we may say\nAs a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we are not adults if we can handle that level of conversation Mm\nGlenn

and all these other alternative forms of comedy and uh you know Michael Moore as it is you're not really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd as a okay so ... so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything can\nBe said for uh the fact that ah this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore\nIt's this is\nNot you know he was\nAnd we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there's no scarcity value what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of pathetic moment at the end of star nine eleven nine\nWhere he does is Hitler montage instruments that Trump is like Hitler and it's like if you're into playing the speech the Trump inhaler and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler the last for about three years is like is the last one to the Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of ... where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talked about with Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that policy and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where\nWe look at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left pointing that out\nThat we're calling for an end of capitalism\nI mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know where socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an end to capitalism and they're still getting elected\n\nRead like Mars in a in a leader of the parade for a while but now he's kind of ... and ... it's ... it's kind of gotten ahead of them because this movie um\nCapitalism a love story with uh the communist uh at them you see the Soviet Nashville has some ... and that kind of thing is it's not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does that say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time\nWas seemed like Gehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff\nThey should stay away from a abolish ice they should stay away from the Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls and as a Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest positions in the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it is this strong\nA and it's only because I think of the Democrats moving so far left agree ... thank you so much Kyle Smith a critic at large for National

is about the caravan this election is about\nUm ah shutting people up this election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles set for if if you think that the caravan is not something you should worry about\nWhat's wrong with you if you're not worried about the economy and the effects of the budget and tax cuts um what's wrong with you you just don't see it or\nAre you is your philosophy sill upside down from traditional American or economics and philosophies that
