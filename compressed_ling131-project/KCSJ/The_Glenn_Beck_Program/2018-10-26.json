was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refused to say anything\nAbout it the crazy thing is today\nThe craziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is\nCalling us fake news yeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting

publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is what you know just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta and while\nThis is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelists imagine Trump's next chapter\nFive novel lists imagined Trump's next chapter the main image at the\nOf this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelist had one assignment\nRight out what you think happens after the Mueller investigation is

you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come into the prize\nAnd they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence I don't know what's what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's got to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable how is it the two hundred\nJournalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the

disagree they will chase you out of the public square\nThey have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand yes there's little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation because I have\nCalled these people I have talked to these people\nI have gone to them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need\nTo understand how half the country feels just have a conversation\nYou're making a huge error and yes I made all these airs oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now there are quite literally making it up what's the difference between a

those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nHere's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[laughter]\nTry to tell her twenty thicker and back or program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point in the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the

as violence\nLike your your your your ... coming after I was right I Can't go there yet they can't I Can't I got to take a break I Can't go there yet I Can't I Know where you're going and boy does it need to be said I Can't do it yet cat\nCan you needed to do the right I just crank that was that we are now he thinks that's it again I'd been telling you for years to get to your alcohol if we can reignite that it's going to be a good ratings most\nTime can I tell you something the blackouts I Need the blackout right now I Need them so desperate alright it would be so grades I forgot about everything that they said that was so stupid yesterday [laughter] I don't even recall it at all I Love that idea\nI Need to take a break first let me tell you about car shield car shield is uh is is going to save you from a lot of trouble they're going to save you from taking your car in and\nYou've got something wrong with it or even an oil change and then it comes out and they're like are going to miss some bad news for you and we found some extra stuff and it's going to cost and you're like what look\nThese are surprises that nobody wants and everybody gets but if you have car shield you don't have to worry about it if your car breaks down after the warranty expires you could be out of pocket for thousands of dollars just to get it fixed but if you have car shield\nChances are you're not going to have to come out of pocket for anything\nThat if you if you want to take your car into your favorite mechanic or the dealership usually people go to the dealership [noise]\nUh I mean what lately to put it this way why do you avoid the dealership after your warranty expires you avoid it because you can maybe get it done cheaper a by your favorite mechanic and maybe he's not using you know the same parts or whatever you'd have a fix by the dealership\nWarranty expires if you have car she'll no problem\nIt at an alarm you know what one hundred percent survive ability so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they wanted to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually want to\nKill they want to do that if they pull you want to know when you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong totally horrible despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like my mom\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of it on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend on doing they don't intend on a you know he felt that that happened to for example Dana lash right like have to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often in ... and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would\nExecute a terrorist attack on on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I ... it is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens\nHowever obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending these things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make me big media circus you things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work in a really all that all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the rice dog fire and um I don't know

bring out the dancing bear\nThat's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but\nWas very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their arms video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very blunt and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what\nHis choice what if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah you know liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that\nBut he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him and the reason he has it been is because he gives them no quarter yes he fights back\nBut now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back like Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if not fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament\nOh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it when we see it and we're not responsible for any of it all in all ... us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch that so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh how much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times\nLiterally paragraph thirty five in the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened that from the job of course they're cartoon bombs they are leaving it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is ... there was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worst bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press we're gonna send these ... all of the all of the enemies of the right ... obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do we how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that is why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly ... how would the press handle what I think that they would um\nLook you have to understand it every morning out of the ah Washington DC think tanks progressing think tanks they send stuff to Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this uh may be the person sending it was insane ah you know that kinda thing they'll never say\nWell gee maybe um our side is so craves now that we have to criticize our side you're never going to see that ever\n[noise]

own show uh the guy in Virginia didn't he have a van to\nI thought he was\nLiving in his van or something wasn't even yeah it's I think you're right yes he was because he went to um he he would be that the YMCA the local YMCA so when the shooting happened they knew where he was and they knew who he was because he was very he he was living in another state\nAnd drove there should basically camped out there and prepare for the shooting right\nHe was he was a Bernie Sanders guy a big big big big big big big big crazy big Bernie Sanders guy and he was living in his man\nI mean it's going to be interesting to see I think there's several distinctions to several additional levels to this let's say we find out that this is exactly what is it is the person it is is banned these are pro Trump stickers whatever I mean we don't know any of those things for sure yet\nUh but if we find that out to be an interesting distinction to see if he is the ... he's either a very incompetent\nLunatic who tried to blow up\nPeople and failed hang on more away hold on I Want more than a or he's a a lunatic who ah was just try to scare\nPeople did not intend to kill people that will be an ... a distinction that will be interesting in the investigation\nDid you see is an idea yeah OK I'm going to guess incompetent\n[laughter] get get sick of it too because of a man like that you know if you're thinking I'm going to put his sticker on my ... my bag 'cause I Want people to know and maybe it'll change their heart maybe it'll change their mind\nYet that bans and not that bad
