com\nNow return you to this morning Americas first used with Gordon di di di di case yes J. well below\nAnd I are radio station [noise]\nBoss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy in paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some there is and I think their case would\nBe or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be a you know things are so bad so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's\nPretty much the opposite like a lot\nTo say that we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who step and walking at the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told this story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant pond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey dad I'm just I'm going to walk down to the\nPond like alone [laughter] without your brother [laughter]\nWhat do you stop and think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey\nWhy don't you walk to Honduras with a group of people that I don't know [laughter] look\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there in certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to get the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone is a four year old who came across the border right in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story a and\nYou just want her first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like this if it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa that's it\nYou know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from uh people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right and you know like any more thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border\nIt whether you like it or not feels like an invasion right\nIt feels like waiting does there just top like they're they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security they they're they're you're coming in or do the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course there just because they keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries to deal with this and yet\nOr the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nA war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody sneaks in from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then they some and they send back them they'd send back to them if they do it without permissions they send back them ... ... but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to us\nMexico has a pretty stiff immigration law\nA streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society they are of economic and social benefit to society way you're you expect your\nImmigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport I mean that's\nA daily racist right I mean like that is not yet so it's not an argument there\nWe would never know you can't do that you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think\nOf a warden Trump supporter who would have a ... a support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages\nOf white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add\nSomething to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mine bought that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's politically wanting to look at the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh Donald Trump and the people who are supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that saying hey used this use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe someone someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party I did hear at all talking\nAbout it in the debate or I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security that mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where I'm at Sally has I think a great chance of winning or people to get because her opponent there is like\nIf you took Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh young it's the lab of democracy she saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots in history in the air the air force incredibly accomplished yeah had a great chance of winning in a in a tough environment a ... in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know you're you basically have a coat pink worker a code pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and it\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be their number literally with go pick her entire I'm that rising her views I don't know exactly she yeah she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the\nPoint where again like she like co hosted a show with someone who's a nine eleven truther Wilder awhile\nThat's like it's crazy bonkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona as the border state the big deal there Texas is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but\nYeah I get a look at the other side of that yet with that though\nHe doesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even wants to border frankly now it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers\nUm for for his life um\nAnd and from day one in El Paso and and you know this and that gallon if you were born Robert or Albert or Gilbert ... your folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that I've gone a buyer for my entire life\nI'm born and raised in fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than ...

same way you can talk about better because that's actually not my ... my name's to deep\nUh in ...

I Hope we can get him back snack nailed down\nUm let's see we got burner burden in Texas Hi\nGood morning I'm having so much fun [noise] ... I have a twin brother named\n... bird as an adult he's calling Robert okay or that\nYou do you do get better okay now what is your background are you ah are you a boring white person or something that would be positive in our society\nWhere Americans of Mexican descent\nTown okay so ... when they need to know what she does know ... ... or I call myself an American an excellent dissent first of all the name\nMy name is bad though but I like to be called burger or get this\n... wow see okay so you're going to the other way you're going from ... to Bobby which is interesting is this kind of ties ideas\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called Bertha which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that they'll personally oh you do I where\nI used to work for the NBA no Paso is the secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started as a came in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt was when I came on a lot of my information because I knew what was going on stuff of crafting my desk and everything when I found out that a bad though\nWas running for Senate I knew he had used the veterans as a launching point and they need to them under the bus while we're uh\nTo get his name to get his name nationally known and by the way my call him personally myself I come in horse race [laughter]\nAttractive [laughter] calling Ganguly\nHe's got that I'm wearing Adam's apple and it sticks out for a long time um\nI don't want to seem like an angry Hispanic female mhm I Am just an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes embed them but he never agent and bring them in a native\n... and it's like ... and thank you for the call it just seemed like that there is a a a there is an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else these things are sensible right like a sensible that Barry Obama both bronco bummer\nRight here in its sensible in that world it sensible if you're Elizabeth Warren to claim you have Native American heritage and in in your school and and submit a recipe the powwow chow like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters right\nIf the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim then classifying yourself or as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there is a real incentive and motivation to do it and we keep we seem to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe he was called but it was a ... I don't know uh I it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he is put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him ... but if this is not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from you know his campaign Sarah stuff which that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit yeah I'm Irish American it I think I'm from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all he's trying to\nBe a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F. K. okay we'll know who the F. K. was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just stop trying to BBS ... you're not that he's working on it though\nIt's dry and these these dry and I mean battle is Beto Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson we'll [laughter]\nAnd it was a tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing a turn of events\nThere and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has gone on I I I just I don't I don't see how people don't see through this you know I and I think maybe on the left\nThey don't want to because they think he has a chance you know every few years\nThe to the left gets that terrible teeth or they get to get close in for in a few polls\nWendy Murphy is going to change Texas who's the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a oh a were you were to use them and when you were down there yeah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also going to change Texas\nEvery time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to it no longer we'll have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true\nAc try to ... generation trying to prove it one one thousand twenty\nYeah that's what made the left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our uh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor in these things and they they have\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that like\nI said as a you know say that you know\nThe libertarian side of me right I don't care what people say they are right like no difference to me she says she's Native American or not I don't care but we are there's an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black ... does that matter to me I don't what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to step truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that racial does all is white and the truth is the Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay [noise] you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only is the deputy politics the thick world we need to cure it\nGlenn Beck show on Web ... news dog five Ninety Casey is Jay\nShutout blends blog five tiny case yesterday dot

with\nYou got to see a pattern and have their little been Republican slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and fifty six was outlier most of the time is right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house wow\nAgain they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent and outs two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow or ... that the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race with these ah with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean that was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by your heart rate made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world\nUm but I mean he's he's raised this doesn't even clue Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate my son is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to ... racing and\nWhat's your what he wants more in the in the uh if you compare quarter last quarter\nOf the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCampaign that that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh\nNow it's funny in the Senate race record he broke\nWas the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick lousy it wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race\nIt was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win again ear to ear around fifty in almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five that's a ...\nAnd the other thing uh it's kind of interesting on the in the bat that if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days now and now we\nJust you know we have a\nGoing back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about the Senate as a little bit of there is a little bit of something there to be worried about I\nThink they're going to win the Senate I think you're in a sea of fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of seats oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas\nAre those who were in question ... I I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more\nI think it'll be like double digit I think that's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida in ... Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top I ended up on ... yeah well I saw it's called but um they pretty much a toss up race but those other I mean Florida is a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to\nAway for junior I mean I'm going to be talking about West Virginia here I think Joe mentioned uh probably sealed his ...\nElection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that as your brand they're all bumped all buck the system when I have to\nI don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you\nComplain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain\nAbout a summer cold Lisa Murkowski Joe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them all of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest\nConservative of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a craft or now communist again the socialist in communist yeah I mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake\nHere's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and buy or the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for him for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nBut you know again ... West Virginia is a state it's probably the most pro Trump\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I mentioned got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate or you\nKnow you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mentioned he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nAre but it is a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat you're you're at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one\nIt would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there is a good you know eighty percent chance that there I mean the most models are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven point a to the Republican Kevin Cramer so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my pursuit there I think honestly you had two races\nDecided by the cabinet vote one was mentioned Joe ... high camp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it and then she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said the double digits situation happens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and\nYou know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is what we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got in a democratic governor we've got a democratic senator and there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances would the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left figures\nAnd good for North Dakota in ... for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks\nThat way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic things Eric ... the dangers there as well I mean this is this going to be an interesting one and ... and not the thing that's really unfortunate is if if all that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now which\nIs you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly you lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and that's the thing they're going to be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which they'll find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it but other than that you're going to get any real advances are not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to have tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy\nAs long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah just just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah\nYeah it's not a problem to show you the house and how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're gonna say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know whether this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing 'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats can pick up eighty three seats\nNow to point one percent chance really unlikely like you say that that an absolute no it's not going to get to eighty three right ... ... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans to hold the same amount of seats they have now\nAnd if you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can consider cardio among the NBA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone\nAnd it fits in your pocket so you can take any ... any time anywhere to order ... cardio dot com and then you pay a R.
