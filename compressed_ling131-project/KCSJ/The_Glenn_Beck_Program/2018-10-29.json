them this is the story of the Jewish people just survive\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap of land they say was there as because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United

known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin could concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society is the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews\nBut people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nIs the answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization\nThat I'm mad man went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue story never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the

true\nYou know that would be easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had to really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just\nDid you guys watch the news all this we can't know as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news never my the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews can't or oh the N n my heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you\nDon't have those I don't know who's doing that and they do I really don't know who's your\nFans watch Fox you know 'cause it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watches Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but that's always been that way but I don't know I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does cause that's it's on watch\nAll the people who hate Trump right yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on it for the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I if I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do now synagogue thing is he's\nOh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely but he's like you know did he he didn't go there have you dealt with today is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I Lived in a country\nAs a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning sender in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\nWhat what what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter a outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't find them to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but it has nothing to do with this and all\nThese cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nThat really is really that's what they we never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever the guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trained to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the Republican paint on was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about\nIt because they they had a very balanced view of that one for a understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time was re understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them and and they always complain about discourse isn't that a great example is terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individual shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not use ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob Pat Pat in this morning is because uh you know he sees doing more on trivia and\nUh and for a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little wire like an hour a week as and just be maintained yeah interest me mean to\nNo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nAnd in fact repeat it ah it consistently gets repeated a it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nWell thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's Sunday you\nKnow we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I have a free tickets but seriously oh now all of a sudden you're in maybe it can change that I can you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ...\nThat would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what it is it's Sunday\nA Cleveland I think it Sunday yes it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYou were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nIs that it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the proceeds from\nThe I'm from the event and um we're giving them to I'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to\nOr to the uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give 'em to yet but we're we're uh we're\nWe're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um to a a local Jewish um center perhaps the\nThe synagogue and I'm not sure they're not stance from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember [laughter] and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example of supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros uh as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel award [laughter] that was I thought that's really national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people crying but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented\nBy the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it [laughter] it's all okay that's not a big one that out of bed quite a big one so\nIt's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and I ...\nThe people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal has progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him if I wanted him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world\nThat but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew the same way they don't\nLike been Shapiro because in front of a hero party the policies you know like I don't understand the racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx\nHe was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because he came up with the idea of communism I I'm not a fan no not a fan\nOf fat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized venture Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who was one of the biggest finance here's the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\n... it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas this legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... ... again this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say\nIt anyway because they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they think they claimed to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there too [noise]\nYeah I felt a battering I don't know what I have a good point and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nCheck out the lens blog five Ninety Days yes J. dot com and keyword

place\nAre we sincerely which are week we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell was paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America\nAnd not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution were fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on I I'm I we\nCannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line like climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value\nThat's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the\nIce age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... and in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nNow that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you\nKnow where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up that flew violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is ... this this collusion\nEnd that yours yours system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system\nAnd it doesn't work\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about your who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about litter\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only actions do don't tell me what you believe show me what you believe\nMad country or a good country that's that's the question we have that [noise] is the western\nWay of life we're saving is it good is it nothing about a bunch of ... gender males white males white Europeans that of oppressed people\nIs that is that all is that all it is\nCan I ask you do when you think World War two officially started when did it really start start so not our involvement of yeah not our involvement uh gosh I mean the date I'm not going to get ready or just give me an event [noise]\nTough one uh\nWould you say Germany invades Poland or you know breaks the it's rainy with you know I mean I'm sure you do to a judge Chamberlain or ... ... so you're talking events that lead to weather events I mean you could go on for a million different places and that\nAnd I'll give you I'll give you one how about when Japan invaded China happened in thirty seven if you live on that side of the earth yeah you'll think World War two started then Japan invaded China\nManchuria and they said the only problem was Manchuria is all the ... Mm that sounds familiar\nOr and so they invaded and they started a mass slaughter mass slaughter\nAll of the you know the bad bombings of civilians that happened ... years before we were doing it or the Germans were doing it and how it started in thirty seven in China with the Japanese where was the white man\nNo you know where the white man was you know how history reflects that's now America didn't say anything at the time America didn't step up to the plate and stop the slaughter in China\nSo wait a minute hold it just a second so are we supposed to get involved in everything or are we not supposed to be involved and everything when we get involved you blame us for getting involved in saying we're trying to jam our stuff down everybody's\nThroat when we don't show up you blame us for not showing up either way according to you we violated quilt our values\n\nWhat our values\nOur values used to be we our enemy of no one friend all now that gets a little dicey\nGets really dicey didn't get dicey apparently when the Japanese invaded China\nYeah that's because they only care about Europe no actually no we couldn't fight on all of the friends\nHad to choose we didn't even want to go save Europe America didn't even want to go into war well how could you\nOh my gosh how could you that Europe [noise] wait a minute\nWe're supposed to go to save the white patriarchy where ... wait a minute we are to blame for all of that because we didn't go in and save the white hierarchy I thought you just said that was bad should be destroyed um\nIs America bad or good let's have that
