{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "From Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts\nAnd it was all about do you think that maybe the president shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote horrible you think the president maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was skating facts that were given during Dr forts testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing the little shade and for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and are we going to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yet\nTo be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nWere coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number I Can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to\nGet away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught\nAnd heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nOr else will rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] um you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the one hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow the look on the phone up at it right by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get notarized after the day\nYou're listening to

C. S. J. lo and I urge radios\n... dot com and on your phone with our high orange radio after [noise] this is a\nFox News alert on Rogers stir and there are now nine justices on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in this evening after being burned by the Senate President Trump claiming victory tonight at a political rally in Topeka, Kansas he will\nThe charges are upsetting a and and uh they're obviously they triggered him entire a national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are printed in this country at the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence\nFor any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story that is the story and I for one\nI for one we'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn a a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm and we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nNeither listening to blend that probably am so [noise]\nIn my village addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of\nOf why we should really be talking about something entirely different why\nWe should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely\nNot true in the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving\nNobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking the question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both but is it\nOn the on the whole has it helped more people or hurt more people\nNot having that conversation we are having it now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the city\nThat'll area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we'd never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing months how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not to talk about\nWhat capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we're talking about today I was maybe the last segment of your great show\nAnd and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean it it's going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night there's going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take after prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I ... you know the big ideas are being trash the ideas of freedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah\nBut also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians it bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ...\nAnd I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believes\nAnd their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works while you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system it pulled people up to billions all around the world\nThese are big issues that we need to be talking about in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your\nDo I'll absolutely so some Nineteen Seventy\nUntil today you know when when you and I were really little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on there was really in the seventies that people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been eradicate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is it two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that\nDid that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me or through um that we are not using the first half of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter you know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as\nAdam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of all we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people so so competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas fact is that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a free and democratic nation is very very important anybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nTo compete means to do it better than the other guy fairly peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with the question I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism however\nThere is a throughout history some people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it it just seems to spiral out of control when you have\nYou know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating people through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you how do you make sure who's who can compete against Google\nHow are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point to that like to hear your answer on that when we come back [noise]\nClans\nWeekdays at five thirty Easter join us for a brand new program where were fired up about the time ever wonder why the stories that we use these days I Want to hear we\nWant to see how that important for why we discussed the things the mainstream media won't touch it was like it's your lucky day you're like me and the guy for our yourself then yes and why it matters\nYou wanted more so you've got the news and why it matters weekday five thirty only in the blaze TV [noise]\nThose news talk on line and five Ninety KCBS Jay ... I'm\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty percent and trading was about two thousand dollars are going to get to Laurie from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but it was right it hit\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you\nHow do you reconcile that because I don't want to take money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of built\nIn ... around the castle and that\nKept a bunch of wealth and the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through current capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a those basically ... system over wire deals you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever ... whatever isn't whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law and our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom non so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like stretching out potatoes\nSome ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country I wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university three four five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise that can't rise because we have a discriminatory system unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen on until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and personal initiative without going to college\nAmazing or that it's it's that early I think of apprenticeships and I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens times since we've seen it it's amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies\nBack with more Arthur Brooks and is America worth saving that Mm\nMan you check out the lens blog advice dining case yes J. dot com keyboard and back

two thousand and it was all but it's been nominees and so but it was common sense yeah yeah it's been a long time so I joined this is lots of fun joined us grab your tickets now Glenn\nBeck dot com slash to her okay back with a Arthur C Brooks\nHe's the president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human beings like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm yeah however ... we're not having\nAny one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry because we've ... you know unpaid from that capitalism\nIs is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nIt isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill arrives in the constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and true in good\nThe big problem as there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment and on college campuses on the right and the left or ... or ... dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other I mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically\nThat's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we love we just have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have\nTo hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talked about the things that really bring us together and then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time their way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive and to say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because he is your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective the moral objection to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy\nAnd free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history\nIt's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say and now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um sold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you described\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you

not willing to fight\nDonald Trump allowed this to happen and Kavanaugh would have been completely discredited I think under any other president he would have just gone away discredited because they would have said you know what it's not worth it we don't believe those charges and he would have had no platform to defend themselves mhm\nDonald Trump is there one thing to say about him he is a fighter he does not give up and uh you know sometimes that's good sometimes that's bad it was very good\nBecause I Can't think of any other president in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan that\nWould have stood for this and would have stood against it\nKnow I Know I the heat surprises me a on a pretty regular basis and I guess I should be used to it by now but uh\nUm you know that's why that's why people voted for him yeah for for this very reason he's willing to ... he's willing to stand and make this fight because he believes in it\nAnd it's ... it's just nothing I really didn't think he had it in it yeah you know we've talked about it before\nYou've got to admit when you're wrong and here's another case of me being wrong and I I Will tell you I think this guy is such a solid citizen at

Supreme Court followed by a swearing in Republicans and Democrats still reeling from the long process of fifty\nShe's teaching but what is she teaching with all the ranting she's doing what is she teaching hatred\n\nI feel bad for this woman I really do\n\nShe goes on these rats quite often by the way\n\nShe doesn't like Brett Kavanaugh she doesn't like President Trump the reason why I bring her up is well a Twitter you get a kick her off are you going to kick her off\nIf this isn't if this if this isn't the epitome of threats I don't know what is\n\nWhat she really typified the [noise] the insanity that has overtaken the left no I'm Out in evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind\nAnd you know what I I I really\nI can understand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there is nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it\nYou're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that you cannot know that I mean this is one of those\nCases where it is so crystal clear to me\nJudge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves but that requires evidence that requires\nSome sort of of case to be made not accusations\nBut a case to be made\nHere just drawing a person's life so you here's the problem with this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice\nShe's looking for wrongs to be a to B rice it somehow or another and it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was gone to be guilty was ... he guilty\nReally\n'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men or they had one was the alleged full land or\nThe other was a clear racist gundy I still think they were great men there were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors\nWhen you go down that road you always always\nUp killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying we should feed their genitals to the pigs tell me the difference\nBetween that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the universities\nIn\nBrooklyn that program\nIt's really hard really very very hard to [noise]\nTo remain [noise]\nReasonable [noise] when the world is unreasonable\nWe must because no one will listen to any message if we are just hurling insults\nIf we are fighting fire with fire it will change no one's mind if you don't believe me how many minds did we change\nDid we change the course of two thousand ten and I I Want you to know\nI don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence so I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed\nIt's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you\nBecause I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that you are you instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you were crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw sings a different way and as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nBut what\nAmazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it that's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish\nYou do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others\nAs flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller okay they just don't believe in and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose\nThe house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario if they don't get they don't get them through down because the Republicans ... and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless I mean and they don't come out with a huge play yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know that kind of where I don't think it'll work okay\nMother scenario he is confirmed the house impeached is Trump the house or impeach his Kavanaugh on perjury [laughter] think that is\nIf they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and\nThe Senate these\nThings are happening and they're well there's no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital\nAnd Trump OK mhm the only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote the only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote\nWhich could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it um however Donald Trump comes out and while he says yeah that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and\nYou get a guy that all conservatives are rabbit about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I was willing to die in a sword for memory might remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he asked them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you\nKnow that that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the\nPolls if if you\nPut a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nAnd that and burgers this way it was a terrible decision you then have\nRepublicans running to the polls and you'll also have Democrats but I think that's your best case scenario gets Laker Collins ...\nCome on\nGiving Web ... news talk on the go a diehard radio and five Ninety KCBS Jane dot com and\nHe\n... [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] Mm Mm Mm [noise] ...\nAt the Glenn ... All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin uh which ... I'm\nSo we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned Oh yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapists\nAh think you've you know it's up in the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the cabinet case in the house in case\nOf the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay\nAll right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory yeah she did a very spotty\nMemory and now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse or ... violin okay oh okay\nThat really got both of those little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does what did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course well yeah well in their words case\nThey both have a notes from there do they do around those cases out in the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now or never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction\nBetween those two things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll using\nMeeting me yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident numb and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way a key that was in a girlfriend has also\nA named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um\nPictures and those are things that she showed two co workers\nIn real time in\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that time but by the ... and I mean you\nI mean you don't have\nVideotape well it was you got the tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some uh uh one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't\nBe the thing that we have to take her work\nThat there is video with the\nWith ... with a friend and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more we have a

of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd the the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it he said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe ... he's a ... I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people or you know Google's monitor has always been there more than just a company to make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about paying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy is not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's continue tied this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how for instance you know there's there's\nUm a\nThere is this overwhelming uh\nUnderstanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen\nThat right yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results of the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing that\nIn favor of Donald Trump and ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and he ... you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming\nThe results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is Google is a verb but now I'm not a noun verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed\nRight that's like going to a dictionary that will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem no you're\nYou're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this so it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about as far as\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineer's saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing in Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way of fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and\nAnd and Hillary arm wrestling probably not going to convince you devote a different way that wasn't that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because the confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good and you know that it's not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peters whites are is with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role

blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith an acme incorporated dot com but\nHis acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert up sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nLike there's that this is just the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay this center is the main city of Beijing how many people it used to look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle\nThere is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "07"}
