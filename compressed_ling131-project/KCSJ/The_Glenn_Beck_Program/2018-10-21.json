J. lo\nAt ... dot com and on your phone with our high heart radio after [noise]\nRaking from another agreement I'm Joe cheer on Fox News President Trump says he will pull to us from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia because he says Moscow was not abiding to its term\nSure well we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite commentator they're still\nKind of you know it's the see the human hand you know and everyone knows humans are kind of already an adult when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine they turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust\nAnd it's subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed him in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it now we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about\nHow Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know\nThat when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this and the national a study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or in a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nYou know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen Ninety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism\nUh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven days there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift\nMillions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nAre that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen uh working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using\nThe Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system itself was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nOr you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them\nAnd uh I don't think we should be surprised\nThat we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually be able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world\nAnd will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but we will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glenn\nIn trouble [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm who started the race [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good the good and the good news I mean the the good news is\nThat um that Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use a ... is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now\nInteresting left in New York Times\nThe times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on may share all of their emails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing\nYou know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google and I wrote a piece about that was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago the good news is you don't do that\nYou're okay let's end it there for just like this has been asking that for a second\nIt will come back with the bad news plus the the I think he's in different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but these big tech companies and\nSome of the other things that uh he has found how they are monitoring our children and it is remarkable and we are running out of time before Google is the dominant than just can be stopped [noise]\n\nAshley suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill my one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have\nTime he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line\nIt's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com um\n... news talk on the go diehard radio and five Ninety Casey as Jane dot com\nClient that probably\nDr Robert ... he's a senior research psychologist American Institute for behavioral research and technology he is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about a guy saw again it is indeed very creepy it is\nUm it's it's is it too much to say it's\nWe're on the ... were apps mind control or the threshold of mind control\nDoctor [noise] [noise] ah well we've been here for a long time so there's a you know there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than\nTwo point five billion people soon to be over four billion a whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected are dramatically uh every single day\nBy a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that's that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the target insurance hurts the\nShura targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect is really scary ah this\nThis means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders uh mainly to supporters of Hillary Clinton or exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional four hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh\nI don't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not I'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was gonna win so\nI'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't what\nTargeted advertising is all about but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something less competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive ...\nI mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envisioned forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally yeah\nYeah yeah oh no you're you're absolutely right they have it literally unprecedented power or to ... ...\nIs shifts to people's yes shift to unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power\nUh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get cranked out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\n... news talk on line at\nFive Ninety KCBS Jay dot com um\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty\nPercent and trading was about two thousand dollars are going to get to worry from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but it was right it hit\nTwenty thousand dollars will now seek saying bitcoin could be up ten times or more by the end of this year that means it could hit forty thousand dollars by Christmas I Am a skeptic pot you need to understand\nWhat bitcoin is what crypto currency is and what are the triggers because this is game changing technology and life changed\nIn investment even if you put a hundred dollars in bitcoin but you have to educate yourself first do that by getting my exclusive Glenn Beck crypto course from Chico right now it's smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven ... back that's eight seven seven PTO back\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you should consider cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and it fits in your pocket you can take an EKG anytime anywhere to order basic cardio dot\nCom that pay A R D I ate dot com give you feel heart racing or other symptoms\nTaken EKG on your phone and it just thirty second you can have peace of mind to knowing your heart rate them as normal cardio is also prevented attacks atrium relation a comment heart condition and a leading cause of struggling to order cardio mobile today music cardiac dot com that the K.

for the U.S withdrawal from the Nineteen eighty seven intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey\nUh to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um reviews standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was really fun I live in LA fun right hum that he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight out of that um but yeah so we learned our lesson\nWe took the criticism that we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work\nPeople criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead\nCommitted to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people\nTo address it a secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure than um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and voted that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um\nUh early on in the process not just to keep us honest 'cause I think we would have kept our promise but early on in the process\nWe ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these field very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple of year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to the university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers banning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would've gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end or do we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter]\nSo er hey as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and credible where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nGland

non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the\nProgressive stack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey judge it says this is a start says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged few are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper I thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nOn but um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat what if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that\nMean to

that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYou know we were scare mongers and racist for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but if I\nWent to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\n... no that is a fundamental um a a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have it can't be that way\nSo we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you\nLock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected\nRight on my way up to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this was an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nThere is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities I mean that's you know it'd be which it wants that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... cities should run themselves in the cities can read whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want why do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb\nFarmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has\nTo do and how to live they don't understand taking any of my former friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's\nWhy the house and Senate both exist to give balance to that so that ... not not one side can\nHit it right you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further\nThen this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the\nUh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the ... the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York it says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was senator\nI shouldn't care about that because they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the opposite and is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed [noise]\nAre you arguing for king right with these the several stories in our own MIT give you the argument for king\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed\nOr no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but\nI I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... the Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ... can anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially if it was a union job really they wouldn't be you'll be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what what\nLaws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chase him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob and yes and I did use the word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just sucks they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no real way to win\nThe great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you
