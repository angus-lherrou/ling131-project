I'm Gordon Deal thanks for listening to this morning Americas first news\n[noise]\n\n\nCame up with one million ways to say thank you\nMuch and\nThis is general manager mark Merkel we're celebrating twenty seven years as cripple creek lucky 'cause he\n... October nicotine ... [noise] and going back program and\nWe need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now shall we need to make that a oatmeal do that she made in Palau town don't know whether we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing\nBecause this is this is just outrageous don't you think\nYeah she released this big ... basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was a she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes a which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won ... ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized hoops you do see we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't say what you do see in the corruption but they pay they should have a cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one\nUh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he kept the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of\nCherokee now this theoretically right could at least give her a technical\nDefense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and thing she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes and pow al ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nHow how how come out child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm going all ... I'm going all full I I've just I'm gonna I'm just\nBut let's all complain about the names of out ball teams but ... I don't want to hear how wild out already or from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to ... ... they\nJust didn't show any DNA from an actual Native American yeah what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA study so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against\nWe have to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want it migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood that it's not even what they tested\nA and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nRight like that's not the way this works they said oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does is it shows the lineage of game shows it it can be interesting in some way show migration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than a\nProminent friends disorder or it's true it probably would show that uh but so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think\nA several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white now the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing\nYeah I was like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right you and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with ... her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive we've\nLearned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white and now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she is not\nThat was what I was not allowed to\nApply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to accept that she is\nSo we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter\nI mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those you have to get them you know we've got to start making them or I Want one more than life itself okay so\nYou know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually took\nA horse or be a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet and he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else but and he took him and he\nPunched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or\nWas this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept a jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this\nAnd he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true\nI got to go in and say it's not my family you don't\nKnow [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this is what it was but it was the was it was not\nTrue how many advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls\nAnd I was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told Dexter you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've\nCares nobody cares if she is nobody cares if she isn't\nI mean what difference does it make and so ... by playing into it she's just\nMaking it about identity politics more and more and nobody cares no people are done with identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it\nAnd the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump said I don't care I don't care I don't care what you say about me I don't care what you accuse me of I don't care that's why he won\nBecause heat that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't walk this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else\nBut they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we're going to get rid of capitalism because it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers\nMan boy man or troubles especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really great I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India\nShut up\nCares with all of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is\nYou don't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activist who do believe all that craziness\nSo and they're they're so they're ... they're hardcore incentivize Riley when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh saying it's white ... on TV with you know with the crazy a crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate you're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate how do you go over\nTo the side of anti ... and say hey I don't think anybody thing is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nComeback close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean to shout the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean and cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nHere\nYou've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their

London\nThis is the kind of ... the kind of the same thing that you go job is said when he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately\nUh came in and he started taking over the media and and uh nationalizing everything is ... is there a ...\n... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is the military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect him most analysts are don't see any mediate\nA risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately\nHe will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change in constitution\nAnd it is not clear how he would do it he has suggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution for Brazil\nAnd that would be submitted to a vote or after eight so and in ... to to people to add actors in general so it\nHe had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office because the fact\nIs that he's not going to debate he uh is giving a\nJust a few interviews and usually he ... the process has been speaking mainly through social media\nSo he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time\nIncluding because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do\nSome of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWhat are those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nOr that ... son it ... and he posted on line a while back a photo of him I'm next to Dan in and said that Bannon as said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this\nAt this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but a ... a lot of himself a case of public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what do we know for a fact\nIs that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ... an expression of\nThis right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there is a picture of him close to the president's at presidential candidates an\nA and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\nAre Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth\nOr will have the final result it's very likely dead\nConsidering the current polls that bill so not a we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave also NATO fifty nine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and I'm both an idle AP Poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight there's our ferry sure of their votes so we we would have to have a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario but\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out uh some more we'll be following okay thank you so much ... appreciate okay thank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history a he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and ah he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in\nBrazil the other thing that is really should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobbled together this um populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames and uh what are they what ... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is\nThe Patriot act make it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm In the rest of the world\nThe the believe it or not softness and a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist\nAre sponsored this half hour is simply safe simply safe is the way to guard your home to watch over you and your family and it's the craftsmanship\nThe craftsmanship that actually helps um a simply safe beat out all of the other competitors and it makes it all worth it when you when you see simply safe\nAnd you see the price of it and then you see the quality of some simply safe and then you see the quality a and the lack of craftsmanship and more importantly how much you've been paying for the other system it'll blow you away\nAnd so right now you have people saying yeah ours is gone we're just we're not going to sell them the arms more got slapped sanctions on they admit this is horrible and it is it is and that's probably what America should do\nHowever let me play devil's advocate oil is already up at eighty\nSome some ah oil is headed up to a hundred dollars a barrel we've pretty much shut down the Texas oil reserves were I mean we're slowing them down because of the price of oil they couldn't make enough money so they kind of slow them down and we have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a spike as severe as spike a hundred twenty hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapsed us last time in two thousand eight was a spike to a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you also have turkey\nThis is coming from turkey and ... um turkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening\nEconomically the Saudi royal uh funds are\nBig in Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market is taking a hit at least in the tech sector\nBecause they think if this goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that that you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check\nOn um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options but would that amount of\nPower us and uh you know ... again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel doesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know is a is the big\nA sort of backstop right so what do we do they can stop the worst of the things that are as an ear presidents presidents do\nWhat do you do today I uh [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAh resigned [laughter] I Know ah I I think um you have to figure first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do [laughter] um so I think you're over\nThere with the king and the king says she's screw up total screw up this guy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control they started torturing him for answers he died\nAnd then they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe and these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter]\nOr whatever or you know but yes we did it\n... I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then\nI remember there was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem\nHere is that uh they believe that he was um you know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against to Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "16"}
