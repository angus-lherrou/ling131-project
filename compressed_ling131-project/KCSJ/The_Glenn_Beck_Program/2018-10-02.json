I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that they spent on fifth teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how they look it's it's certainly on its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court thanks for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWhat but what it does say when it does is it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his\nAnger when he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I Know what I'm saying even reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI would've thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without\nMe at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my levy to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWe're in

ground\nWith that being said and\nI don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIf those those charges turned out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in my ... she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out and this FBI that they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening what\nIs happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that's by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\n\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference\nThat you say you know he he\nYou know quit or vote went downhill went down in ... ran down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't\nNeed how long did they do take to do to the ... sessions of ah\nAh I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the ... went down so let it for weeks and three or four weeks three that we could have probably could have a fast rate other things going on\nCase so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks the one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nAlready been done he's the only under get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done\nAnd quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list ts so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select Tim let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't strange\nAccident but it could happen and it

I mean and I go to a yeah a\nDavid before we go into your book here to build and just get give me a minute on your take on Kavanaugh and what's going to happen\nI think he's going to get through and I think um I think this is one of the ugliest smears we've seen and at least in my life ... covering politics and thinking about politics and I think it's gonna backfire and that it's really brought together\nNever most of the never Trump ... and all this sort of disparate parts of the right and rightly so and um [noise] and if not I I was listening to before I think the Trump has to be ready for that and they have to push through someone else because the courts especially when you have a divided\nPolitical environmental as you do today the ... the Supreme Court's incredibly important and uh you know his ... there was a rifle seat there for the for for the conservative and the Trump should do it it has to do to get through\nWhat do you think about what do you think about Mike Lee as everyone knows him you don't need the FBI you could vote in a week\n[laughter] [laughter] I Love the idea I mean and you know he is not going to like wander off\nYou know hard core or so and then I have a okay so let's talk about let's talk about your book the thing I like about your book is that you do not a shy away from America's gun culture\n[noise] yeah I think we talk a lot about the politics of gun out of his guns and obviously it's important the ideology behind it but I think a lot of people miss the culture behind it the hundreds of years of of of imbedded culture not just not just in war but in in commerce\nAnnie and in just the individual lives of Americans and how important it was and how that is in our DNA and that's why we talk about guns the way we do so because I grew up in New York and [noise] country sort of alien to my\nYou know neighborhood and place I grew up in West criminals had them or I thought it was important to try to figure out what that was about and ah you know that's what the books about\nWow so so how did you I mean what did you find I I didn't know that you were you know ... is not part of the gun culture I grew up in the gun culture if you will my grandfather my uncles we you know they'd go\nHunting and fishing and we always had guns around a and it takes on a different meaning to me and to people who grew up around them what did you find\nRight I mean you know where I grew up every you know if you mentioned guns or someone had a gun that immediately think about it in a negative way not something that would be positive so [noise] uh you know just a personal story my my dad a little jewelry store in New York and it was a robbed and uh right after that my dad tried to get a gun and it was a ... ...\nYou know just painstaking process of trying to get went to protect your own property and your own work and your own family so that's I think when I started turning\nTowards you know they're having a curiosity about what it was about and then when I moved to Denver lived in Colorado and other places I saw what it was really about and um and how people treated it and how like an end are a member of the most responsible person on her\nYou know when it comes to gun so uh yeah and I don't know if that people\nKnow they don't have that they don't understand that at all hum it take me through some of the stories that you you talk about because I Would I like about this this is not a gun is not a book about um you know necessarily the laws and everything else this is a story\nAbout America and how we we do ... I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... one of the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where\nA person one from firing one you know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to

talk to you and maybe we'll do this or on Thursday um anybody who has read the book and wants to ah talk about it I Would love to talk to you about it\nAnd hear your thoughts where I might have missed it where what you may not understood um you know what what do you think is crazy or what is good\nIf you've read the book addicted outrage can we put this on for Thursday I'd like to hear from you Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... a ... just about the book\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it yeah which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after it came I did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week\nNow and if you've read it or let's talk about it on because there's a there's a ton a ton in there\nI I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with the ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're in you're just playing team a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this capital thing yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade there is a different part of it is it's about throwing the entire um the tire efforts of logic off base it's based in\nToast modernism huh it's explained in the book and in the times I look at it sound like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things that that didn't make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real the real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nThey're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy and to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blow their job why they did is they blew their marriage all those things why would elect act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted to outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading and try to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do um and ah and then joined us on a during his on Thursday\n[noise] okay [noise] um we've we've dealt with the
