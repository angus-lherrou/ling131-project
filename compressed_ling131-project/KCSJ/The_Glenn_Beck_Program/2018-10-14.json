explain this the first story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just do a stab Bush a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation we get from ball the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name swept Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well then use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not

with Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you said it\nUh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNone of what they want not when what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party of your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time their basic um\nIssue was a labor laws and um when\nYou have what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party\nAlways been a rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an anti

to one another but we\nWere not at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads that surge just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage kind of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime you know rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case talking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do in Iraq I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here to Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes we're the we're the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today\nBut but but again I I the Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious um but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry\nThey were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation of space there challenges but this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways\nA that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated a outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example a ... war at a people and\nReach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage well\nHere's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nAnd Christians in the age of outrageous is to is to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategic lean you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe
