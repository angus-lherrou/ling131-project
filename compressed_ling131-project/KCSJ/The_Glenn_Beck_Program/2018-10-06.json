{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "Here in the mountain Rocky Mountain time on your thoughts on that case yes J. and Sundays a tip so it's a just enjoy is if you happen to be out on Saturday Sunday Morning we'd love to have you uh\nMake an appointment with us and we're here every weekend one of the fact Montgomery in steward funeral directors for underwriting our show along with visiting angel we appreciate the great support to the community\nAnd the many years of a service of both companies so so thank you for that a special guest ... and really right up my alley lease Augustus and is a is as a coach and she helps you through a ... D printer source\nTo discover what it is that amber the burn\nFor something to do that's unique to what your gift to do that takes your experience\nThat takes ... you know the resource of time which is much more valuable to the resource of money but the resource of time and helps us to point towards accomplishing something that really resonates in our in our lives ... did I say that right Lisa\nAbsolutely it's about nurturing that that dream those possibilities options of being self sufficient of being financially independent nurturing that dream of being your own boss and doing their own thing\nThough we talked about being your own boss so let's let's go to ... so that we can broaden people's understanding of what's really out there I mean the guy is the limit\nIn in terms of franchising there are hundreds of them in many different sectors some of which you got to buy a big building for some of them you've got to serve food in but many of them you can do from your own home\nAbsolutely you know there's thirty eight different models as we discussed earlier right and only eight to nine percent of them are ... are fast food but we think of that 'cause when we're driving around that's the only see\nBut you know there's a lot of different models out there and I love what you talked about earlier when you when you think of what a franchise is a business model and that includes things like licenses and distributors ships um you know it's basically what I call a system\nAnd if you think of the acronym s y S T e M save yourself significant time energy and money and that's one of the reasons why\nI Love this business is because people who want to take control their destiny can ramp up fast\nThey can really go quicker because a business model has already been established ... audited over overtime tweaked in and brought up\nUm and there's just so many different things out there for people to look at and\nAs well said I mean it is a team sport and I've told so many people they said well I Want to do this business but I'm going to do it on my own yeah um and it takes sometimes three four times longer to do it yourself it it does to\nTo to get in capitalize it get a team working with you and take off fast and and that three or four years of time you used to grow something as you could do it in half the time you take a look at the resources that you pick up\nAnd the momentum that you've gained so ... is a great way to fix or to interrupt\nYou know absolutely and you know doing start up completely from the ground up there are people out there that can do it and they're very successful at\nIt this is just a different model for me it's about efficiency I have a I have a girlfriend that she can she can create a financial platform or marketing platform and operational platform you know an HR platform\nI mean she can do all that from the ground up and you know ... you know hats off to her um but for me I'm like I\nTalk to him about a financial system oh my goodness no way I mean so so for me having these platforms and having them tweaked in audited and already that's what really that's what really is good and you know basically when you look at franchises people think that they have to have the technical skills Dave\nBut you were and visiting angels where were you a gerontology\nAir force officer and I'd never even been to a hospital and they were you a pilot\nYeah well I did television shows for the year I'm going to fly but but you know what the system helps you to learn those skills\nAbsolutely and that's what people think they think that you have to have the technical skills but most of the time there's only two skills you really need\nTo have success in a business model and to run it well and that is managing operations and following a system and that's because you know you're not always in the business you can be working on the business\nBut you know the really neat thing about it is that the clients that we work with and you know this is the meat thing there is no cost to work for me or work with me no cost whatsoever there's no rest there's no obligation\nI get to work with people all the time he just want to go on a journey of discovery to look at business ownership and is it is that right for them is it the vehicle for them to get those possibilities options and dreams\nBut Ninety five percent of the clients we work with go on to in a business that they wouldn't have considered on their own war had looked at him prematurely dismissed\nAnd part of that is because they don't know everything out is out there and part of it is because we back into it we look at\nWhat are the things you want in income lifestyle wealth in equity we don't want you to buy a job yeah we want you to have the benefits that you want\nSo that's good I I think that you know this discovery process in everybody's life is the light bulb comes on and you're sitting here saying you're willing to do this for free\nAbsolutely and you know and it's a dream job gave I mean you love it to you always knew of always talk to me about the the CEO of your life go make things happen just print up sim cards and that's when I get to do all day I get to say hey let's get some clarity around it and you know what if you find out that this isn't the right vehicle for you\nThat's wonderful to because you've reached a point of clarity\nIs right and I've talked to the listeners right now because a lot of you are my age and many of you are older\nAnd you're thinking hey man I'd done it's all washed up a word for Social Security and the bottom line is you know we have on shippers out there that are ... that are running ... ... people that are just starting at my age of sixty one they're just starting ... nobody doing that for Twenty years as long as you're alive\nSo it really is never too late to discover ... where's your gifts are\nAbsolutely ... are expected life\nIs eighty five years old now I mean so what are you going to do with that time and think about things like leaving a legacy for your kids I mean what if you want it to you know and it was this was the big thing that I thought
