with the Castros in Cuba and manure oh in Venezuela they were ousted in a coup because they were destroying the country they were ousted\nJustice ... has done in Venezuela correct same thing\nSo they were ousted what happened they get pissed off\nThey start coordinating with the door Owen Castro and the ousted president they have been disrupting their own country now they want\nPublicity they want

Marxist point\nToo embarrassed their own country because they got rid of a Marxist\nDictator we're just going to we're fine with that we're just fine with these people coming in really what will they do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nAll the media doesn't care about any of that and you know the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they ... they just want them here as voters\nAlready they're setting out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats are in Texas set out but voter registration forms to illegals all over the state inviting them they've already filled out the the US citizenship box Bush yet they check the S.\nAnd sent this out to non residents all over the uh all over the state\nThere's we had like governor is to increase their power base we have the governor of the state coming on and just a minute we have Greg Abbott's coming out in about ten minutes or we're gonna talk a little bit about the uh the massive rally for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump uh yesterday in Houston it was\nUnbelievable and the massive turnout but this is in Harris County which is Houston Dallas County which is Dallas those are blue areas and it's a massive turnout massive turnout uh if the the red parts of the state don't actually turned out\nThis state could be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought or with the caravan of just learning from our friends to the south and what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here\nA candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kind of it's kind of walk on the side of the streets and just kind of having them\nAnd we would if is there was going to Canada and they were protesting\nCanada I think there'll be a lot of people have said just don't cause any trial just let them go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just right just what was not our problem they just want to go to America just not our problem well it is your problem and if\nMexico Canada would say to us you stop this or we're not going to trade with you we zero eight though like they give us any aid zero zero cheese whatever it is\nStephen

remember they were shooting the fact I have video of it today they're doing it again they're not shooting from behind so you don't see the crowd\nAnd Obama is out and he's in you know these these rooms that are like four hundred people maybe ... maybe tops two thousand\nAnd they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms 'cause he's crowds went away here we are at the midterms\nAnd Donald Trump still has these gigantic crowds and and listen\nTo what can we played Sarah the audio that was played on the loudspeakers outside of the rally last night and Houston listen to this\nCame by now [laughter]\nFamily finally porn I mean\nAll kind of\n\n[noise]\n\n\nI never had a cow town [noise]\nHere and then they\n[noise]\n[noise] I Can't believe we have to have those announcements\nAre but we we did um and the crowd was more than ... if I was a\nRobert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name or ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um [noise] I don't know calm about\nThis election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate or for any quarter and history thirty eight million dollars for Beto just for him that's not all that and\nThat's not including the ... money that is going into this date me outside a pack of money and tons of that um so uh we're going to talk to the uh Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to them a little bit about the caravan and also about what's happening\nUh here in our state he's also running for reelection but his he's so far ahead of any contender he is really the greatest\nGovernor I have ever\nI've ever lived under I mean I've never had a governor of a state that I've been more proud of\nA than a Greg Abbott um and\nObviously a lot of Texans feel the same way because it's a I mean it's a run away campaign for him\nBut the state of the state and the election when we come back then Governor Greg Abbott and arguing\nWeb ... news talk take us on the go way

far ... has been moving ... both north and south bumps on the twenty five court or you'll see some minor delays on fifty west headed out to ... city\nAh through Penn rose but for the most part everyone seems to be giving around town with ... major issues as of right now\nNinety KCBS Jay [noise]\nClaimed that come and we're thrilled to have a the a great governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with us now hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going\nGood it's always good to talk to you I'm a I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWhere this may be frustrating because the true answer is but it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a broad running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're sitting with regard to the turnout is a massive records are not just for mid term elections which is what this is a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nOr the amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is is is that is a massive number of people are turning out to vote with another with court but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure we're supposed to be critical\nSomething to stop it uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas if you care about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election we're because there are other people out there who are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nNeed to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said yeah that's the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I've always hated that phrase but in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say\nYou know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing I'm a election is it not\nWell he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent under do label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were a progressive\nAnd now they're openly or lifting themselves as socialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a isn't out and now he says he is a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the lab and the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies that is socialism a with a look at the uh wealth distribution policies that is socialism and these people don't realize and that is\nSocialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand is that as a George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars not directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that you as bonded these ground games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after that and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso\nAnd so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together the boats that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas that the passion of freedom that back to the liberty or in the past year the conservatism and so uh every vote counts and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were\nThey may have had their act their files access to Google says no evidence any data has been

person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every month up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man and editors but we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to hey let's why innocent until proven guilty is a thing\nA and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about some of these relationships break up and there's\nThings that and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed\nCabin or should be you know I don't know put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations ... it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time and he's she's credible\nShe's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports\nAt the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't have to win this crazy yeah it's\nAn amazing mind so that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nRight now a forty a four feet are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a seat it's forty six excuse me forty effect if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head they're a vibrant and then in Texas bill leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than he did a few or a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull\nOff six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past ah so you know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could lose it to that could easily diluted impossible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six this is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh still could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nThe election by numbers\nOn the ... over twenty third this is the Glenn Beck program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even\nConsidered it to really know well you know that which is er out but he ... saw Donald Trump\nYou know and which is er\nI I did not know that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and\nAnd Ted Cruz and others and what are they what are the ... one of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kinda brushed off myself I'm In I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women need to be aware of what's coming up and just saying\nYou happen to see [noise]\nStories [noise]\n\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the central bank gold buying in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has increased its gold reserves by one thousand percent in a due to increasing quote safety concerns\nIs the first time since Nineteen eighty six that\nHungary's central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons\nOf gold ah they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying are moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold in their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... who knows that\nAre hungry in Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans\nWere the first to do it uh they have been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years she's bought it from Goldman were that a lot easier right why us for back one of those early [noise]\nThe reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word and write this down on\nNo matter who do the very high path occasion thing again or you just saying they're ready to have\nWhen you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear\nPeople actually talking about well the problem is re high publication that's when you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss ... that's when you run for the hills okay\nRight now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold and who's gold really is it all\nAnd all of the central banks buying more gold\nShe ... what is it they know that perhaps you don't know may\nI suggest you ... and I'm not asking you buy an eagle I just want you to read just their report that is out now on what

political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them as they're marching towards our border they're not refugees\nThey chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt so what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the

okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing medical aid who's providing the water\n\nWho's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact there I don't know if we have this video\nBut if we could play this a video or if you have it the the video of a these migrants being loaded up in a giant semi trucks they're being trucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nYou pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk down right like that's not how that happened then now they're getting out there grouping up there for a couple of miles the cameras get them then they get back in trucks and ... and they ... they drive\nLook at the ... video enroll that video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into

do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation and then how does it play\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that sent who wins and and I don't think they're going to wind up in the country or reckon can I don't think that it has to happen that way but\nI'll tell you what if you have if you would have a must happen what do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around a process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in wars for America can\nYes ... year you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion turn way\nYou see there's an invading force these people they're not legally [noise]\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor\nPeople away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are

it's uh not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and then you end up going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor tech I I Know that so I Know I Know I'm a reason to believe it's possible but ...\nIf it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border this thing is going to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like

it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat ... so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media saying\nIt's always about local that as a as the Kavanaugh facing coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism is not going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think the Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bed\nI was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door of the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you know continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was then rod ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nThat I had to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away how\nDo how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up\nStop it I mean I think the\nPresident's made it clear where there are a country of laws or not and it it you know the the roost that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people did their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be

that are upset at the\nThe the the\nPoliticians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba they've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI think that I mean it's amazing to me that no one has said that that
