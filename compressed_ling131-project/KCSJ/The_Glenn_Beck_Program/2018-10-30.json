linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is and I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand\nPeople all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no but what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected and a regular tactics\nCall for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do\nNothing nothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching saying that\nComing to your house would you want\nThe police to do nothing what'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know what\nThey're not common for you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying

you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to

numbers hello sue\nTell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get to see what the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep I'm biggest holdings been close and now we start to\nTry to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss up still and we couldn't really moved them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points plays falling has a lot closer a really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tops of category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race 'cause you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we've moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat pulling their you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point uh and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for the Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points\nAnd Joe Manchin I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slightly nervous we're moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house church\nThat lecture and by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr want to tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great service really truly a great service\nI I'm going to be honest with you I have I've I'm\nI'm I'm fifty three fifty four year old ban love of beat\nI've never gone and bought a filter to change the filter no matter I've owned house after has never\nChanged it you've never changed it in your life never\nI just did adjusted first time because the filter by young soldier by is just a way to its way to like skip the responsibilities of being a man he had a veil just do they just send it to you so you don't have to remember ... and I know with you you just had your wife do it\nNo I actually went well well well I mean is there I was there\nOkay well I ... I took the filter I took it from the front porch and\nI said honey where the hell are the ... where do we change the filters\nAnd she said\nI think it's upstairs and so she went to one direction I went the other direction\nSome might say I knew it wasn't in that closet mhm um and ah interesting and so then she ... and so she found it and\nShe pulled the other one out and I'm like oh great well here's the new one and she put that ... you know ... does well so you were there I was there well it's interesting when Osama bin Laden was killed fellow al\nUh executive order to end birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good it may not be good we're going to see right now\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled with Kevin continue just\nHelp me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal you\nKnow what I mean ... and he reminds people in a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nThat makes sense ah yeah I think that's probably true because he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continue to dog pile\nAnd and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the presses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it they're out of control\nBut that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy\nThat makes me feel uncomfortable I think that we have to also back up and say that this is not just the just the Trump election right offices election for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate where you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it I think the issue or overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement or it's dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you hope to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the image like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run for\nTrump in Denver and Republicans remember they you know\nMonth before but I'm an eight or nine point they close that gap all the way almost with polls are so it was not a\nThe momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaving that would get out and vote do not sit this election out get out and vote ...\n... news talk on the go diehard radio and five Ninety Casey has changed dot com and um\n\nShakeout blends block

that you can listen to and download at your leisure ... welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship\n... problem well problem\nIt's an executive order I'd agree with them [laughter] so you're okay with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah that is a justification I think what would happen\nIs it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally okay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens\nOut what it's about no this was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a read a ration\nIs just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nPay that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and then I'll stop it yeah here the you literally Democrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here\nLudicrous that what that was ... and so it's an interpreter now all this time right but you can't you can't do it with an executive no but\nIf he's doing with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court I\nKind of okay with that yeah and that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just because I\nConstitutionally I think no the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be entirely there is yeah I think it would be interesting to see how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in\nNow rule on this than with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was going to be fascinating to get out and it does happen imagine\nChuck Schumer and uh and Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe really believe this\nThat guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh really I mean\nYou can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and we say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play can we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\n... um [noise]\nYou know in a week people\nGet to make a decision is is the America they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a porn behavior I get that guy really a guy who was sending a message\nBy time and time again tweeting about face forward talking about is bad hair day there that was done intentionally [laughter] send a message\nTo white nationalist\nSays about me that much\nBut I'm I'm going to watch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nI'm just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know it's a twisted they well and that's from a hard core conservative yeah she got her own nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not not at least not at\nAnd he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nHe was going to yeah right yeah not again it's just a matter of timing I'm All right so here's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this game changing stuff\nAnd between a bitch coin you know crypto currency and block Jane\nThat is the future and you need to understand it takes is Glenn Beck exclusive\nCourse right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or coal eight seven seven ... back eight seven seven ... smart crypto course dot com [noise]\nWhether those news talk on line meant five Ninety JAGS Jane Donnie ...

President Trump is threatening to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship\nTerm told accents on HBO he plans to end citizenship for babies born to moms who are us citizens including illegal immigrants\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order but\nMichael Wildes the immigration lawyer who helped Milan your trunk when citizenship test\nDoes not have the legal authority to do this it as well civil war ends of the fourteenth amendment\n... ending birthright citizenship would be unconstitutional\nFairly Catholic reporting from New York general services well began today for the first have eleven that Tim said the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting president trampled visit Pittsburgh today to honor the victims of Saturday's shooting massacre and gun\nAround with taking legal action against President Trump for using hit hit some happy at a political rally hours after the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh Pentagon\n\nAmerican I'm Damian than a Fox News that's what President Trump believes considering an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country illegally are not as a U.S citizen he tells actually goes on HBO\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do you think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in in the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know print brave in doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might've been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in a way that it was a given birth to\nA man I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened and egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red build America you can hear it on the uh I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ... Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the care of them [noise]\nYou know I think that it is something that for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on 'em in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nThat's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do\nAnd we follow a to construction workers that um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and\nI think that we're seeing this year I think that this caravan it is just not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent fuel out of that because a lot of these kinds of labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis and you in Los Angeles\nIs is that there is is the drug epidemic there are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that\nI'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare to fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers\nThen when they end up using men\nAre using the the health insurance or they end up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically a rehab tourism\nHere in the in the Southern California area that has been a that is it being attributed to the homeless surge of course last you know basically follows the the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to Obamacare as being part of the reason why uh their kids have gotten\nOut here in Los Angeles and then get end up getting stuck out here\n[noise] um you're covering also one other story I went to a cover with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for

together\nNow I I saw this did you see data for progress stew [laughter] yeah yeah for some good stuff on this actually yeah I think so too I'm Glad to hear you say that so let's let's talk about this

Seventy six percent of independent voters say yes\nFifteen Percent say no I I how would you answer that yes or no electric the most qualified\nPerson regardless of their genitals donors hair if I don't care or support assault weapons ban fifty eight percent say yes thirty nine percent say no\nI mean that's again the salt weapon's ban is a tough it's a tough a\nSummary of what it actually is because it was only the males matter and people don't know I think it's a scary guns but I mean that's not a typical that poll for an independent\nI think this one is really interesting 'cause there's two questions support the rights of kneeling NFL players fifty seven percent of independents say yes thirty nine percent saying no\nHowever there's also this question support the actions of kneeling NFL players thirty nine percent say yes and fifty five percent\nSay no so people support their right to do it but don't agree with what they're doing exactly right now that it's not the way the media is portraying dope 'em and I think it's the way most conservatives feel right like yeah I guess they can do it but it's not that I mean that's not the right way I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct\nOr support single payer healthcare fifty six percent say yes thirty seven percent say no\nAnd that if you're wondering why you're getting so many people jumping on that bandwagon at the polls like that that's why the Democrats are doing it\nDo you want Congress to check Trump fifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent say no\nAlso by the way the founders said yes to that one yeah and that has to any president\nRight that that should be part of the role that should be a hundred ... one hundred percent um do you support them lower investigation fifty two percent say yes forty two percent say no these are independent voters compare that with another poll yes he's\nOf a real crisis on our border\nPlus what's happening to the economy\nWe ...\nWe are we should all hold our breath and not do anything to add to the chaos\nBut the time is coming where we're gonna have to pay for the mistakes of the past and when it does I recommend that you think like all of the other central banks around the world\nAnd you have something that is real intangible now is the time to go to gold line and get their important to risk information and find out of gold or silver is right for you now you\nYou don't have to do that if you're not convinced by what I'm just saying they've put a special report together on what it means if the Democrats take one or both houses of Congress\nAnd it's pretty eye opening and what it means read this report it's free just go in coal gold line now an eight six six gold line one eight six six gold line ask them for the Freeh report they'll send it to you and I'm telling you it's bone chilling\nAnd it's real what happened\nThe ... that sort of metric toothbrush and makes brushing most simple affordable and

somebody was a socialist you're a racist\nHow 'bout that to see that the Tea Party was violent\nAnd that Occupy Wall street who were actually planting bombs in Cleveland to Berlin ... will blow up a bridge stopped by the FBI that they weren't\nThat you can't call a bunch of people clad in black masks throwing Molotov cocktails and breaking storefront windows you cannot call them a mob\nI I don't know\nPeople feel that they had been lied to and when they feel that they had been lied to and on top of being lied to they feel that they had been singled out as the\nProblem they don't take kindly to it\nNow right now the media is all about Donald Trump's rhetoric now I Want you to listen to this is Brian ... is stupid the newsletter thing that goes out every night and he is wherever he supposed to be the check on the press so that's\nThe key message in President Trump's mid term playbook hate the media fear the migrants caravan save me from a democratic oversight\nHe's trying to stay on message despite the Pittsburgh massacre and the fallout from the wave of mail bombs that means he's bashing\nThe fake news while newsrooms or on a heightened state of security alert\nIt didn't seem to care about that with me when they were attacking me and my family was under attack\nThat means he's talking about a migrant invasion at the southern border while authorities examined the Pittsburgh shooters hatred of invaders and Jews\nHe's scheduled to travel to Pittsburgh on Tuesday even though the mayor has urged him to postpone is visit it's likely to be a very big story on Tuesday there\nWas a White House scolding Sarah Sanders surprised the press corps by\nScheduling of rare White House briefing on Monday at the briefing Sanders claimed that CNN rushed to blame the president for the pipe bombs\nSee at our at CNN PR responded no press secretary CNN did not say the real Donald Trump was directly responsible for the bombs send to our office by his are again to embolden supporter\nWe did say that he and you should understand that your\nWords matter every single one of them but so far you don't seem to get that Bloomberg\nTrump is inciting people the president should be unifying and instead he's exciting people and inciting people said Michael Bloomberg to CNN and exclusive interview on Monday\nOn October twenty first the Pittsburgh suspect wrote on gab I have noticed a change in people saying illegals they're now saying invaders I like this\nIs social media footprint showed how hatred of Jews merged with the hatred of immigrant invaders who he may never know where he heard this hateful language bud right wing TV and radio has been saturated with invasion and invaders talk for the last two weeks\nWebsites and social media feeds had been spreading conspiracy theories about Jews helping the caravan\nSo I Do hope there's some soul searching even belatedly about this the humanizing content in coverage\nFirst key point Fox host Fox gas GOP leaders are all talking about an imminent invasion even though no such thing is happening\nOn Fox I counted more than sixty invaded in ... invasion references since October sixteenth invading was brought up more than a dozen times on Fox Business I counted more than Seventy five invasion references mostly on Lou Dobbs show by the way this data includes repeats\n\nBut now Trump is using this word\nThe president apparently is in second guessing himself on Monday he used the word invasion for the first time in a tweet\nBut many Americans perhaps most are looking at Trump's decision to send fifty two hundred troops to the border as a stunt or political theater\nOn MSNBC is all in Michelle Goldberg she said quote Trump is not only created this big lie about this caravan that has inspired mass murder\nBut he's now shifting the resources of government to substantiate his lie\nAt the same time on Fox Tucker Carlson review or wrists reassured his views are viewers that migrating caravan is a real thing but what do you do with the invaders\nAll of our Darcy emails I think the natural question to ask is what do you do with invaders this rhetoric from Fox is particularly charge because a flooded tells the Fox audience\nOne doesn't lead invaders into their home when faced with the invaders one generally uses everything at their disposal to confront them including force and that's the message that Fox is relaying ... millions of people and quote\nShip speaks the truth\nQuote there is no invasion no one is coming to get you ship Smith said on Monday there is nothing at all to worry about the caravan is only talk about the myth terms that is the fair and balanced\nThis holiday season impress everyone would brand new made to order custom blinds from blinds dot com check out there
