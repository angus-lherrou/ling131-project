{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "[noise]\nBecause you hearing you know last week actually following you are doing this I mean I I must have ten people have been yelled at until they had to leave for restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nAnd Mitch McConnell yes Mitch O'Connell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton tried and I walk up you know but I\nIt's not clear that there was Hillary she leans recently being unpleasant\nAnd something being okay I'll take your protesting something you're disagreeing about you know I I if I get paraded children from their parents and I went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... high endorsed third term\nSo there you have the big separation okay I especially in a day like today where we're going to be\nA lecture by the left about about stability all of a sudden even mind that that exchange that was on ... recalls and show not tonight but last night uh that\nExchange was between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Philippe Reines and of course Tucker who\nPeople will say looks like book so it's bucking took a or people say that I look like Tucker but they don't know if they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me uh but\nThey're having a search engine you notice that that he makes it clear rains makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know the harassment\nAnd stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like that is acceptable\nThey don't say oh sorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't indoors we're not associated with this isn't representative of us they actually try to justify this\nBehavior and I keep adding to point out to people that the the line between these are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever or we're going to the family members or friends\nAnd people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken\nOn either by me or buy them right I mean on one side of the other is that line is\nVery thin very small all it takes is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little ... of one person who just cross easily they're already screaming airspace they're already yelling at your restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you\nAnd trying to intimidate you\nYou really think that our for one of them to all of a sudden you know give a little shrug it a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that but what showing poured ears that the left or you know as shooters those idiots went after Nancy Pelosi I said in every other conservative but I Know and and respect came out and said those people are are more on\nWhat they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left the diplomacy wing of the Democratic party a big favor\nA boat oh by the way they talk specifically about that it rains 'cause they they have to pretend they're some consistency Rangel's say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it blows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until shall we ensure restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I'd never okay I think what happened that she thought she was fine\nThe other day she was kind of a fundraiser and a group she was with her to do any you don't see anybody up and said Nancy Pelosi I'm going to yell at you until you leave the palm because you have a ... year shorter policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think an old person let's say you got to go out and that's not what happened was I Lived in such a shortage don't do it because they're not ... in the last ...\nLook I think needs to be done and I appreciate the Tucker set it and the Oh thank God that people like Doug or have the kind of plot for may do or they can push back on this nonsense no conservative we had a political culture and in our political culture in this country is unacceptable to\nMe you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now they're saying they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think the behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heck oh people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think that it's\nYou know I don't I don't think it's necessarily dangerous to the people writing your Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that you know ... where does that stop\nWhat about waiting for somebody outside their home\nYou know I Wonder where Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment in in uh on Capitol Hill or in downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate\nAnd and they can they follow you can they follow every you go you know this whole notion of there in public so they can be a target of or did they now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear them a Democrat said things like\n... ... just you know enjoy their frog legs as I sit there at the table well people are losing their health care of and just as\nChildish talking points stupidity you\nKnow you're a lot of the older the ... the roast chicken while the poor people of America are suffering ...\nThey they try to create this whole narrative justify the whiny childish ... which is really a very\nCommon and very widespread characteristic of activists Democrats their whiny screaming children and they act out and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media does\nAn important political figures I mean as much as you think he's got sleep rains arrived represents names important\nSo this is this is the distinction they're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does they celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics and they really hope that the American people forget that\nBefore election day [noise] really

represents an old Democratic Party\nHillary Clinton's a rallying point for the right they use that messaging against Hillary Clinton to drive out their vote so I think he's that ended up seeing a huge

who are Democrats that's is that with a CNN panel interviewing Florida Democrats\nAnd and you know this is one of the the issue is one of the problems the Democratic party's gonna have to find a way to deal with and that is they have all of these\nEstablishment politicians who are really ... you know they they just they don't go away they owe cling to power forever and they have no sense of of

wants more and I told you why the the Democrats the ... the whole mentality is that they have\nNot really accepted where or what happened they they haven't really accepted the Trump one that's why there's such a fixation on your coming up with some explanation for how Trump cheated essentially that's why there's some version of\nThat stuff and twenty sixteen that wasn't really the American people speaking out that wasn't the American people choosing something different for their leadership it was that the Russian collusion whatever whatever ... something doesn't matter what it is at this point you know something\nBy the way I I I'm going to be talking to\nOn rising tomorrow George Papadopoulos\nAnd and I got just becomes a ... where we are going to be airing it tomorrow morning Papadopoulos was the guy that they have built this whole narrative around that oh because\nOf Papadopoulos a that's why they needed to set up this FBI investigation I spoke to this guy ... the FBI and the department of justice should be show embarrassed\nThat this is a person that they thought they should bring all these resources to bear against\nThat he said that he had ... western intelligence agents\nSet upon him and try to and drop him I mean that that's he makes it very clear you'll you'll see it in the interview and\nThis is why the guy the guy got fourteen days in jail for you missed remembering the date of a conversation with Joseph ... sued you know the reason I was fourteen days and not for you know and not for years because everybody knows that it was a row of it wasn't even material fact didn't matter\nIt's not like oh because he lied about the date it change the narrative of his guilt or something else no they\nThey just wanted a hammer him and this is what we we are dealing with a mass irrationality in this country about Trump's election in in many ways and I know today's a particularly\nA sensitive day to talk about that but it's very much there it it it's part of the America that we're we're living in right now so I I just I just worry about that please do check it out the interview you were opposed to tomorrow you'll see it but\nThe interview that I was ... and you know we'll see what I mean anyway ... thanks is running again flows he thinks he's going to be next week or the house some Democrats are fed up with it but I don't think they're really

uh but what I Will tell you many others won't is that they're they are abusing the process\nRight now by their not technically illegal and I we all need to understand this if they show up at a port of entry and they're from Honduras and they ...\nThat they are incredible fear of their lives\nOr or the you know whatever the specific verbiage is that they're all using because they've been told this is what they should say they're not technically at that point illegals they will become illegals when they were led into the interior of the United states and they do not show up for their hearings or or if they're at their hearings they are\nTold that they must leave the country and they don't\nBut it's important we get all this right and they're not technically illegals\nIf they show up at a port of entry or even if they claim defensive asylum asylum laws are very the I shouldn't say laws asylum process is very favorable to anyone who shows up in the United states and and claims that they have

Americans even if they disagreed with ... with the government\nOr a form of government or something going on a government disagree they bring their differences to light they vote they use constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries\nBut\nMore than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries little over\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something to this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and uh\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nIn Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\n\nWe distrust of the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system is run we have a ... we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out\nThere were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a you know border\nDivisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIncreasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\n\nBut I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulp and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut the establishment a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposed by none other than John McCain\n\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day where martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards of Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned\nAnd and and actually executed by a those in the deep state against President Kennedy\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be in France in national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution number two there would be increasingly\nDivisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\n\nThree there will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate edition of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes now I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out\nAnd of course we have been analyzing and speculating about the state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is the invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always been\nThe dark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nThey while we're looking under rocks for false flag proof all we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where

season hope you can join us this weekend is we take your calls about your home\nBut I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom and if I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from\nOur authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked but\nWe have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica as best we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully that's a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but\nNot an enemy we're all on the same team and the media not not\nCoast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's in turn them into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keeps keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nIn our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community the entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again\nWill say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up way let the intelligence officials\nDo their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on\nJust the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but you have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it\nThey flew it most six more successfully and they protected\nFarmers than anybody in front of they sure did in ... and ... and when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America\nWe're on a good path right now let this pass continue and let's stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ...\nOr we will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown
