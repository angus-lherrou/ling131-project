Fox News President Trump standing by Supreme Court paid Brent Kavanaugh eyes the FBI investigate allegations of sexual assault against him Democrats\nIs it was just a far more work to show you had all of that fund and excitement\nMaybe that was the right word on ... at heart of the background in making nests and it it's pretty scary but um I've never seen yeah I Love the cat I've never seen any of that\nBut I was a few weeks old when that came out and my mother went and shot in the air that living hell out of her\nA night of the living dead you mean or the jokes have taught ... or the uh what was the movie you're talking about a shadow of a doubt\nShadow of the doubt that Nineteen thirty nine it's black and white ... I I highly recommend it\nWell thirty nine was gone with the wind right and the wizard of Oz\nSo you had some really big movies it's easy for a movie they get lost so now I have to look this up shot over doubt I Will check this out Jody I Will absolutely\nTake a look at that and a night of the living dead is the one you want to see if you want to be scared dawn of the dead was the sequel and I think it was a lot cheesier it's still is wonderful in terms of horror film classics\nBut to me there's nothing nothing scarier than nine to the living dead in a close second is Texas Chainsaw massacre too because I I knew the young lady who played the lead in that\nAnd that movie would just terrifying so I'm so glad you're still out there Jody so glad you're still loyal to buck and uh all of all of his exploits and appreciate you being there every time I'm here filling in for thank you very much my friend\nOr a ... a lot going on I Want to bring something up I was talking about\nAh just before the break I was talking about one of the sponsors of this program ...\nAnd it's a company that has a new social media platform and I think it's really important especially when we see what's going on on social media it's been weeks now that one of the brighter people on social media who happens to be a conservative has been silent some talking about James Woods\nJames Woods has over a million followers and Twitter has told him he cannot come back on line unless he removes something he posted he posted a comedic meet him\nAnd he even said this basically is a joke but they told him unless he deletes it he's not allowed back on the format and I thought wow this is a publicly traded company and and then I thought well maybe just maybe they're out there making sure that\nThey apply the same kinds of standards of principles to everybody who's on Twitter and I looked at and I saw\nThe horrific thing the Rosie o'donald posted\nAfter Lindsey Graham went after the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and called them out for what they were doing how they were destroying judge Kavanaugh and how they were actually make it impossible for anyone to want to be\nWell a Supreme Court justice God Knows what else will be affected by this attack on a good man but Rosie o'donald tweeted out\nAnd I have to um have to delete\nOf the things she said 'cause they can't say I'm On the radio she said F. you you closeted idiot this is the patriarchy exposed this is reality deal with it no Kavanaugh's confirmation not my president well Rosie O'Donnell\nPut that out there and went after Lindsey Graham and she's basically here's a gay woman who's making an allegation that Lindsey Graham is a closeted homosexual\nHow is that allowed how is that not considered hate speech how does that not considered to be over the line by the gods of Twitter\nHow Twitter how explain I guess if you're a liberal you can say just about anything\nI guess if you're a person on the other side of the aisle it's okay to smear somebody for example a Bill Maher did the same thing Bill Maher on his show this past weekend after Lindsey Graham gave his fiery speech supporting judge Kavanaugh\nThis was on television this weekend and appeared all over Twitter\nYou know which is bad is this truck before I\nThat Trump can either find people like him or make ... strain was stabilizing influence your boyfriend because he is [noise]\nChanel bill Marr has smeared Lindsey Graham and he is also smeared John McCain all in in Seventeen Seconds on his show\nHow is this a loud and don't even get me started on what senator now why did attacking Kavanaugh\nSaturday Night live attacking Kavanaugh and Graham and the entire process is all about any means necessary to tear down this nominee\nBut I don't understand how one social media platform is allowed to\nSingle handedly silence conservative it's I've been shadow band if I put a post on my Twitter account at stumped for and if you will and I include a reference to a gun or a firearm\nIs uniformly relegated to the ash sheet of Twitter shadow banning I'm shoved off into the abyss and not given the opportunity to let my audience read it\nBut if I take out the word gun or a firearm\nAnd put in something like banana\nInstantly it's available to everybody\nI Know it sounds paranoid but it it's true so how's this allowed how's this even allowed to happen\nWell I think we've lost their minds\nWe have given every opportunity to be offensive to the left and zero to be offensive from the right and maybe it's time we all stood up and looked at some of our folks and there are alternatives to these other social media platforms I'm just saying oh I don't\nGet me started on Cathy Griffin Kathy Griffin also went after Lindsey Graham and called Lindsey Graham ms Lindsey Graham\nAnd John Lennon overt CNN additionally said that Lindsey Graham had the vapors something usually attributed to a woman in the south\nSo Don Lemon Kathy Griffin Rosie O'Donnell and Bill Maher you can all make jokes that impugn a man's heterosexuality or mark a man\nAnd yet you are the people living in the universe\nIt seems like the people in the universe might get a little upset too but I guess not I guess this is about any means necessary and I just don't understand\nIt I maybe I'll get a quick uh movie here a time in New Haven Connecticut Welcome to the buck sex than show yet a scary movie for me\nYes I did a a Halloween you know as much in the lame\nYou know that's a really good point to the babies too obvious that they were talking about October and the fact that so many scary movies come out but Halloween now which one I thought like forty million of them\nCome along that God are you know I'm just going to say just like the gentleman on the part wanting park to hand down and no one mentioned friday the thirteenth\n... you know you're right on Robert England would be mad about that if we didn't [laughter]\nNo no no no that that's a nightmare on elm street that was my choice but Halloween\nSorry I'm Sorry I got people yelling in my you know no no that's not married out straight yeah\nI don't and you know what I recognize the shining and uh the empty all horror absolutely The Exorcist hands down five stars five stars but\nAll I was born in Seventy one so I don't really recall too many of them about the nightmare on elm should try not to allow a wage yeah it's way too many Halloween but we try to search age but those definitely\nWell as some of them work she got to keep doing it that's that's the way we are Tom I appreciate you for joining the conversation real quickly Dave in Albany New York you got a scary movie for me Dave\n[noise] ah the shining\nYeah it looks like the shining is running away with it tonight I thought it was going to be able to convince people that neither living dead is the one that deserves it but ah the ... Senate votes\nRight now leaning towards the shining\nOr false are classics and therefore I think for me there\nWell there's a lot of good ones out there I I've been in my\nMind has been open up to a lot and there's a lot that don't have monsters they just have terrifying story line it's it's crazy but thank you for calling and Dave I appreciate you that's a good suggestion again the shining\nThe incident happened in Connecticut well Kevin I was attending Yale he was accused of throwing ice on a man while one of Kavanaugh's friends supposedly through a glass at the guy no arrests were made President Trump says Democrats are the party of crime\nThere really are you look at what they're doing even look at what they're doing in Congress even look at what they're doing with our laws the way they treat our laws the way they speak our our country\nAt a rally in Tennessee tonight the president pointed to democratic policies on immigration saying they favor open borders the Justice Department is working to ban bump stocks which are rifled accessories that make guns function as if they're automatic\nOn the one year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in us history the D.

data data by a way of life data or the quality of life data okay so we're gonna sign these smart seems to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to and it's going
