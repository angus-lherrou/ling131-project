will us for a million dollars from the president to not want it to the no enemy but [laughter] come back in a couple of weeks of ... really are a problem Iranian they locked down [laughter] great people just bad leadership bad later\nSo I I like everything when Lindsey Graham or say they're still the very end I don't uh I like he he was he didn't read it the way that it's out it I could say that I I he just misspoke a you know he didn't mean that you\nJust met or Iran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact the Iranians up and many Iranian friends throughout my life and\nAh it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms of the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've got a whole ... running chair anyway\nI Love the other stuff you were saying about I was going to take a DNA test every Lindsey\nGraham is ... he's very much a very much a man struck by a kind of knew swagger that I think that he really understands uh he he really understands that\nYou got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to the mad I mean Lindsey and this and it's kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said\nLast few months you know what as much as as much as I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left to listen to the show I Want you know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they're willing to\nUh in terms of the of the ideas we can't just oppose them we got to crush the ideas\nI don't crush people but I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as a kid say we might have to own the lips a little bit\nUh so windy grandma I liked that he's been oh is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also\nThink that you know on on immigration he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him I got to get them a little more hard line on this stuff ... here's what he said liquidate their eleven maintenance illegal immigrants\nHere that came from burning the poor countries\nWhat do we do with them I Want to merit based immigration system\nYou got to get Democrats and Republicans working together ... control who gets the job more legal immigration moved a merit based immigration you can't ignore the eleven may and they'll never be a deal right where the Democratic party that does make a\nDeal with the eleven may in her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think he gets it on this one yet folks I think that Lindsey\nHe's a little a little too squishy on the issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University ... nerds for back me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI I don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is nine eleven it is twenty million at a minimum\nIs a vast number of people from a a generally speaking from one country\nFrom Mexico I mean the vast majority of them are from Mexico\nWhich also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically within ... with an enormous border\nAnd you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country really does I Know people are not allowed to national security analyst will tell you that when you have a population that has\nA that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that border we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over that border\nAnd then you have a population that maintains a tremendous and kitchen and tremendously powerful and continuing tied to the the what's considered do the homeland of the mother country a ... you ever\nA recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically gotta minimum destabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is a you know meet needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is look I\nGive him a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as I'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're gonna get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security well see what happens with this request for a wall\nAnd that's not good enough that's not acceptable\nTo eat and Lindsey talked a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half for the wall I mean excuse me five being in the Senate has been a half\nWill close the gap a duck I remember that ... Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go Trump's going to win in court he can repeal dock of the day he wins in court what do we do with these young people so I'd like to do a deal for wall funding for dock\nFull funding for DACA that ... that are I think I think\nYou could sell that to the Republican ... if it was ... you get that five billion\nAnd it's just deferred action still or that's not a\nA but it you know it can't be it can be citizenship and it can't be permanent it's just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the nine eleven but twenty million illegals in this country and Jill you have\nA reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years\nAnd if you by the way I understand that the political sway\nThat the Latino Democrat community in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration particularly from your from South of the border uh that will\nDo the entire debate and discussion going forward and all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses of new voters\nWho will essentially make the Republican Party a you know a an afterthought I mean they will they will be able to turn America into a one party state\nThat's the game the Democrats are flying the Republicans keep thinking about this like well you know maybe we can deal with them the Democrats are looking at the immigration issue is how do we make the Republican Party extinct [noise]\nRepublicans roles you know maybe there was a new\nNo no that I Do very bad idea [noise]\nIs that much more coming up teams uh stay right there they wouldn't [noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making online purchase or simply access your email could ... your private information at risk\nYou're being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider not only can they record you're browsing history but they often sell it to other corporations who wants to profit from your information\nThat's why I decided to take my privacy backed by using express VPN expressed VPN has easy to use after one seems to be in the background of my computer phones and tablets turning on his rest BBN takes only one clip and costs less than seven dollars a month\nIs the number one VPN service by tech radar comes with a thirty day money back guarantee protect your online activity today and found out find out how you can get three months free\nAt express VPN dot com slash book that express VPN dot com bust book for three months free with a one year package expressed VPN dot com slash bar\nOr in college ...

earlier sponsored by the Colorado army now and I have no right or banning of the\nLaughable argument I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native American\nIs is ... laughable to any serious human bit laughable I mean you should laugh about it at the wall Street Journal said if she is a person of color than words have no meaning she is as far from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kinda ... she used to she still clings to it but then there was just wondering well did she receive any benefit my friends there is\nSo much circumstantial evidence that she received benefit that it is also laughable to suggest that that she did not\nUm that she did not have the ... and I'm not somebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for law school do then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard\nConsidered to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens in last the hiring\nCommittees thinks that they can while they can but it's very important them when they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty that's a big big deal for them they have their\nPick they can have anyone they want and that's why I also why would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nIt must have gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to game the system so it just defies belief it's completely ridiculous I can\nTell you that I spoke to 'cause I have access to a lot of Democrats up the hill\nOr and I spoke to Democrats today who our colleagues and I got to say there were all there were all say it\nTo this is just there's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it that she thought that this proved your case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe had one more trade on this he rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total from [laughter] sometimes referred to as Pocahontas\nHe has defeated really the progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great unforeseen political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nBut then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president\nOn policy amok fighting back absolutely but what is this thing about\nWhat is this thing about a ... horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total calm\nYou know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is a lie start to finish and I have thought\nThat ah that that there is no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and wanted nothing because there's nothing criminal about anything that even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels ah or I should say about his contact with her and people are saying was all the campaign finance that's pathetic that no no shot no chance um\nBut I got to say now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jumped to the conclusion that Trump actually has had this affair with her\nUm what what I said I shouldn't say jumping conclusion I think that's obvious but why are we so sure\nA lot of people in those seem very brochure about it I I'm I'm just I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty\nToward toward the president so I'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I have thought that maybe he and you know had strayed from his marital out here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad\nEspecially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrat but there's also part of me the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the president referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week in this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say buttons that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's a part of it too and maybe he's human which we all know who he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nAre among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still we want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's yeah that's a little\nThat's a little bit beneath where where presidents or B that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect it's pretty darn good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know is not perfect me pretty darn good\nIt really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things start to come around to this notion of why do we have to why don't we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nWhy do we have to pretend like anyone is is beyond or not just pretend but hold them up to this standard of of moral pro bitty that isn't there for anybody else really in public life\nLook Trump is made more mistakes than a lot of other folks in that area but he's also clearly got a gift for politics for entertainment and he is he is the man for this era\nOr Elizabeth Warren let ... let me tell you why I said let me tell you why I say that instead of just staying in our ... let me break that down a little bit wider here's a perfect example of why I give Trump a lot of leeway why I cut this president a lot of slack\nOn some of the tweets are some of the stuff he says about you know people here or there that I feel like maybe ... is going a little far here's why\nIf it weren't for someone like Donald Trump if we had a Mitt Romney instead of Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren was going to be twenty twenty candidate it would just be him getting attacked all the time our guy getting attacked not fighting back and Elizabeth Warren getting away with being a huge fraud\nWho advocates for all kinds of class warfare while she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a she was at a tenured professor at Harvard law school I think a quarter of a million dollars a year he's making plenty of money she's got plenty of money\nUm and and all of that false miss all that fall so that she's out they're peddling to people would really go unchallenged than a meaningful way and the worst of all if she were to win the presidency against a Romney like figure\nYou and I would have a harder time\nPutting food on the table paying our mortgages or in my case rent you know paying bills taking care of family taking care of medical bills would all be harder because of Elizabeth Warren because she has wrong ideas because she's self involves because she doesn't\nUnderstand the way the world really works and because she's benefited from this system\nThe system in place that the left holds up at all costs of some people you know get a get special privileges some people will get pushed through now and and others are told well you have some form of privilege so you have to just suffer in silence I'm Sorry\nAt Trump has saved us from yet another progressive\nDestruction machine this case would've been Elizabeth Warren's while I'm laughing about the whole thing he's also don't the nation a great service by making sure that Elizabeth Warren focus hunters does not become president on the radio on\nIf I died yesterday dot [noise]\n\nThis wave of a just a a restoration of concern or the restoration of concern for our financial future for just so many um so many things that all of a sudden we're at the top of the list right\nAnd and also restoration of the American founding as as a topic of conversation\nI I'm just saying we're we're not we have not done anything about this yet and we've had a Republican House Republican Congress I'm Sorry what was the Senate and White House now for almost two years\nAnd we haven't taken action and I worry that we're not going to take action I worry that this is June going to become\nOne of these issues where are we all talk of big game we all talked talked tough on this\nBut at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that we got to spend less Republicans will talk about okay we can't tax more fine but the truth is we've got to spend less and that means we're going to spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time with that they feel like they paid in and so it's not\nAn entitlement at the government you know making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security is pretty much true we just need to change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age they're the ones and your great grandkids\nAre going to be paying the financial price for the care that people take it out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational theft and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nMeanwhile the feds collected record income taxes in twenty Eighteen so you know we're always told oh there's not enough there was not enough or you know revenue there's not revenue which there's too much more than a revenue there's too much spending\nGovernment has got to rein it in and in less were you know we're\nEither going to have a serious national conversation about this and take action we're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth\nI I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this issue because it matters but I I won't hormone or too much fucking Ron Paul did it for a little bit that was interesting he served as a big lead ...

year old boy twelve year old anybody um that's not cool it's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old\nAs somebody with strong opinions and who goes

seems to think that it is not just normal but expected for a twelve year old to be quote an act of asked\nKids should be allowed to be kids and the only way that a a normal child would feel the need to come home and cry\nBecause that young girl met another girl who did not show described as a feminist\nIs because the parents are engaging in a really relentless propaganda campaign toward their own children now parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that\nI think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice to a very young person by ... really instilling in um a radical leftist belief\nAnd not letting them keep an open minded and develop their their own beliefs but I also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America who our lives who are liberals have absolutely no perspective on these issues they they have no ability\nTo stand back and try to be a little objective their purpose other kids and you know letting their kids\nCome to their own beliefs and not feel familial pressure to take certain positions because even as an adult you should always be testing and retesting your

be surprising I think to anyone to find out that she is in fact less Native American than President Trump and that would be amusing but I think she's been thoroughly\nAs the kids say on this subject I

he urged them to Lone Star is transparency in time the investigation that provides on says\nI blamed the pilgrims really\nSerious and traditions are puritan history start puritan ancestry\n[noise] see I I I blame will William Randolph Hearst\nYeah okay I can see why you would do that how about this guy harming asks when you're you know you know tell me about a ...\nYear with a with the first drug czar in column and drug czar but he went on his ... marijuana we stay\nBack in the Nineteen thirties and Nike or any member of the movie reefer madness yeah I remember ... and this was a\nMexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to take the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually trying to twenty century Spanish civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War of the way up there um\nAnd I started to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana wall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up they created in the campaign around\nReefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called me from Madison talks about all the stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nTax act or ... you put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana and they put a tax on marijuana and they said didn't declare that you had marijuana in taxes on it you go to jail\nAnd then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana is legal and it's been illegal ever set but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are still with people who are\nThere simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least there's a police state\nAround the around people are just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana or psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol what we know that marijuana clause I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it said to be apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with a lot it every day the the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something and I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to\nAnd he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given into and brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a museum kind of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time and and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better\nOr a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... there were needed medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or\nUh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained is going to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because\nThe problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning that it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain\nBut it's felt physically but it's pain that is felt on a on a I guess you could call it on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain are wracked with pain\nExplain I don't have those work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people who say that they like\nThings like tram at all and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over it or or biking than or\nPercocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as the roast that most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be ally basically ... you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital\nAnd all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're going to this is my got here it's been caught you know you can't move because you know your your core has been cut and you can't move\nAnd it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced\nAnd that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you\nAnd the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill that's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe have an addiction to the smoke\nIs your body down regulating some natural production\nSo all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out a ballot what's really interesting to me why and how much of this stuff to talk about an exit central pain for example could be related to things like in information inside the body\nFrom too much sugar Yeah Yup or outwardly sufficiency maybe we're not getting enough I think we know you take zinc out of the diet\nCompletely one of the things that happened to get anxious to get to ...\nSo maybe there's people are suffering from from this condition supposedly never teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your diet\nSide of the information is going to go away just like that you were to lose weight you're going to feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nBut we live in an empire quiet where the empire depends on us eating sugar and eating grains and eating fast food and eating and eating and eating so they\nWell can be created yeah we again it comes right back down to understanding our bodies understand our body chemistry and this is what I dedicated my life to helping people understand how their bodies work at a biochemical weapons or biochemical level at all [noise] and that's what we need to be educating our ...\nAnd easy an ad that die you're gonna have blood sugar from\nThe regular party a vascular ... that's the thing is that you know if he were to tell us more about what needs to be put in the body ... instead of having his gas I think a lot more people would be healthier we wouldn't have to worry
