think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of Cristo even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was quite an exchange\nThere and um we'll see tomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show what the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a a shall we say

funding to say the men that guys\nThat guy's been treated turban and certain says well we don't we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos weird this one today and here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nGeorge what is what are your feelings now that it it has come out it's been a reporter here at the hill that there was an exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant that you weren't trying to do anything wrong that you oppose any trees in our collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that\nOf course has for me it's a it's a very sad that it was I was impressed when John ... reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that uh that was not presented to the court\nAnd that in my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative that I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian contacts whatsoever\nI've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy\nAs somebody who actually has no rush of contacts something just to not smell right at all to me\nGeorge Papadopoulos who remember when\nWhen it looked shaky on Carter Page you also had nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff\nWith a look shaky them as the auto Papadopoulos that's how the FBI justify this investigation that that it was mostly Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos was part of some of some crumbling back conspiracy will believe\nAnything don't believe anything this is\nNo normal rational person could sit down and look at the facts talked to this guy and come away with thinking yeah that's right he was trying to throw a presidential election that\nEase utterly insane orderly insane there's just no\nRationale to write all other than it it it explains for some people or gives them an outlet for their anti Trump rage and anything that gives them an outlet for anti Trump raged they are in favor of\nSo if someone will tell them that there was a massive conspiracy to undermine the election everything and they have to believe that this total Patsy

leave the country probably they usually have a travel restrictions he's got and and also I I don't like that when he talks to me about this there even restrictions as part of his plea agreement about what he can say publicly\nI don't I don't like that you should be able to discuss any aspect of your case once you're once you're through the system there shouldn't be a gag order on you know once your your\nCase has you know once you've served your punishment your case is done but there was one on him so it's that whole thing was just nuts and he was testifying today on Capitol Hill which is why we were\nTalking about 'em there but it's the whole thing is just totally an orderly bonkers bill um and I don't know how anybody can think were they were a year ago and this would just do quarter

[noise] excuse me in mockery\nAh that that would be offensive to some people I I get that and I'm I'm not\nBut I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black face under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC\nJust I mean they had different anchors coming after NBC just fed her to the wolves on this one\nAnd then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology\nI'm here is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] when they heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness at Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a percentage of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume it's pulled okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of an old costume Halloween or otherwise\n\nI could have told her making a call me up and I have a little bit of a soft spot for her because she used to be nice you know started my career and having on her show and used to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future and that I was amazing when I filled in for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and and you know\nSo I have a secret soft spot maybe not so secret anymore for making Kelly I'm going to be honest about that okay I Do even though I think that she turned on her people and made a horrible decision by going to NBC and was on grateful for the position jihad at Fox and all that okay fine\nI Would have advised her because I understand how this game is played now because I have to deal with it from both sides and no one's paying me tens of millions of dollars\nNot even anything in the

or Chelsea and just know that not every person\nNot every person should be thinking about running for office at all okay there's there's a really very limited number of people that have to kind of a thick skin temperament\nSelf aggrandizing attitude and yes that feel called to serve but increasingly I think politicians are mostly megalomaniac um there there is an increasingly small number of people I think that really should do this and\nThink that everybody should I like this is where I Want to talk about term limits I mean this is just this notion that we have the political class that we do and they just stay in power forever is because the system is set up to the people that determine what the system is stay in power but maybe the\nConversation about terminals will have to wait for another time I just think that the Chelsea Clinton the notion that somebody would want to vote for this person who's never had a real job\nA and who was sort of let's not forget according to even some leaked emails was thought a very poorly at the uh you know the foundation the bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation where she was supposed to be a a boss and a figurehead at the same time uh she was not well ...\nTo our border is pre position all the materials necessary to build a tent city I mean living quarters shower facilities messed facilities port a potties\nFood water betting clothing everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers that can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this\nCome back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap or early on you know you're you're actually much more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that\nWe don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum\nThat's what they will do right so it's not a decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just tried to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum\nDefensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song and you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these\n... properly they're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against him they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo butter or in your ear at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where it was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and you know\nYou get justice dispense right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever so it it sort of like that at the border would be what are what you can do so or when you're\nYou're on the right track my friend Bryan writes box still laughing out loud about trying

tenacious so it was quiet and I can tell a lot of you that us all of us that it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that ah that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect floor aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could very well happen so\nWe will see a Josh\nBut I Want to thank you for writing my day after long stressful day it's nice to listen in on the drive home you're accurate depiction of Hillary Clinton's
