that's there there's a whole nother component of this discussion which is that they think that climate change that pushing climate change hysteria is a way to get\nCloser to a one world government and and I know that's that sounds like crazy talk but there's also why ... why didn't liberals have such an affinity for the United nation the United nations has proven itself ineffectual\nSo many times over at its core missions\nUh it it has not prevented genocide despite UN Mandate to do so it has not prevented armed conflict despite you know un efforts to do so and it often give some of the worst\nMost offensive an odious regimes on the planet cover for their activities because you know Libya will be on the human rights council or whatever\nYou know that they they have this fall the notion that all nations should be treated as somewhat equal\nWhen the truth is that there are some there are some there I say crappy governments out there there's some crap hole governments and then there's some pretty good governments or at least in comparison to the other governments pretty good oh and we shouldn't have to treat them all like they're the same but Sanders year when he talks about promoting a shared prosperity\nAnd solidarity that goes beyond any one nations sovereignty\nThe now now you're getting further along into what the progressive and state is with regard to climate change and and these activities the the fixation on multilateral isn't that you see from a body like the United nations\nI that's why I was all because they view the UN is essentially a democracy of countries and democracy is a is an almost fetish eyes word among the left because they think that democracy is an idealized state of all people being equal in all ways\nWhich of course interesting to me is somebody who is a it has an interest in\nAncient history and and western civilization is if you go back to the ... the earliest democracy or ancient Athens in Greece or they only had a very small percentage of the population that could vote you had to be a landowner you can be a slave there was a whole\nI had to be male obviously going to be or you had to be a land owning a resident of it would essentially be the upper middle class or the upper class to be able to vote in Athens in a very small percentage overall so you know the notion of democracy as just everybody gets to vote and they get whatever they want by whatever the majority\nAre ... by whatever the majority says that\nIs not really anything that will be a good government system you can imagine that extrapolating ... even further to what Bernie Sanders and others want here which is all the countries of the world gets a vote on things and then we are held accountable to what all the countries of the world want I don't I don't want to be responsible for what\nIn any way I I don't I don't care what European nations think about\nWhat my rights should be I don't I certainly don't care what Muslim nations thing my

I mean she was a strongly high ... profile I'm ... I'm UN ambassador in part because she was a governor of his state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the uh you know the Trump you\nKnow kind of foreign policy in line to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs investments for\nWell I mean not only was she with this administration she was with the Bush administration ...\nYou know she started off in turning with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of a bunker Trump I think you can really\nUh uh uh ... uh diminish or discount the idea that that are evocative Trump is going to take this position she says she's not going to\nKnow and she's not at all but I I think if they can can cajole or you know twist Dina Paulos arm to take this\nIt will be far better than Margaret now here's the current ambassador to Germany or this girl is God you know she's got all electricity about her and I I mean to wind up managing partner at Goldman Sachs without a bachelor's degree in

you ever seen more up ... in two years with members of the cabinet or his own staff\nThough I I think it's pretty safe to say that ... there's the turnover rate here is a you know a unprecedented on the other hand you know you want people when they are who are you know better and brighter type folks I think Haley was an outstanding UN ambassador\nAh and I think she just had enough of it I think that you know that's a really tough job especially today and you're just button heads all the time I think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that you might even run against Trump but you know this is just absolutely hogwash\nThe likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean she completely

after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus accounts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for Google Plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago I'm\nGoing to be missed what it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been\nVery happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run Google decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or\nHis book so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people to come to regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything with social media scale is everything at Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top of the currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her a bit\nBut apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that while the stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why are there things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why they're petition\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and uh it would have been a lot better off if they had\nIn the meantime all of a food but he was a group of all these years of trying to find other places to go or experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head\nUsing of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably about a good idea of the first place and that the time at ... at the end at the time it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out\nBut as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious wave to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question
