Mayor Bloomberg God Bless that and you all you do as little Bloomberg Espanol ... I I\nThat was great that was great those are similar tires producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know\nThat the euro\nThe snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you know that was only a scene the lousy economy\nI Know we we didn't know we had\nYou see the ... by the way he says the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that\nA major city hit somebody corrupt bill was talking about housing for homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIn cars you liked that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess for our we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real\nLotta stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd you know ... when somebody comes up to him in the gym is a public official\nHe gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy system the man anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's going to run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on a reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nA large number of these stop and frisk hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you had a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist\nInteresting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a\nAs it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped flash\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that you know it looks bad and the and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd and continued downward trajectory on crime but is that\nFor America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know there's just like showing up in\nIn the in the final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like wow it was already happening in the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think that's very fair to make on this is that conservative a lot of ... to stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of the background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAnd the ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about to stop and frisk and Chicago nobody had any ideas for how to make Chicago a less crime ridden place I mean that the number\nShooting people think of ... and I looked at it obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's when we get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weakens with forty fifty people shot you look at the number of shot it in the low it's in a low salaries in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbing a given year that's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lips and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show\nOh you're from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school at come on this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single German or whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household\nThe crime rate is essentially the same across all uh\nAll all cultures and all ethnic background so you can have the structural conversation about why this balance the place of Chicago and you can't talk about more aggressive police and they say that's racist and at\nThe end of that this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being do good or is there protecting civil rights of minorities but you're just going to have having more people getting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton he's running around and demagogue ing well\nAs sharp as what it does struggling runs around and and demagogues on things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from any one of the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away you know liberals would prefer to call Republicans\nRacist and sharp and to to say their dog whistling then to seriously consider a proposal that would save lives and this was the there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in\nYou know a numbers ... numbers based policing a ... that all that was done\nAnd the liberals were howling and shrieking or that too but then they realized oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen\nFor Chicago I Hope they managed to get this violence situation under control that are not going to hold my breath because Democrats are in

there too\nSo despite all the things you hear it right now I I think that we should just remember not only does history show us that\nThis stuff can be wrong I must say it will be 'cause I don't believe anybody can predict the future as you know I'm very consistent with that I think that you can you can have some fun with your speculation on prognostications especially as a political pundit because no one ever forget your losers producer Mike it's like the secret of being a stockbroker just got to make sure you focus on your winters meant\nIf you're right fifty percent of the time but you're really charming guy who tells everybody about all your winters\nVery successful stockbroker only members of losers don't pay enough attention so\nIn politics same thing it's got to make you make a few bold predictions you get one or two of them right and all of a sudden you\nAre the sheer\nOf all things political or the fact that by the way you get\nThe Senate race in New Jersey we Menendez the fact that that's even competitive I Know it's Jersey and I know you're a Jersey resident producer Mike I Know you're you're you're a you're a sophisticated Jersey fellow by the way John

is you're their little their little my you know you're always little Mike yeah so you know they they think of you as being the same thing with me my parents don't like facial hair I mean either\nSent my parents' picture last night I was out some friends in the Senate pictures you know shown where I was and get to respond to his mom offered that are\nBoth like what's with the beard what's going on my mom's like I said I'll send you a raise or how they are\nYeah but this is the stuff that I'm getting columnist from the office so I'm keeping it and that leaves and the officer all fence\nAnd they think the beer that can be very very distinguished like but you know it's a generational thing two beers or in right now if you go back to the seventies and everybody had the uh the you know the

of people that are\nThirties forties lot lot of beers a lot of facial hair a lot of tattoos also\nI remember when you add tattoos if you were a biker sailor and now everybody's got tattoos I just came back from Vegas you can't you go down by the pool and it's like a tattoo symposium or for for 'em or what I mean it's it's like a museum of tattoos when you're out there everywhere and all over the place to look\nI mean I'm fine with it I'm just I don't have any I don't know\nNine out of ten of people that I've talked to that to regret at least one of them or something about it I always get that

Mike and they got to take the are they going to hold the house what do you think Republicans I got a shot\nAbsolutely and when I like it absolutely you're that you hear that producer John ... as you know buck is to shape public opinion yes and in a way off and as\nWe get closer it gets more realistic so the pollsters don't look like fools\nAnd they're going to win anything over as it was\nThen they turn and say well you know we got so many more votes in California than you did in these other states together that is not the way the campaign is here that's not how it works\nYou know nobody would care what New Hampshire I had to say about anything if it was all just to be popular vote contest that's why we have\nA system of of federalism in place in states matter in states are at their own unit of political control\nDemocrats will keep saying oh but I Want a hundred yards the first hundred yards of the mile race as though that's meaningful because ultimately they have no respect for the ... and they just have respect for the power they can get from the system\nAnd they would much prefer to be in a place where uh they can\nChange the system with the power that they have from it right I mean if they could I think they would rewrite lots of rules I mean look we were only the place we're in right now with the Supreme Court because\nHarry Reid decided to get rid of the filibuster is it surprising to anybody that when they had a majority they decided to ah switch things up no but then they act surprise that what we have a majority we use what they use or rather we continue the trajectory of what they did\nAnyway no respect for the actual system that's just a talking point eliminate the electoral college Ocasio Cortez and get as many ignorant millennials as possible to vote for you get as many of them as you can\nTo try and and a sign up and\nCast votes that they don't really understand I must say all millennials obviously talking about the college age kids that don't involve themselves in politics are a lot of people I spoke some college kids just recently in DC very squared\nAway very ... they're all conservatives of course very squared away on

and I've got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it\nThere was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida or just a few days ago\nAnd she held this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support squirrel\nAnd sure enough they had a problem with that because there is a policy that frontier airlines does not allow rodents aboard flight so they they are and she wrote inch at frontier airlines little harsh harsh\nBut I've got to say if you're trying to expand your horizons for what could be a ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and this is really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhich when you see them in the subway to do here in New York City you think to yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying they carry all kinds of diseases but if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make

to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come into the world to be happy\nThe answer is nobody really we are led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more commercial and a self indulgent aspects of the society around this now because we live lives of what would have been inconceivable comfort even even\nA hundred years ago really in terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole and happiness is not just about\nPleasure that's really where the that's really where

little defensive and I have to be aware of that because my initial impulse is to try and cover up the fact that maybe I was wrong on something I think most people are a lot of people at least have

research on it because it was understanding that you know neutrinos generally just stay\nRight during my research I found out they were getting you know from a number of ways large and if you do it well and and just sit there no Nineteen eighty seven eight mhm\nAnd and um and and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried so very very deep in the ground and they have the extremely large or what where are you where it came to my attention is this has been an article where\nAre you know at the poll a media writes in in media or they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's commonplace to find things that just fall who stay\nIn in that and touch region of ... of our planet right um so you know it came to a lot of tension that\nWhat if while they were building this neutrino detector since it has to be so deep in the ground so large\nThat they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been ... you know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nWas he that's a good ... you know in my ... from from whatever they may have filed we're building this detectors or the question is you know where each\nOne is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model operas the right not son particles\nThese aren't new part these aren't these are not neutrinos through the sun's not neutrinos from\nPerhaps the quasars something else these are neutrinos from or what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is it is is somebody that doesn't belong on this planet is being a ... for the Antarctic ... into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular throughout pointed and we're finding their detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the poll you know that that that's\nThat's a bit odd out you know make a magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of beef up the armored particle right and ... and you know\nIt it is really concerns me 'cause we're you know ... ... ... ... detectors have to be very deep underground in Neal with a water\nAnd in in order to you know to detect neutrinos that large numbers of it has to bounce off a particle right have they hit a ... a a heavy water ... you write and what we need it said he'd be water molecule it creates a splash that that the detector can detect\nAnd that's how they detected neutrinos\nNow while they're building this
