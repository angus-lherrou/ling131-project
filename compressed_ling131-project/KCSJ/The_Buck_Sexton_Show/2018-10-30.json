and the drama they bring to the table I mean they ain't I mean imagine if you look so miserable they've noticed that when they're on air how happy they look yeah well you know generally like to go through life buck and so I start to things I'm just putting a ah\nJust putting that out I Know I Know I Try not to go to personal but you know\nThat that's not a good thing that I'm not a what's the word bad karma yes bad karma so speaking of 'em\nIn here but you know she because I was like wait NBC CBS they're both networks other than that they're both full lives but CBS had this uh the second each in taking down hate speech and\nThis has been one of the issues that has you know I've been talking to you about for a long time here where we know strictly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line\nUm and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservative statutes shock\nNo one oh but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite off line they can't get ISIS and these other groups are to be\nTaken out of their face but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second a pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts the activated but here's part of this a discussion and I have a slightly different view of this in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be play clip Thirteen job\nYou can be radical online\nOnline has already been supported by\nThat we believe that after nine eleven when people had access to ISIS supporters and if I played it individuals we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that and have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one it's very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context in a particular case of Bowers\nYeah ... it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle it's very difficult to identify what of hate speech what is not hate speech and is that foreign policy is on that\nIt's difficult to them any leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the\nDetriment of conservatives in a situation where conservatives are the ones who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're enforced against the left at all and and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that Louis Farrakhan\nStill has lots of social media are still is able to view his hatred and tolerance and this is also why I just find so much of\nThe media's\nEffort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all and you know here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets deposed in photos with Rocco bottled journalist hid that in the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there are but Farrah Khan is still treated as

so there you have a pool\nFrom The Simpsons and this comes after the reports late last week now a ... one of the more recognizable characters on that show who is not\nUm but up who is you know about to get written out of the show according to reports from last because uh you can have well a couple of things right he's a an Indian a quickie Mart owner in store owner\nAnd you you can't have you know Indians and seven eleven you're you're not allowed to to have that stereotype anymore in pop culture and media where we've talked about you know the the war on a pool before\nBut now they finally decided that it's not just that there there were some concerns or some\nIdeas out there that they were going to voice a pool 'cause Hank as area who is the uh the guy who wrote voices and that was a white guy\nYou know the whole lot of voices he's a voice actor but he's a white guy voicing a brown guy which is obviously on this for the social justice love it's a big no no but they're actually just going to\nOr at least the latest warning I saw as yeah that's right there are writing him out of the show\nSaying that uh you know that that they're running the show now some people are pushing back on that saying that it's not true that he's not being written out of the show and I I think they are responding to back last year because people were hurt is now\nNow you you can't have this cartoon characters been around for Twenty years and and I would note a pool is yes he's a stereotype\nOr on the show for sure there's no question right he's a stereotype\nBut he's also not ... you know he's a family man is a successful business owner I really mean that I mean it's not\nHe's not often used on the show to highlight the silliness stupidity and ... of other people whereas you know he's actually concrete got a nice wife you heard or on the than the when we came into secondary got a whole bunch of kids he's a business owner I mean you know what a lot of people aspires you in this country for themselves\nAnd and he's not you know there's this big difference between laughing added laughing with\nA pool is I've seen enough of the symptoms of the many episodes certainly not all of them it's been on for one they laughed with character\nYou know you're laughing with it and you find him funny he does insightful political commentary yes he has an accent and yes there is some stairs it's all being used for the purpose of not just entertainment but also a inside and I just think that they're being really unfair to the character but I I Would say this\nYou know over the weekend 'cause the political correctness thing everyone hates it except for the twenty percent of the country are so that are just social justice left\nManiacs everyone hates this cult of political correctness this idea that we can't laugh at anything anymore nothing is allowed to be funny anymore everything has to be treated with this you know this deadly seriousness and just being normal people ah who can laugh at things that a normal person would find funny\nWe all reject this but we find ourselves still stuck in the totalitarian psychological prison all the time of the political correct speech and and thought police but I I I'd rather than get rid of a food than just\nYou know do what they usually do which is either take the character and remove any hinge of humor from him rights\nAnd all of a sudden a pool is going to have like an English accent and be a Harvard professor and just make fun of like the stupid fat\nWhite people like The Simpsons carrot you know that that's one way that they would go or the social justice warriors would want this to go a ... and in another way that they would go in to make social justice you know to make more social justice related points\nYou know now all of a sudden the food so I just I I don't want any of that you know I just get rid of this character then destroy the character I I think that's a\nThat's one movie silver linings holding but it's just indicative of how I don't even know what what anymore because you know it's going to change in a year and not based on humor but based on what is acceptable based on where to left wing draws the and something as\nAs really honestly durable and the comedy world as the Simpson has been around for decades their college are on the social commentary in The Simpsons believe it or not that's a real thing and The Simpsons has really stood the test of time when The Simpsons isn't safe anymore that then you little out there that I find funny\nIt so often the case that humor is now blended with political comments is it's a it's a cheap and an easy way to try to build audience right away what you do is you say going from the left that you hate the right people and then there are more jokes are funny I mean this would be able to Amy Schumer she's not funny\nShe just plays the politics right and people pretend like she's a comedian she's not a comedian she's a very ah you know person a spokesperson or whatever you want to call her pundit who also makes jokes there's a lot of that these days and not a lot of a pool looks like he's gone\nThat's the way this
