locations training veterinary care so much more\nAs a director nothing is more important than making sure everyone has said\n[noise]\n[noise]\nEspecially if you're a what the person is doing is the more difficult thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do 'cause that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff like to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just a vote\nFor a cabin on to get him out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to decide\nSee I investigation and that took whether or not you agree with it that was a gutsy thing to do it because it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTapper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of courage that is called cowardice but notice how this has framed\nThey're trying to you and this is very oh tap are very establishment news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who wants to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's adoptive these are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life you be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way\nCan pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concerned with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and on the right thing he would be in tremendous hot water right now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was this ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham and flake knew it was a ...\nSo what did flake do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw roast funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day than what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interest in power in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's done is just created additional risk for a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been slime\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper doesn't understand apparently it's what Jake Tapper does know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to be able to go and get a contributor ship at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nOr what does the process of getting an FBI investigation was total and complete garbage that's when in doubt tappers got an entirely wrong that's not surprising you know top are always on the on the cold there show always so hip and cool\nThe whole thing overseeing into fraud and staffers the face of fraud and that he is the objective

people are buying what the consumer markets are\nIt's time for this deal to get updated that's what's really happened here the president managed to pull it off any one else will be ... there should be considered a victory but it's Trump\nIs Trump and so the response is always oh well it's not you know it's it's not good enough oh he he didn't he didn't really manage something that's as good as\nYou're being told that is of course told that his by people like me in a a bunch of others but not the mainstream media not the overwhelming\nNumber of media outlets out there they're so invested in telling you that Trump is a bumbling the food that he can't do anything right that he's terrible in negotiation that he has no idea what he's doing this is what they'll tell you\nI'm this doesn't swear at the reality though and you know I'm I'm Out here in this this conference a which stands for research some of you\nKnow them 'cause I Do a podcast with their with their founder and chairman and stands for it's a it's a great group\nI learned a lot about investing in finance from them I really enjoy working with them but they bring out all these experts experts on trade and crypto currency and investing and all kinds of things are just a whole slew of its three days of a world class experts in speakers I brought my buddy Sean Parnell out this year\nJohn did a great job if you ever get a chance to er here Shawn tell the first major enemy contact you had an Afghanistan maybe we'll have him come on and tell us that story as kind of fun I'll\nI'll sit back with all you and just relax kick off my feet on the desk ... oh Sean Scott story time for us\nBut I'm speaking all these different people who are\nVery involved in the markets economy and they have to be right you know that's one thing you get a lot of these people go on TV are all going to cost them a style of across like a number as oh this is what Paul Krugman says\nI'm Talking about people that have to be right because of where they're putting their money where they're investing what they're doing and even the ones that were very skeptical at Trump and there's a lot of Trump skeptics out here that I'm Talking to you\nYou will just capital Trump or saying you can't disregard the results and that's what people want to do I'm not even saying you know you're not allowed to argue that the results aren't as good as people say fine you know people want to quibble over how good the results have been that's one thing\nBut you can't just regard them you can't say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump that did this or Trump doesn't get any credit for this that just\nThat's being unreasonable that's not looking at the evidence and making\nDecisions based on what's well making coming to conclusions based on what's really happening here\nOr there and there's some other stuff that has been said about Trump in the last day or so you had to a union leader a union leader no less thanking Trump for tax breaks play Thirteen\nThanks to Mr ... tax rate farms and they are in\nGeneral confidence in the economy I guess we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company and the last year were investing more in\nIn play wages and\n... and ... says are spending millions on Clinton and I said and\nIn general is the thing is huge increase in and work this coming out because the attorneys are spending more to update\nThe aging infrastructure so thank you very and I made a huge impact\nLooking to grow about ah twenty or thirty percent more and places and the next few months we had a lot of large projects that are starting and um [noise] let's we'll make I think a big difference and\nReally it is and ... that are good for businesses are really important for our employees also the communities we work at it and leave\nAnd thankful and had the ... President Trump for an office\nSo that's a union leader telling you what the tax break has meant for the union that she represents for the employees that people showing up trying to earn a living trying to pay their mortgage feed their families and all this positive stuff she's saying you're you're getting the message elsewhere\nIt's not rocket science folks if you have more money if your business has to give less of the money that it makes if you have to have less of your property taken from you by the government venue or in a better position\nTo invest to pay people more to grow to compete this is\nIt's so straightforward isn't Democrats come up with all these ... theories about oh no we need a higher tax for why should we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world why does that make sense someone explain that to me because we get the best government services for our business is that is a laugh\nAnd it's not even just the tax breaks that have resulted in so many benefits and and so much good stuff going on or there's also the regulatory environment change which I I ... I'm ...

massive government program spending more money on entitlements a trillion dollar stimulus gave away a left wing interest when you think that's the most productive way to use capital you're wrong bad

step in the direction of running for president in twenty twenty I Will tell you this in less the economy has a catastrophic implosion between now and then\nShe as in my mind no chance and I mean no chance of defeating Donald Trump just doesn't have it doesn't have the skills\nAnd I think that she's also already really been marginalized by building a career\nBased on racial fraud that's what you did\nOr that she became a senator because she was a Harvard law professor she became a Harvard law professor because she claimed that she was a Native American on an application there now I Would say that I'm actually\nIn favor of doing that meaning I'm In favor of using the system in that way but only to bring the system crumbling down and to be open and honest about it and say oh no I Know are not Native American but I claimed it\nI think I'm a I think I'm about\nPercent according to my brother's ancestry DNA I think I'm two percent so good I claim Native American status I'm I'm not exactly sure I don't I don't know what it's worth a shot\nBut I don't think war and speaking of a shot I don't think Warren's got a shot and the fact that she's even talking about this for twenty twenty just goes to show you wow Democrats have a very weak bench right now\nAlso this notion that she needs to turn the country around I I keep returning to this\nNo ... this point because I I have to tell you I'm I'm sitting here and I keep saying to myself\nWhat exactly is it the Democrats hate so much about what's happening around us well what is really their objection again we're not starting wars in countries we don't need to be at war in we don't have some ... we we don't have the worst thing happened in this country now so crazy Democrats are it's just the truth\nThere's nothing that's going on right now that you say to yourself oh my gosh this doesn't stop I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what kind of shape are going to be a no that's\nThat's not reality reality is that overall the country is doing quite well overall the country is on a very solid trajectory and you\nCould say it's destroyed the strongest economy certainly since the year two thousand so it almost Twenty years some people just strongest economy more like\nThe senators asked him many straightforward question that needed a yes or no and he threw out red herrings without responded to the question he came

explanations that would never succeed during questioning by any parent or principal or dean doesn't he realized that many of us were there and it's counter shows use of two or three people are like I got I got to tell you I'm\nI I just disagree with everything you're saying Sally and and I say that with respect I think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting\nBut I think that you are not properly ...\nHow a person like having all would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school it doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in\nA in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual did Kavanaugh do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and\nShe's only certain\nThat Kavanaugh's the bad guy I find that a little too convenient I don't believe it I don't believe that her memory is accurate\nMaybe she believes that this happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events squares with reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to either convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so\nDon't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you why I strongly disagree with your entire\nPremise on all of this um or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all of this max\nRight hey buck a with a new FBI investigation look into the will the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background where we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn what she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six years ago\nMax let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for why is it that lousy Ford\nIs a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was ah in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that\nOf that can be discussed ... meanwhile Kavanaugh can be\nTrashed why is that because he's accused\nI'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe it for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken\nSeriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously there's a reason that sexual abuse in many different ... you know many different iterations is a very\nSerious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nUh Jennifer I say there podcast listener here first thank you for being a voice of sanity and reason Andy hilarious at the same time quick question maybe you can help me with this\nIn terms of the lie detector tests what I've seen release was documentation of miss for being asked two questions by the administrator in regards to the statement she wrote but she testified June invasive an arduous process that was longer than she expected\nShe told her whole life story being asked a lot of questions and crying a lot which is it as a person who has had to observe lie detector tests being administered I've never seen a ... question test they are similar to her description under oath long did I miss something and this new cycle it's possible know Jennifer I don't think he missed anything I think the two questions test\nSeems suspect me all along and I think that the whole polygraph in the way that they have been trying to hold this up as the biggest piece of objective evidence they have I think that it's\nA I I think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason and I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here is all coordinated if you didn't want if she didn't want to come forward\nWhy don't you take that polygraph no one's ever given me is\nSatisfactory answer answer that question no one\nRaymond ... unrelated to current political happenings I've heard you speak
