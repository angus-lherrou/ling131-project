McCartney no I'm In treat all sit down with Joe leaving to talking about his new album Egypt Station and of course some discussion about it a little band called the lead off we were a few years when we were playing music or radio present inside the city I'll check it out\n[noise]\nTwo years ago the presidential race I have never seen a ferret [noise] like I see right now I think the Republicans are going to do very well\nTired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts with us so much\nThat they want a strong military they want for executive they want safety they want security we give that the Democrats do not give that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they give it I think we're going to do very very well in the race yeah\nNothing Trump's right I think that we are going to pick up Senate seat something's going to be fifty five you heard it here first fifty five Republican Senate seats by by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although wouldn't that be sweet\nMidterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I I think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans\nAt the end the day but Trump is incredibly\nPowerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well\nWhich are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural edit fish of Obama is them while Trump is ...\nIsn't it and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness and it really is it is moms or jobs\nAnd Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing they're okay and they could be stronger on this but\nOn health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of\nVery unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have a real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm and Obamacare is garbage in Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual\nMandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them you know they are not\nEffective messengers\nOn health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue on the Senate side however\nTed Cruz versus a bet to Rourke a no surprise here Trump is going out there to Stanford Stanford head and I just thought the thought this was a nice moment in your play play quip twenty as Trump's on his way to Texas\nTo have that anymore that\nTexas says that for years and I had a very very nasty stuff\nIt was it was a very uh\nWatch it and we got together and then by the way very late in the cafe we last shot somewhere it's only a voice and then ultimately what happened we bought it out [laughter]\nIt was obvious as we\nWork together very closely I like

the media just cried short thirty eight million dollars oh they're going all in on this guy\nAll in on it and I just feel like\nYou know it couldn't be any more obvious they have very little interest in the fact that there is a much closer than anticipated Senate race for the sheet the Franken seat up in Minnesota you know you'll you'll notice that not a lot of people\nNot a lot of people in the

I Am ... senator don't forget it or do you want of embryo buddy I live on a city called ... you'll\nFind yesterday\nQuote yelling and elected officials in public is protected First Amendment speech and it's pretty disgusting to see journalists lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials\nLiked to fully brain split everything he said here as it is wrong\nIn in ... an hour ... yes it is is protected speech but that's relevant because they're protected speech we're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people but the establishment could get out your trespassing is private property\nThey have that right to you know the the left thinks that the first amendment means they get to say whatever they want an act however they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their right by exercising our right they don't understand this they have no concept of a of\nRights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump but I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their First Amendment right if I you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right\nIf I refuse to give them a permit to speak in a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination that's not respecting their first met right but in a restaurant no you don't have the right to go to a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than he was the right to go to a restaurant and play your\nYou know boom box which we used to have some you remember we used to have those in the eighties and nineties [noise] [noise] the boom box you remember he's carried around with you I\nRemember how cool you were a high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were you know you want to be\nSpeakers then you were really cool I always thought little speakers were much more cynically pleasing and people like why do you like little speakers book\nAnd and one of the speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the we were all sound really public but a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and there's a guy to show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird Buddha Bar lounge music\nAnd and I just think that that's ... ... weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music you know that that's a bold thing to do to inflict on ever bring a Bluetooth speaker with you you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange\nUm and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy wisely at the Washington Post\nIs essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but they're understanding the first amendment is they have special rights in privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that's not how this is supposed to go\nAnd so the Philly brains thing and it just say that were given comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any honest political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me and increasingly said over the last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same\nThat same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president\nThat's going to be a expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was jar\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the confronting people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of ... from arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is a Russian Jew Jenna Russian pond where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work\nThere now pushing out into everything else and you're seeing the same incentive even though we brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell\nRemember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested what you're saying they're idiots and people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no\nIs not\nIt is not and uh I I just think that this is\nOne of these places where you know you either have principles you don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing Nancy Pelosi over the weekend too and they are total moron okay they absolutely should not should not\nOr be given any respect or any you know approval from anyone I heard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that there was a video of people so I'm getting over coal to my voice has been really shaky last week video of people who ... yeah that's right I called I did the show every day I don't miss the show when I'm sick 'cause I Love all have you so much and I can't\nI Can't skip a day in the freedom on unless I have a work thing I have to do but that's where\nA but the people yelling Apollo see they've done nothing to help their cause and a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their causes I'm assuming it's just anti left wing something\nBut the left you are doing their huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false flag I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right and you are screaming and yelling people on the left now you give them the ability to say oh see both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those individuals who are banging on doors and yelling at below sea have done the far left\nA huge favor\nI just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while I said hey mark how's business
