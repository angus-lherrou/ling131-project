live their dreams just like your money when America from our\nChildren's miracle network calmed down [noise]\n[noise]\nOr a cane reports on hurricane Michael\nAre unbelievably disruptive powerful it was the fastest hurricane anybody said it just was speeding if it wasn't that would be absolutely nothing left because I just spoke\nWith Governor Scott they're very happy effort is being now following hurricane being brought in a way of unbelievable large amounts of water and\nAnd everything that people could walk on the electric companies have been a terrific they're already working the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric companies the roads are being claimed right now they're being a for the most part they're open enough to get the electric companies and and\nA lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity is already back on that's in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration is showing competence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins move really fast\nA but one interesting ... first priority the first thought of everybody is getting help to those who needed and making sure that there's\nNo war minimum loss of life and they're going to lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost a but hurricane Michael a hit and you're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will see the political attack ad that was not the case here folks\nAh you had Ron dissent is his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC\nThat is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called them a shady\nMillionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and has a little too much fun so I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running into these attack ads um and and people were pointing out that\nThat this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect\nYou remember there was running attack at the rain jacket in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads\nSpecifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane so usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm\nHas passed and in this case the uh the candidates running these ads\nEven while the while the storm was was overhead and people were trying to either batten down the ... or ...\nOr or wait until they can return to their home by the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home what would it feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with\nAll the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also a illuminates how tight these border\nRaces are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race\nA and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race 'em and they're going to try to extrapolate from that for the implications for the\nPresidential race and twenty twenty you know the idea you're being a ... who's a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies are posing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be um but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic African American um and and that's\nWhat the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see you know minority\nRepresentation and they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives we we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nUh identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days but they really get very excited about this stuff but the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they are getting slammed by category\nOr hurricane to take the ads are taken negative ads off the air so I think that gives you a sense of aware that all is and uh I I\nI Do believe Scott is going to pull it out but you guys going to make is going to make a close very close\nOh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you um and I just I've been waiting to have a night where you know I I'd have the time to read it and we can really dig into it together\nAnd we're talking about this assassination of alleged assassination right now of a critic a Saudi national

their exclusive minimally invasive ... having completed over forty thousand homes or their twenty seven years in business they built a reputation on offering a clean streamlined process for customer convenience\nIs eight ... information's come out that a team of about Fifteen hit men\nAre who were believed to be carrying Saudi diplomatic passports arrived on two private jets some of them are from NBS is personal security detail according to press reports including one who has an expert chief in autopsies\nYeah you can imagine\nAnd that the stories that were reading right now not entirely confirmed for the stories that reading involve a brutal murder of cause I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured and and beat him to death\nA brutal murderer and then just remembering his body putting his body parts into bags and disposing of them in fact one Mideast based paper although it's\nIt's funded by the country so it's you know take it with a grain of salt one Mideast based paper claims they have a source telling them that the body parts of ... so the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story his body parts may be buried in\nThe residents of the consul general of ah of Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi official may may have these body parts barriers backyard\nAnd this is crazy folks I mean this is if you read about this in a fiction novel you'd say come on\nThat so that's so outrageous not only is this not you know this is not the kind of guy you can disappear\nAnd I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are both the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this and nothing happened this is all crazy conspiracy theories you know you could assume all that\nUm but and then that'll give it some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have\nPretty good intelligence and police forces\nAnd plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and for the Saudis to do this on the Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if you went to Saudi all bets are off we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared and nobody would know so they did this in Turkey\nA well keep in mind that a cause show he was a permanent resident of the U.S now he had gone into a a a self imposed a self imposed exile of sorts here in the states\nBut that the Saudis would do this just show brazen and now you have all these different politicians Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay\nYou know I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing and the Kavanaugh hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey but people are saying is going to be held to pay a seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but\nThe overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal broad daylight you know ours assassination\nInside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil ... this is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off\nYou know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely ordered at the very top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top levels of government processed by NBS himself\nThis is crazy this does not happen and people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians have engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be ... former Russian nationals\nThey've done in the u._k. I Know but they've never done it in their former Russian nationals which this guy's a former Saudi national but as for Russian national and\nThey never do it in a diplomatic facility though\nAnd they certainly wouldn't send multiple private jets with Russian officials I'm not saying that the the Russians are to ethical for this they're just not so foolish as to do this but then you get to the ... the then you get to the book then you go to the point where you have to ask ... hold on a second\nTo the Saudis do it this way to send an even stronger message I often tell you on this show and are upset in the past that you know\nIt was burning dung village sends an even stronger message you know we're burning down the whole village and not just one house obviously sent the stronger message too but you don't have to burn down everything you can just make an example of one and here\nYou have a very high profile critic Washington Post columnist who was writing about all of the\nReally what what is a mafia state and the Saudis or a mafia stay with a religious veneer I mean there but Saudi Arabia is a is a a ... you know the ruling family has enriched itself to the tune of\nWho knows how many billions of I mean hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of of decades now Saudi families incredibly rich and the Saudis are as you know very repressive\nGoes all the way back to the unholy\nAlthough they would have thought it was holy alliance between the uh fundamentalist preacher on the Arabian Peninsula even Abdul how from the Eighteen century\nLeave he was born in Seventy two I think he lived about Seventeen Ninety two so liberal maybe Seventy eighty two so Eighteen century preacher who made this deal with the ... who were just warlords and that's how you get Saudi Arabia\nBut they merged together this religious or this religious extremism which is known as ... but they they don't like that term they prefer Salafis and Salafis means the forefathers of the a Muslim faith itself as it whether it's fundamentalism such Islamic fundamentalism\nAnd a ... law Mick\nLiberalism texture realism although even that is kind of difficult to decipher because if\nYou've ever read the Koran and there's a lot of\n'em but they killed that they've they've killed this guy now and it's going to cause some major problems on the international diplomatic so you know I'll get into why and what the what the end result of all this will be in just a moment we'll talk more about this\nWhat looks to be most brazen high profile assassination of a rush that that I can remember\nThey wouldn't be\nSocial media sites are the future of conversation my friends we notice I use it as a powerful tool and reaching out to you and spreading the word about the show and you use it among your friends and family to share your thoughts on everything that matters to you but\nWe've seen so much of the left wing bias at play in the last few years we know that Facebook and Google and these other massive social media enterprises\nHave all kinds of left wing conversational how shadow banning nonsense going on if you want to put a stop to that we've got a new site for you Snoopy dot com\nMaybe dot com is a place where you can go and share whatever thoughts you want you don't have to worry about moderators administrators suppressing your freedom of expression totally free to join check it out for yourself\nAs an I. P. P. Y. that's Snoopy dot com again nippy dot com no censorship no nonsense get the conversation started on the radio on\nIf I die [noise]\n\nIf you need anything from the civil home repairs to a major ... you need to know about home advisor it's a totally free service they instantly connected with top local service from\nAre an interesting side of that you won't hear I think on any other show ... has\n... is not it look he was murdered it was terrible but just if you want a little more background on him he's actually very pro Muslim Brotherhood he's very pro Islamist he is not a liberal in the western sense of the term and an off in western journalists make this mistake they think that just because somebody\nEasy on board with the uh old school\nMideast strongman authoritarian regimes that they must be you know pro democracy for women's rights in fact the show he was very opposed to democracy\nUm he wanted a I'm Sorry they're very opposed to liberalism\nYou saw democracy only as a means of instituting sharia um he was somebody that that believed in using the Democratic process to achieve theocracy whereas what you have in Saudi Arabia is essentially Salafis and without elections he wanted Salafis them but people voting art first\nAs you know once you get to that uh once you get to that place of of having a theocracy elections tend not to last very long in any meaningful way because you don't have the civil society below them to allow for the kind of conversation that would result in democratic process he's been meeting for\nSo ... is not this liberal reformer that a lot of journalists you talking about not not at all but he was a critic of the Saudi regime and you know you have this geopolitical reality and then there's the another reality\nWhen I can say here but I can tell you that a lot of places you won't hear much criticism of this you won't hear it talked about as a story even the Saudis have\nReally spent a tremendous amount of money\nInvesting in media in this country major corporations they're huge shareholders and major corporations\nAnd they also have invested a tremendous amount in some of our most prestigious universities so they have an influence in cultural and information based institutions here that allows them to mute criticism\nAnd that's something that we should all be aware of the Saudis have bought into American American media in ways that lets them call the shots and you won't hear talked about 'cause they're caught a lot of shots\nThey've written very very big checks and are not shy about throwing their weight around on these issues so keep that in mind because when you look at what's going on with Saudi and you look at how friendly all\nAdministration stretching back really for a century now in America are to Saudi Arabia [noise] it it's remarkable and this is\nThe argument the second most totalitarian state on the planet and we act like they're a bunch of good buddies of ours\nAnd it's just for reasons of short term self interest but we should at least be able to be honest about what's really going on there\nAnd I think the murder of his journalists might start that conversation [noise]\nNews radio I'm Brian
