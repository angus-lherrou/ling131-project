senator's ... went to the White House last night centers got access to it this morning\nAnd then the one side saying it's Thoreau and the other side saying it's not enough but we all know they're never going to be happy with it\nUh and then the protests and now the yelling on TV as people I I don't know why these panels on CNN and MSNBC and said well we're going to have one person from the left on one person from the right and\nWe're going to try and keep it simple it's never going to be them all the people on the left are on hinged there is on the ... they accused judge Kavanaugh of\nBeing ... it's real people\nThey're craziness is real\nAlright thank God we have some of the smartest listeners in the world gym in Pennsylvania is checking in Jim welcome to the buck Sexton show tests due to my friend\nHey good to talk to ya\nWhat's ... what's your thoughts on the Korea and Russia situation\nWhile I think myself I think the reason why North Korea is kind of stall out and some of the other issues that we've had going on is because they're all waiting to see after these midterms if Trump is going to get impeached or add more problems because\nIf that happens when they're in the clear\nThere they will find we won't find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump does and that's what they are open for\nThat or just ... you're getting her feet and waiting to see what happens and and our media plays into that too because they keep promote and all that\nInteresting thought gym but I Do think a diplomacy on this level takes time\nI also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are profiting at the mouth going we're going to get the house and they were going to we might get the Senate and we're going to impeach Donald Trump and then we're going to get them out and I say you realize that meets president pen will be a reality and if you think President Trump\nHas been tough on liberals and on on people who are sticking it to America way to use the word President Pence would do and they were going to get him to who we got a plan for him to show I'm not sure about that I just\nI think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress in the Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers being indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut Donald Trump's been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia\nSo I I think it's about time and it's about\nTrump being blustery in his speaking and then the the uh the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps of diplomacy to keep an eye on that gym but thank you ...\nLet's ah stay in Pennsylvania and ah see what's on Felix his mind Felix welcome to the buck sects than shows her\nHey Michael hey I was a big fan of Howard Stern back in the bank and I want to I Want to vindicate him when I went to college in Seventy eight Seventy nine and ... it was very comic to say that girls and women went to college to get the rest of the great\nWell I I understand that we're talking about uh let's go a decade forward and I don't know if the\nM R S degree was as much of a cultural thing in the late eighties and the early nineties as it was in the in the seventies and I think saying in twenty Eighteen\nA rather insensitive to the women today it's kind of insulting to women you I'll tell you what you go to a woman today a twenty five year old woman say why don't you just work out and get your eye Maurice agree to it\nBut what do you go back to that day I mean I Wonder if you go to school or in the early eighties right\nNow in the late eighties he was in high school in the ah that that was the whole argument about this she initially said this happened in the mid to late eighties and then she ... high school was eighty three eighty or eighty four\nFor him so he was getting out of college in the uh late eighties and I think a little bit different back then\nYou know I and I already had a female vice presidential candidate and the same time\nBut eh yeah I understand what you're saying you're saying a stern was making a reference bad but I'm Talking about his references to day you start talking about women getting I'm not exactly sure what that meant\nBut uh I think that was something we weren't supposed to hear or once opposed to say but there it is\nA Michael Palin ... my name is ... the

before the committee submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions he met with sixty five\nSenators and explain this approach the law\nNow all of that has been wiped away by what he calls vicious allegations\nHe said my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted\nMy wife and daughters to face violence and violence threats\nAnd then the face of it all he got a little tense was suddenly called not appropriate\nDid not have the temperament to sit on the court\nI'm Sorry this guy and this\nI'm going to tweet out a

flipping through the pages of the wall Street Journal you know that's one of the greatest papers ever\nSo I Believe judge Kavanaugh and I believe this this will also filter into the minds of some of the people who are on the bubble\nSome of the senators who have not stood up and said what they're going to how they're going to vote by the way senator Shelley Moore Capito\nHas said she is going to vote for judge Kavanaugh\nYour statement probably serving West Virginia and I wonder if this will put a little pressure\nOn a Joe mansion\nThe guy who's\nIn his job\nMaybe we shall see way she'll say there was something else I had to\nGet to today I Know a yesterday\nIt's about a middle of the afternoon yesterday we had that cast of the presidential alert system did you get yours it or to Eighteen east coast time I happen to be playing a little golf I sneaked in nine holes of golf yesterday\nAnd in doing so I was on the golf course in the middle of a back swing when I got my presidential alert message\nAnd it was loud and it was cool and I thought All right that's a good thing and then I saw what Michael Moore put out\nYeah that Michael Moore the big fat guy who makes movies who sometimes gets awards for his movies and he made that Fahrenheit\nNine eleven movie years ago and then he thought wow Donald Trump's election was on ah eleven nine I could do Fahrenheit eleven nine and go after Donald Trump and his movie has been a miserable\nFailure\nSo Michael Moore who believes he's one of the guys who predicted Donald Trump will get elected Michael Moore came out yesterday after the test\nAnd he posted this on Twitter quote it was just to test but make no mistake about it this is the world in which we now live close quote and then he goes on to tell us\nThat's the final line in Fahrenheit eleven nine and he has to tell us that because nobody's gone and seen the movie the movie as Bert virtually a losing money it it was a stink or from the first weekend it was released probably the worst failure he's had\nBut he said that was the last line in my movie Fahrenheit eleven nine a few minutes ago Trump gave us a preview of the state of emergency he is creating to justify the end of democracy as we know it resist\nAnd I'm just wondering what Michael Moore\nWould he be on happy if there was an attack and nobody got him a message or would he be screaming going\nNobody tell me nobody tell me this is getting out\nAnd I just wrote back to him I sent his message back\nTo him on Twitter with a note saying dude\nGet help I'm sure you have health insurance and I'm betting it includes mental health coverage as well stepping aside\nFor a second you want to weigh in on the Kavanaugh conversation we also have to get to the uh South Carolina situation\n[noise] um\nI Know

paying more attention\nUh and uh to my buddy a Randy Sutton with the law enforcement and so much to do and do you the listeners who've\nBeen there throughout the whole show really helped out a one more caller hanging out on the buck phone lines Kenny in Boston Welcome to the show Kenny how are ya\nI'm Mike ... kind of like a an obscure Chester you're all it just might give somebody it\nIt does but it's not it's actually it's a a maneuver that they the Romans used to use they would\nSay for tests don't know but they would say in Latin and uh they would take\nTheir shields that's why buck says shields high\nBecause when you inhale tests do do it meant to put your shields over your head and everybody would then form a like a like a tortoise that's what to do do meant in Latin\nAnd the shields would form this impenetrable barrier so the arrows ... spears would bounce off and they could approach whatever they were going to fight so that's why we yell tests do do and shield tie on this show beautiful\nListen I wanted to talk about the um\nThe test the FEMA tests the presidential alert yeah I didn't get one myself right before when I understand this has been in a in the works or expanding their time of Bush and that and it was expanded under Obama macho include cell phones but it only right now got a implemented\nAnd so this doesn't really have much to do about the timing of it seems to me you know like why now why did it's almost seems like they did not but the thing in Hawaii when they had that alert there and the\nAren't coming off the deep state thing but I'm a little bit of a um stretch there I suppose well you're\nRight when you do the history on it and say started under Bush and then it was approved under Obama and it's just sometimes a coincidental when discovering program finally takes action\nNow is it you know I have friends who say they must know something's going to happen and they want to tell us what what really bothers me Kenny is that now the government's got my cell phone number I already get four million uh unsolicited phone calls a day\nFor people to say did you know you're eligible for free back brace her neck brace push one\nTo get your information push nine to be on the do not call list and I used to push nine\nBut now I realize when I push nine all it says is they can sell your number to somebody else they can sell that number to someone else who's going to then call me ten times a day so I now push one and I talked to him\nAnd and I try and engage them because the longer there on the phone without making the sale\nThe I'm frustrating that so I'm doing it so you won't we won't get that call but I don't know that that ... ferry is\nUm you know Michael Moore thinks it is but I don't it just bothers me that now the government has my cell phone but they don't have yours you didn't get a call\nYeah there's I I didn't get finished reading it but there's an article on line and it says some people did not get a call now I did not get it\nWhen you consider yourself lucky unless there's an attack then you're going to be walking around and go where the health everybody going\nThat all of us\nYeah may maybe just might keep your eye on everybody else you you can't miss it like I said I was on the golf course in my phone's they're gone and ... or whatever was\nYou're not supposed to make the noise 'cause then I'll make a mess but Kenney a I got to I'm almost out of here the Soros machine is approaching rapidly quickly do you think Kavanaugh gets through or not\nA I'm going to give it about a Seventy

sixty five and went down to one Ninety five my doctor told me that that works for you then do it but a lot of people said how would you lose the weight I I think Andrew four hundred every day and I'm going to take it wherever\nThat was Walt talking about Andrew four hundred now listen to what Bob has to say\nWhen you listen to your radio commercials you say that's not possible sense I've

our Monday through friday from poor am individual needs to be I'm right here\nYou know your neighbor and your child's teacher but do you know your judge\nColorado judges are vital members of our community they make they make decisions about adoption child custody traffic violation and mark this November educated\nYou know and treat the people involved like the metaphors and and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional lobbying\nAnd that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very bad places you know I had to when the Gramm had a ramp during the\nDay I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population and increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates pulled out its because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record\nWhat it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment the constitution\nSo I think he's apt to bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go and that's what's going to give some of the moderate you know problems and so but my guess he he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things that's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's

of all of this\nAny any time any one of the things talk act supports the violation of due process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial

lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and what\nWhat saved me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law\nAnd it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me so we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um\nYou know I think I think that a lot of the people uh you know who've allow themselves to be weaponized oh oh ah\nOh an apology to to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership of the Congress those American apology\nWe shall see how this all
