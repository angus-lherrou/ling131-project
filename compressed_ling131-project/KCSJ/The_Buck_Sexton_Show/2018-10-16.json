retrospect do you think [noise]\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you that where's the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made and which have dismisses denies ridiculed [laughter]\nThat's what she had nothing to do with anything you see\nIt was only her husband who was a serial abuser of women who was credibly accused of sexual assaults by women on the record with full facts and the stories ready to go\nMedia didn't want to cover that you see this is where I I just I I take a moment because I Want to step back and make sure\nWe all are on the same page when it comes to the narrative of the moment here\nShe the narrative of the moments in the left is that oh what Bill Clinton did then she would never be\nAble to do now you see it's different because of this me too movement it's different now Bill Clinton's ah what will be called the ... what what is it like to call them his his personal failings very ... way of saying Bill Clinton being a predator\n... most of the largest you know I mean aren't Okonjo showed a curse word the oval office but all too much much worse stuff in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nDisgrace\nOr it's something that the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye to eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was part of the Clinton machinery for example\nAnd he is treated with with ... and he's a hundred million dollar men now ABC\nNews anchor that has to be ... who decides to pay that much money it's it's just an astonishing thing it really is oh without Stephanopoulos who would watch these shows everybody would watch these shows these are platforms wherever they put in these roles is going to get a certain amount of viewership\nBut he seems to get a excused from being a part of a country machinery and Hillary who just had her clearance taken away I mean Hillary just\nWas finally told you don't get to have a security clearance anymore for jury on flagrant violations of national security protocol for anybody who has a clearance she was just told that now she still hasn't\nRaised show has been achieved even a modicum of honesty you could say to bar from Obama\nSmoking smoking um honesty she doesn't have a smidgen of honesty she's such a liar and she knows that she well she still thinks that she has a a political future and it would be a problem\nFor her the left has gone show all in on this whole\nMe too movement they've made this such a a prominent part of what the left and for now it's the ... movement of the moment I we've had black lives matter or we've had Occupy Wall street we've had these different a political ... revolutionary\nLeftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in\nSome time just just wait for it but in the meantime they have to make sure that they don't have the weaponization of some of these things occurring back on them\nThey don't want to score and their own goals here with the me too movement and that the enabler I've always felt that the enablers in this whole process we're getting off far too easy you know the people men and women around someone like a Harvey Weinstein seeing people men and women around someone like\nA Les Moonves you know those who were\nNecessary in this whole process of predation they they don't get in trouble they don't really get called out and Hillary was the ultimate in that not only did\nShe stand by her man of course as we know for the most obvious and a self interested political reasons imaginable bushy went on the attack against these women and whenever I hear people say things like don't they have a right to be believed\nI was wondering respond well to the women that Hillary demeaned I mean did did the women that were completely attack verbally in the media down to their very character\nThey were all considered to be fighters for the cause at\nThe time and there has been no accountability for that whatsoever and there's no accountability to stay for Hillary when when she held accountable for the fact that she was\nEssential in her husband's not just denials but continued book flagrant violations of the public trust and an overhaul Bill Clinton was accused of rape folks rape not just your ... and I really don't like and this happens you know this usage of the term\nSexual assault and sexual harassment being conflated with sexual assault and all of a sudden people are like well you know both sides have their problems you've got Clarence Thomas on one side Bill Clinton\nOn the other no Clarence Thomas was accused and I don't think particularly credibly accused of saying some inappropriate stuff in the office I mean a worst case basis Clarence Thomas should have been pulled aside by age aren't told hey you know knock that off there's going to be professional consequences that if he did it I think he did it\nBill Clinton could have spent decades in prison for what he did the allegations against Bill Clinton were of of rape by force and that's\nThat's going to send you to prison for very long time in your life is essentially over and he went on to be the president of the states for eight years so yes Hillary coming out now and saying that she wasn't a part of any this\nShe lies now with such fluidity and so shamelessly I Would tell you all if you if you want to have a a quick and fun read go back and read Christopher\nHitchens no one left alive to [noise] Hitchens was one of these he was a leftist in the nineties and was still a really is a socialist kind of a reform socialist all the way to the very end clearly an atheist but he was somebody who just couldn't stomach the lives of the Clintons and the big lives I mean the very obvious\nIn your face self interested lying up the Clintons and he wrote a book called no one left ally do and he just goes through how the Clintons were just lie about stuff

presidents are certainly all Republican presidents stretching back for my whole lifetime\nUh we're in a position where they felt they had to suck up the media maybe you only exception was Reagan but the rest of them felt like they had to suck up to the media or else they're presidency would really suffer because the media had so much power and so much ability to sway public opinion instead Trump is like you know what you think you're going to push me around is going to push back\nAnd he did he did a fantastic job and that Lesley Stahl interview but\nThey still can't leg loving 'em at at this

is back [noise]\nMaybe I'm particularly attuned to this right now because of the madness that we have seen just just today a with regard to this Elizabeth Warren DNA\nFiasco this this self inflicted wound that uh that Elizabeth Warren now has ... and and it reminds me though that that's the last\nReally is increasingly a just just\nLosing his mind I mean there's nothing that you can really say any more of that is an extension of their previous\nBeliefs there's there's nothing that you can really say and think well there's no way they'd ever make that you know ... ... if I'm trying to make a point about the extremes of what they believe and what they think they wouldn't go that far\nWell it it turns out that we're running out of\nAreas where that is still true it it turns out that there are very few things that we can point to and say oh they would never they would never allow that thing to happen anymore because those examples that we used to use are increasingly now the reality on the left\nRight so this is that this is the perfect example you have the Daily Caller with a piece that a biological male\nWho identifies as a transgender woman\nWon a woman's world championships cycling event on Sunday you know Rachel McKinnon a professor the College of Charleston won the women's sprint thirty five to thirty nine of age bracket at the twenty Eighteen UCI master's tracks cycling world championship in Los Angeles\nSo we have somebody who's the first transgender woman world champion ever and we're supposed to celebrate this do they really expect us to celebrate\nThis is supposed to be treated like it is in some way a victory a victory for whom I advocate for transgender rights\nCertainly not a victory for women the reason that we have sex segregated sports is not because of sexism and maybe this is where progressive Z\nJust can't follow the logic training or maybe they just are unable to understand this but the reason we have sex segregated sports\nIs because men are overwhelmingly and invariably biologically larger heavier stronger and faster than women as a function of hormones and genetics\nThat's just that's the truth I mean I\nI used to occasionally with some friends of mine a scrimmage with some of the women's varsity teams when I was in in college and then I can tell you that I a reasonably athletic\nCollege male would probably be a three sport superstar for most female programs if he had had some of the of the same skills by playing let's say on a high school team I mean that's just the truth\nBut that's why we have sex segregated sports but the leftist show devoted to this idea of transgender rights in transgender resume as something that must be celebrated remember I've told you the the way that the progressive approach these issues is it starts with just just tolerant be tolerant\nAnd then it's you know be inclusive and then it's celebrated and then it's you know\nExcept willing to accept this or else which is basically a version celebrated but they they always have this sliding scale and it will start just with oh just tolerate it that's the first thing\nAnd and then you have to you know later you off from it and then you'll be told to celebrate it that's I skipped affirmed to celebrate their before but here we have it I mean if I told you five years ago\nThat we would see pieces about how men could compete in female sporting events because they say they're transgender and that would be considered fair somehow on the left\nYou'd say buck that's just crazy and I would say well yes it's crazy but now it's true now it's happening\nA this that's why these here you have this is the ... this was the women's world championships women's world championships and uh you have your men competing in these events now\nThan the whole notion that we have to say biological mail I Would note is a misnomer because male is a function of biology as his female we can pretend to these things are separate we can pretend that they are distinct but we're just only fooling ourselves and\nAnd it can't be a shock to anybody that are on a day or it shouldn't come into shock that on the same day we were told that somebody can claim to be Native American because they are point point point zero zero zero zero zero one seven whatever Native American and not even really Native American\nI I think that there's ... there's an adaptation going on in my thinking and it's maybe something I've been a little slower than some of my other colleagues on the right to adopt in some ways because I come from this perspective of\nWell this'll sound self aggrandizing but knowledge having a background in in the actual work that I Do especially in the national security side knowledge and facts and wisdom that's how I tried to approach would I Do and and so I always want to think that I could have\nLiberals listen to this show when I certainly hope to all the liberals who are listening that they still feel this way but I Want them know that I I Want to bring them over to my side\nA and I don't want to be too strident that has always been my approach but recently the left has gone insane and so I Am separating out in my mind\nI Want to say in saying I mean more insane than usual I separated in my mind how I speak to Democrats really in general from how I'm now speaking to the hardcore left because I Am an ideological war with the hardcore less a centrist Democrats\nI Want to come over to my side not necessarily even on everything but um whatever they're willing to\nBut the hardcore left just must be ideologically smashed and and destroyed it must be defeated you know the ... the ah the people that are running around with the pink hats on and that are saying due process doesn't count anymore and\nThey they the ones who are doing deep platform and want people to be boycotted and to be fired from their jobs for\nExpressing conservative opinions we we have to fight that ideology not not meet it in a gentleman the contest but we actually have to throw some elbows\nAnd that that maybe has been a a learning process for me in this Arab Trump because I've seen more and more of what the left are not just with the left is but how much of the Democrat Party and how much of the ideological a center left they control\nAnd the hard left I mean the progressive vanguard each way to prominent way too powerful and can and cannot be a just wished away any more so if I found that all like I'm a little more strident or a little more uh fired up about things in the last few months it's really because\nI've seen what this battle we're entering into is all about\nAnd this is political total war this is not a you know made the best man when this is one man will win and one man will not leave the octagon so to speak and in that kind of political environment you ... you have to be ready to to go bare knuckle an end in a sense that's really what I've learned from Trump you know there there have been some things\nThat Trump has Donald Trump is said and I thought oh my gosh that's such a mistake oh my gosh how could Trump if have gone with that that's so that's so foolish of and that's so silly and then within a few and this happens less and less now because I realize we're dealing with with Trump\nOr and then time passes and I realized wait a second he was right\nTo apologize for that they would have just mould him like a like a ... I was gonna say a flock of ... but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging per on us or that they they would have torn apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or is when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people or how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and an objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well\nAnd make changes I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear everyday yes I like to present information and there's an aspect\nOf this that's a really just about there I say ... community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I equip\nThose listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs I ... explain not just what we should all thinking about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and and yeah I I Am also in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and and it's never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time\nBrad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she make such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty\nI'm a loyal pod cast listener and wanted to thank you for releasing your podcast earlier so us folks up here in Alaska and listen to it on the way home ... thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked the pocket gases out sooner and I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast now is that we're pretty much now our\nPodcast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show in drive time on the west coast\nSo you know ... there's no problem with you decide and that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to a lower early ... you don't have to wait you have to wait for it to be rebroadcast her to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nOn the podcast however you consume podcast or and so that's great news and you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary and her security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just\nCompletely it should've been terrifically embarrassing or for anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense that she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nWhat am I knew all that just this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends that stands for research\nThere'll be about what's coming next in the markets and big big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full [noise]\nLive event this Friday just go to buck event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register for free all free book events dot com and getting ...

industrial deep state which is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I Divide that this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreeing with the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order that wants to take over go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\n[noise] ... yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things to just didn't ring true to me about how you feel name could so he\nCould show games like Amazon gift show gets ...\n... you know you had the church came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put it on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit but they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is\nHave you ever heard of a of any nation state funding Fifteen people to do it\nI mean if you're if you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill people you have in a in a place like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true\nBut Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but you know\nFeet does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nWould have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of a worldwide deep state manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish it were to look at\nAn other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil's going to start going up I think to moral can be a very bad day in the stock market is is this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when cars show ...\nIs a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states as a consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia\nBut you know watch him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed in was dismembered and they flew his remains I Can't remember the food too but uh the gloom out of the country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the hit team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason uh you said that he was in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey may be arguments the CIA was facilitating operation deep said opportune argument that he'd said operatives in the eye a\nPoor facilitators to the murder of this uh uh I'm a ... and of course Saudi Arabian\nUs to be said operators were involved here as well now if turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too but what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more because of Trump's pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that can happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling we do need to do that while I have a feeling though that's\nWhat they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you've got Bolton who
