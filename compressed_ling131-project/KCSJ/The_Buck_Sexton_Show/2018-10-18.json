{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "I guess it was one of my goals but mine but somebody else screams very drawn quitting on not at all thing and then when he went home and it was over the weekend he realized oh my gosh what am I don't I don't have a job a that was a great job I made a terrible mistake and then he didn't know what to do and thought and falling thought and then he figured out you figured you know what\nI think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details\nAnd he just showed up to work on Monday I Pretend to like nothing had happened and it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and he just you know they maybe they forgot to melt the outer just chose to ignore the whole thing but they wanted him there and he showed up at everyone just what about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what it lives with one thing she's going to do when it comes right for the presidents I think are approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing\nDidn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show um that's not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is the descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan use ... with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked the Pocahontas but yeah it's fun\nI mean the best you should actually you know I you know people are gonna get married for this one I think you got to figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tied for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck in neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the beast although no it's a little more for him to be a little more for the ladies but it's very well done with the first animated film ever nominate for Oscar okay bakar poker\nBack to a descendant of the real Pocahontas so you have it ah what what you saw here was that the left\nHas this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say\nUm you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture boroughs and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a you know getting a pattern from Malaysia ... let me think of as a very ... be\nNorthern northeastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native American specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cookbook called powwow chow\nAnd do all the recipe from my real French chef and called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be the next president of the states by the way you know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know there's\nThere's there's certain things that you\nCan feel a little bit of a personal understanding\nOf it and say you know what that person may be crossed the line with that or\nThat went bad but\nI can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it a being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are and and I played\nThat story for you yesterday was she talking about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really\nTheir parents were or\nYou know the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren\nAbout a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back Native American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but\nCultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again unless it oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume although I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can we get some normal people involved oh who had\nSomething about this Halloween you don't wear costume that's offensive to any culture or a culture ancestry or whatever\nOkay so now that means you know no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white\nFor a Halloween then so is it really just white people that aren't allowed to dress up in and cultural gar\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing but\nI don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's write off for you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a underrepresented indiscriminate minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups\nAnd I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes right to use those groups for their own power so close to appropriations they stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did knock cultural appropriation\nThere is no such thing he does not exist even for ...

Republicans way\nAnd then the same time she was saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from anything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds me of what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh\nTravesty that was televised for the whole nation is after all of that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried to enrich your lipstick fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees with us ideologically that's all it was\nWasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nWas the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have

so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves have to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did to him gloves off I'm Sorry I mean gloves off after what they did a cabinet could only mean\nViolence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just there's nothing else you know that if you're going to take it to the level of because remember\nThey didn't just want to destroy cameras turf they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him

Kevin on not just stop him from the Supreme Court they would do anything as long as it was going to destroy\nAnd they thought that wasn't enough they thought that was playing by gentlemen Lee

yourself stay strong and when\nI'm now seeing the wisdom of Donald Trump telling us all that we're going to win so much we're going to get tired of winning we need you\nThe alternative is putting

again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message\nNow I Need some advice to help resolve the political dispute\nMy dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in an upcoming state election in Mississippi\nWe're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of light and who perhaps has been involved and questionable a pub a publicity schemes the other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either\nBut for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust to vote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion\nKatie Katie a very very a thoughtful question from you thank you so much riding in\nUm who do well you know\nSince I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this is just a question of establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations this is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want or acts the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want and a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue with it\nI think that ah principles are most important for you and your day to day life the principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and to have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless so I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of image look what happened with justice capital\nI I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now that varies I mean there's there's people that are shady and there's people who are who are grotesque and and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take a trustworthy\nOn policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over a upstanding\nBut legislatively on palatable Democrat I suspect\nRobin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive
