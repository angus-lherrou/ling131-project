{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "These you know the now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for as an adult at least and for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up\nRealizing that you don't really want to eat candy all the time you know you don't really want to be in a position where you're just constantly ... on racist pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces\nYou will find yourself at some point do have eaten all the M. and M. and m's the most the most popular candy in the world\nThat's right ... number one it was a random aside I almost a started\nWorking when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I've got a job\nOffer at a I forget which I don't remember what it's called out but some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy and I'm pretty sure it was the Mars account which is a M. and m's so I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take me thank thank God that did\nAh but yeah you read all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reaches level where you're like I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore and that\nSo you learn that as a kid and that but that as an adult as a guy you know you\nYou get to be a rather than women tend to dress some women some without a lawyer like buck I dress like a um I dress like a witch and not a naughty which put a scary one they do whatever that's that's cool but\nSome college age and and ... and older young women tend to dress in\nMore provocative fashion so Gonzaga is worried about this and also is a reminder for me the cultural appropriation which has gotten all this attention right now or the or the holiday season cultural appropriation is not a thing\nI it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because culture doesn't belong to anyone or any group\nCulture is just a way that things are done a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution and the only way that culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only be part of the general cultural ... most is\nLike that for a lot of fun fun word there that everybody else is engaged it as well\nBut now I also remember some of my my\nBest and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume that you're either very embarrassed about are very proud of\nDon't be showing don't I don't think I've ever dressed up\nAs an adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I oh I see\nHow it is I see your call me out now I see what's out there is producer Mike is he going is he talking to a naughty nurse right now are sea within earshot of the microphone\nI think he's talking to a naughty secretary over somewhere that that sounds that sounds about\nRight or you know every every time I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike is he's out getting phone numbers um but I and I could tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC I found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween party\nAnd I I uh theater supply store and they let me read because you want to get really high in costume and not spend a lot of money got rent it and I rented a full on theatrical production costume slash kind of\nUniform replica of general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the ... and a pipe and the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costume was legit by the way tend to lose\nBe surprised how much attention to the ladies give to a guy walks around wearing wearing the ... so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year or with the kind of a you know the seventies style tennis out fix I just basically\nShrank a a shirt and a lot in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band than an hour wouldn't tennis racket\nSo that worked out so I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who\nIs is quite as up on on their costume game as many others but I Hope if you do go out this weekend\nAppropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it this is America a but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpiked a trauma candy corn pumpkin juice to ... candy corn roster cheat as your ... you know this site and somebody might finally appears some ask somebody what ... what is your what is your best or worst or both Halloween costume and you can remember\nI was never a huge Halloween guy I mean the ... but other than it thought I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friends did a group thing and we did the ah\nAddams family and uh I was ... Adams I'm\nAnd that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and at the individual people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and then but then when he got altogether it was like you guys are awesome\nSo that was a sort of on\nNice Halloween parties\nThat ... I Know I'm more right\nFair enough you know and I will eat candy and I will give out the candy but er what is the best Halloween candy\nGood question I mean I I'm a I have a huge sweet to so I don't ... I go to resist visas for me like if I'm if I'm able to just pick any candy I think Greece's pieces is yeah it was pretty spectacular ... considered\nI'm a we actually got into this conversation after the other day I'm ... I'd like to freeze some of my candy and I think when you go frozen the Milky Way it doesn't get a whole lot better than that in my opinion\nWow yeah I I had not thought of that I Do know that ... for all those listening\nIf you ever like make brownies and you don't want to eat them all at once and you keep it in the freezer and then you want to put them in the microwave the you'd do maintain freshness baked goods frozen is actually a very smart thing to do yeah\nI didn't learn until like a couple of years ago and it's apparently they didn't they didn't teach us that in CIA school [laughter] so ah anyway All right yeah good good good times producer my concerns were going to come back we got our buddy Benny\nJohnson in the mix and then we've got a Stephanie\nHamilton kind of like a double dose of the Daily Caller this Friday on the show\nAnd you know before I actually did a sit down I did the federalist radio hour which the podcast today [noise] with Mollie Hemingway who's just just so cool she's great so good on on Fox so a lot of content that they oh by the way I'll be on ... show tonight at eleven pm eastern\nSo talking about all the stuff bringing all the truth of wild stuff [noise] and uh I'll be back in just [noise] the FBI calls home\nBut also have to one of the fastest growing crimes my friend's brace yourself if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for when the steals your homes title everything's online these days including your home settled domestic and international thieves\nHunt American homeowners because we have equity in our homes and the bad guys are stealing it may take you off your homes title an add an alias than they borrow hundreds of thousands using your homes equity and stick you with the payments you won't know until you get a late payment notice\nIdentity theft programs and insurance policies don't protect you\nHome title walk safeguards your homes title from cyber thieves and hackers by putting an online perimeter around your homes title\nThe instant detects on tampering with their own it to shut it down for pennies today home town of law protects my most valuable asset my family's home you needed to register for a free now says you have your homes title has been compromised it's a hundred dollar value free visit home titled rock dot com\nOr in college or in a row Super Bowl champions aren't the most important contract of his life to serve in the Army National guard\nOr a lot of military my friend was for for what's all my family's overall I Want to go out there make a difference and find the working behind the desk so familiar in ... minutes from our country was hard for them\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard logged on to the national guard dot com sponsored by the Colorado Army National guard\nBroadcasters association of this station Casey\nColorado's dependable accurate ballots [noise]\nFive Ninety ...\nThree open community um floating in the mid term elections because no every boat make that my opinion matters or vote I vote\nIn the mid term election to register to vote go to I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to vote Tuesday November sixth sponsored by her immediate and acidic culture coalition\nYeah and I think that ah people are starting to have second thoughts about whether or not he should run for president that strikes me as not the best move\nUh no not the best movie you've happy my question was that the un and the name of the\nMajor cheerleader from an ID or you have people at CNN or making sure that ah his name is starting to move down and the DNC a presidential candidate less or he is a Christian was said maybe it's time for us to rethink like body as being the front let her\n\nKnow I I got on how's it going to have you been ... Halloween Halloween is a holiday that some of us think\nOf as um you know for kids where do you come down on this issue\nOr it's not a hunting for kids\nIs it a holiday for kids should adults dress up I'm going to be getting into a whole sexy costume conversation coming up in a few minutes and then you know where you come down on this issue should adults we dressing up for Halloween\n[laughter] ah well I mean\nJess ... there's been a major issues in the new fight we problematic ... I think Megan Kelly had a part of this week about a\nEssentially defending it must be defending black me I don't want to do but she just doesn't have a job anymore she has six nine million dollars and our bank account oh that's great if I may Michael I guess it's be fired by NBC and to get Seventy million dollars or so um\nBut yeah I I don't I don't remember the problem here are dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh for Halloween and I'm going to wear a I've got just outfit and I'm Out of gas or an imam sign around my neck and says I like beer\nAnd and that's going to be like Oscar\nI I don't I don't really understand why a what would be you know what would be problematic for this or advocate or an adult\nNow on the Megan Kelly thing ... you should do or show back in the day at Fox I feel like you probably were in the mix for\nThat um she was the first person that ever ... ever put me on prime time at Fox oh I said yesterday that I feel like I have some you know as\nI have a certain fondness for Megan but then again I think she made ... incredibly bad decisions when it comes to leave it how she left Fox wins you love box where she went from Fox but to me it couldn't be more obvious they just wanted to get rid of her I mean this was really the ... what you said really wasn't like fire rubble offense\nWell no on the fence I mean this is sort of what happens in the media is I think that\nNBC ... looking for an excuse to get rid of backing Kelly rating for taking a she wasn't fitting into the network and I think they just is is that the number one opportunity I say there was a major that was a major conflict\n... this is the same that work but kept Matt Lauer around for decades and this is the thing that work that wouldn't want Ronan Farrow to public reporting on R B once seen on our website so this is a huge double standard\nYeah and and I I gotta say this is where we'll also see the one of one of my maxims is that the less takes care of its own where you can get terminated or on the left unless you were actually unknown predator or something really\nTerrible you know you're actually doing something that's border line up to and including the criminal or you can\nHave a second act I mean you've already seen who's the guy who ah the comedian Louis sea caves coming like these other people\nI think men Kelly's done I I don't think that you know may maybe she'll be a you know selling slow cooker is only the home shopping network or something but I don't think any major networks going to give her another shock because there's only one place where to go and she left\nThe Megan Kelly in a like infomercial for a you know to ... stay cookers would be amazing yes ah that yeah that would that would be that would be absolutely amazing but you're exactly right I mean who's going to figure out I I have no idea I I I just live on fire all of her credentials with conservatives\nAnd the concern was really loved her over ... bc\nAnd then the people that you see the left at NBC they didn't like her and the first place so they ... both sides on fire so where does she go from here and she's not going back to Fox\nAh and I\nYou know and I don't think anyone else is going to see the investment of studying million dollars are really being a meaningful or worthwhile investment because she didn't never delivered on reading\nAnd and and what university were Seventy million dollars by the way I mean ... whose idea we have\nI don't know that we're ... interview remember that that was a big break out she went and interviewed ... and\nIt doesn't even speak English how much of an interview to that really be let's get serious ... second she can't even communicate with him\nEveryone criticized driving up and down for what you are for firing for the sex and feel for everything uh it just didn't work out\nAll right for Kelly that'd be the ... and ... on the ticket disaster or the leading Fox was a huge huge issue and people that are you just got

really clear on exactly what you're asking me here buddy but I Do appreciate the ... note thank you very much\nRe Wright's book since it is technically invasion can Trump declared the border a war zone and limit media access so they can't use the pictures of the poor women and children just wandering thanks\nRay I don't think that\n[noise] well you know I think that maybe he could declared a national emergency but I don't think he'd be able to court a war zone practically as we know only Congress can declare war but here's where things get interesting\nBecause I explained to you that in terms of what the law is now and we're Congress actually is on this issue of the border and immigration\nThey can claim of this caravan can claim asylum and there was nothing to stop them necessarily from that\nBut the president as we know from the whole kerfuffle over the Muslim ban does have the ability to declare any group of aliens to be a problem for national security purposes and to borrow them entry to the United states\nTherefore the president put under his national security authority as the commander in chief and this is in congressional statute right now the president could say you're not allowed to come into this country because you were a national security threat on the commander in chief that's just the way that it is this though\nWould be challenged immediately in the courts the press would completely freak out on on this whole situation as you can imagine\nAnd a ... I'm not sure how it would even be resolved but I Do think that that just war gaming us out a little bit that could happen as a keeping the press away I'm not comfortable with trying to prevent the media from seeing something that's actually going on so I I Would not want that\nTo happen um I don't I don't I think the media should be\nAble to report on what's going on in war zone or the media should be able to report on pretty much anything that's happening here with the possible exception of things that are a him in a national security risk you know troop movements in a like a aries\n...

healthy love for freedom and our constitutional republic lately I think Republicans fears of felons voting is misplaced this is purely anecdotal but all the possible lip voters I encountered in prison probably wouldn't go to uphold their lives depended on it and not very impressive people that's kinda where they send us keep up the good fight shields I in Georgia\nMatt Matt\n... really interesting to hear from a man I appreciate getting a perspective from somebody who has a serve\nTime for a felony and can speak to what it's like being a prisoner and also what a what the\nPolitical vibe is on

charged with something potentially explosive packages to leading Democrats President Trump calling for a change in the rhetoric\nIn recent days we've had a broader conversation about the tone and civility of our\nAnd he said it was you know really made is made out of great ingenuity but he said that he will hardly think I shall meet the test its power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual movement and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today got his start in Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point\nSo there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada\nLots of rights from the United states to sell their own version of the wage aboard and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so bored such as Bob sport which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into the market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this has been a spiritual moving with going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat board and started doing different types of their own type a\nBoard and of course we ... the trademark tens of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspect\nSerial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself or what have you ah in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned people didn't act around and start customizing selling them\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money ... there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In its I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really whether or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is the avoided\nA any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling\nOn on on would just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for current affair which is an old TV show or on a which has only channel five or something right in the east and um\nHe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like um show heated like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level I think it's the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they put it down\nSo they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but um it's the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know not to and I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary\nAnd if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some bad that people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to send them back\nSo I always say that it's not a joke ...\nNo I'm In I'm going to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time was beyond as ... used to board\nA gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use them and you know boards rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you can go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards there or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into naval due to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ... he started developing really started really being fine tune\nAnd taken about the way I can still do this work and be a lot of people is in the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement\nMovement itself that kind of opens up the receptor seek to start bringing in the information right and so again I might be required to board does know negative energy with any boy that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so\nPeople doesn't mean you know people in these scaring us even talking about this on the radio while I have\nAre though they they they think in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and now it's ... motor responses are that are basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions and the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters\nAnd so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip in a way to to view I mean people would use pencils that I I used to know a medium that would ah would he would do his thing he would just scribble he would\nTake the pencil and he would just scribble on a new bad and he just scribbling scribbling as these scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at this go on all I see a scribbling but what I used to what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of\nI don't know doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information from getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the city of motor response but certainly is a interesting and you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking about Bob's warrior care and\nA dominant program who is the director of the talking more Historical Society and seen are all over and she's been a guy or a guy who showed beyond belief she's been a

lot to really tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what\nHappens to the body after he died called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she just love it you know she's great\nAnd you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nFew huh [laughter] well\nFirst of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I walked Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... one of the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works
