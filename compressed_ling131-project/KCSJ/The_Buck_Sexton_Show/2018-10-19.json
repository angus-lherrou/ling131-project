creation is services so when you're a service economy\nThe way to stimulate your economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to state anything that raises the price of a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government as a tariff it's just another tax\nBefore we're close out here it's a real quick here to get from a great on the economy a threat what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents a pretty good regulations are on and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader\nAnd there is such a thing as subjectivity\nIn in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way\nBut the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound is not lasting it's based on that and the payment will come too soon\n\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and NFL through saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were ... years right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Wal Mart and\nI was going to say here's our IDs years all righty but these are very different views\nOf what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul um let me let me they will drop off at first I was from an interview we did on rushing by the way we're going to speak to for Congressman Paul\n[noise] ah [noise] he's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is a\nVery clear history of the currency you are in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity\nIs very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that\nShed Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not found a way too much debt and all that she can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't want to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have ride telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I think that's ever going to happen but even if it weren't true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand and eight we came up on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I\nPut his I put his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and\nEspecially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt we got to remember that\nWe're we're heading into we're heading to a bad place might not be two years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will you know look this is I go home and I'm like you know what I I really\nWish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut when I get home\nThat's the thing they exist or you know deciding to just eat half of wheel of breed that's fun right now\nAnd when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when you're dealing with long term projections in the economy does that sound will to fancy I like to debris debris delicious your is fantastic uh I also like American cheese on America Jews I'm a burger yesterday was\nDelicious [noise] ah [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that I have to think strategically about is you want to deal with your immediate needs answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know [noise]\nUh that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action or just means we need to be aware that\nThe action is not going to come quickly and we should balance out what are what what what risks are acceptable what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy for children and grandchildren's economies are and then you Gary calling with tariffs on China I I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given up a lot of credit on the turf issue\nAnd um I've been willing to say that I ...

going crazy here\nAnd that's the process that I went through when I started breaking down the matrix I started asking myself am I crazy is this notion is that I'm bringing out from Iraq consciousness really lining up and then what happens is I come across book after book after book that's basically saying the exact same thing in a very different language\nUm but we're putting it all in modern terms and\nIt's amazing I never would've thought that we would be breaking these levels of consciousness or that we would even be waking up to the holographic nature of reality but when science is backing it up ancient books are backing it up\nA now we have these means that are floating around and\nYou know these and PC mean sure they're being targeted to the left but it's rooted in some kind of truth I mean it comes from somewhere and that's the reason why it spreads so so so heavily and the programming is breaking the the uh the matrix is breaking and if I can get one more example of how the matrix is breaking\nAnd the glitches um we have all of these Mandela affects where people legitimately believe that loop I Am your father existed in Star Wars I remember Lou crime your father mirror mirror on the wall um in Snow White doesn't exist in this timeline people look at it from timeline ships and so on and so forth\nI Would say that it's updates coming from this artificial intelligence within the matrix that's hitting our brains and the uptake simply are not sticking anymore and so you have a big portion of the population that remembers ... things the way they were before the matrix was updated\nWell at the same time you had the MPs sees that are being updated almost on a daily basis especially through\nThe data way states that they put themselves in when they're glued to the television are glued to the phone I mean it's getting so bad that they have baby bottles that you put your phone and so you don't have to look at your baby while you're feeding it you can just sit there and be in that data wave state while you're while\nYou're feeding your baby so um it's it's splitting the Vail has split you split right down the middle and consciousness is it's as bad as being revealed for what it is organic and non player character\nI Want to recommend a book and it's a book that if you were paying attention is in the matrix in fact that the book where I remember those guys come to the door the one girl had rabbits tattooed on her arm and he's looking for I think ...\nSchooling or some sort of drug and eat and a meal has hidden in the book in his book ... the the drug and the book is called ... similarly grants simulation it's a book by John ... yard\nAnd basically he's talking about this he said you know their relationships between reality symbols numbers\nOr how society looks at them and how they're used as ... and the thing that the ... and symbolism of cultures and media and constructing\nAnd understanding a shared existence that's what the book is about as a matter of how they try to create a shared existence in the collective there are programs that no the words the numbers the codes and if you can crack the codes and get the cheat sheet you'll be able to master a B the master of the game not be someone who's just at NBC\nUh have power and they certainly blow your mind when you see and you know of course Sandy Hook within
