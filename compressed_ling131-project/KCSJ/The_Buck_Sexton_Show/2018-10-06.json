protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters are really strange church of protesters and I think these lost\nBoys and mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking\nAt emotions and it really is frustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture and she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots\nWhere where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nAre you how do you have in our will make I mean how do you find out how to do on that cap\nI Will be I Will be voting yes\nOn per se hit the final confirmation vote and I will announce my intention signed to how to vote later today than they\nDo Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight who just some magical day and again I go\nBack to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes the salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind you need to put down the pipe\nBut no that's exactly how this worked out Susan\nCollins gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she give a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady get fined for more than Thirty years why can only hope that the cabin uh I'm In age and it's where the press has finally hit rock bottom\nAgainst this backdrop sat each intervention well senator side what the constitution said price\nConsent to ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said\nThat he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them\nSo uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan ... did today in your argument that she made her case\nWas to talk about something that the left would not let us get through\nAnd that was the presumption of innocence\nThat if you were charged with something you've used of doing something in this country we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrint some venison since relevant to the fight consent function when any accusation kept her\nFrom a nominee otherwise think sensory rat I worry that part of this recession could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with the huge damage\nTo the confirmation process\nLiving for over some\nOf the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrate why it hurts that innocence is selling for it\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations framed by professor for but if the allegations that plenty what teenager jets cabinet ... whole girls\nAnd use their we can stay ... gang rape\nYou know what's the most amazing here is it when you think about it\nThe apple collect the behavior of Democrats ultimately helped confirmed judge Kavanaugh and most importantly the absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he\nThe guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that we're debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a ... may have driven Susan Collins to make this choice\nShe talked about this this wild delegation\nFish out last ditch alec gauge what's put forth without any credit supporting\nEvidence and\nSimply parish public statements stepfather\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well reasoned well crafted\nAnd cogent argument for judge Kavanaugh by saying that what was brought up about him was totally totally without any credible evidence and certainly not even a preponderance of the evidence what a brilliant day\nIf he got a thought about that about Susan ... thought about cabinet all you've thought about anything it's friday it's freestyle friday
