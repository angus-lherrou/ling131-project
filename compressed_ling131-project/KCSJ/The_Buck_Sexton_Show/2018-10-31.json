white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the type of rain than vital climate that we find ourselves answer\nPresence opposite racist things obviously demagogue condos and if I'm ... stokes of national it said this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person and what they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to change any of our tactics\nDo not try to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail\nWhy would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to any of this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really\nA ... you know state\nPaid for health care and state paid for college which means you pay for the question of how much it who\nAnd then let the mayhem of the bureaucracy ah get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but you're not even hearing them make a real picture about any of this\n... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election war they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans on the show terrible on a show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that\nThey're actually making the case 'cause there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high five to all of you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class\nHad no idea what's happening until basically had added already occurred on election day\nRight so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not but you're obviously not going to change your mind based on\nWhat they said no matter what no matter what right I mean 'cause you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election a few days right we're we're a week away\nFrom finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years I'm not I'm not the most important election of our lifetime that it's not true okay that'd be ... stop what that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election would probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty six feet\nSo twenty twenty will probably be the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or that the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this mid term shakes out and that's why I just think it's so noticeable the Democrats aren't even\nAt the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe Manchin affect\nHow is Joe Manchin even a Democrat 'cause he likes unions\nI you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left or people that are pretending to be\nA more centrist then they will vote to sexually fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that the more common tactic that's much more likely to be a what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about\nHow protecting protecting preexisting conditions on Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout from a left his trumpet Trump is a racist these terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop so\nThat's why whenever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would if only trouble one what stopped being Trump's and you'll like him this is nonsense waste are based on a mentioned twenty twenty and how do the second most important election of of my lifetime or I liked the trumpet it say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show a place that\nSo far I like 'em all\nI don't see anybody not and should they shut down and I I like to send me very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth is nobody right now that

there was nobody that's even close I the only one who you think maybe is enough of a wild card that it'll be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the\nMore

radio all your favorite music all your favorite stations like us all three of my heart radio try at you like it on your smart speaker new stock by Ninety KCBS Jay and I heard media\nSarah are you this is a this is a part of the discussion that I think always somehow gets or other pushed aside because the politics or maybe there's just some some on his confusion on the part of those who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic but we always hear that it's the proceeds prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're\nTelling me ... it's it's really that these are similar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained illegally and being made illegally so ...\nIs is that an accurate reader of what's going on here it is it is being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out Pfizer has ... from the picture and or any drug company entirely from his\nParents who are we so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a debt tool\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids on we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with both with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started sky rocketing\nBut what what happened was as soon as those\nIssues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in doctors stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this we can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels\nBut China China is also a cooperative this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own till they're owned pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da\n... that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA ... look these pills are almost identical you look at it as an ex it looks like a Xanax that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but\nIt's not it's not a real ... it's not a real purpose that it's not a real actually caught either way taking those for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive it ends to lives lost\nBut when you see it come talented with enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure about you you hear about this all the time but sat in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose and die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example in April this year in Nebraska state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds of that and all\nAnd authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcased\nAre ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcase did in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcased it they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close off this theater right now and they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives\nRealizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids\nWe have to let them know what's out on the streets we have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happen\nBefore we lose a generation of our kids and we have to face it and we have to be honest about it [noise]\nService this documentary tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying\nFrom this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country ah when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people that have been affected by this in any respect because it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly no a greater awareness of it than ever before what what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in\nAn all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child\nAs a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing goes right away so we can save lives and as people we have to realize we have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right\nResources appropriate at the right way so that when the federal government put money\nAside for this epidemic\nThat there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the vast array of our of our\nOf our money pet but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that as this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and how they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in vain V. E. I. N.\nNo I didn't gain the drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and lose their contraband into the United states and that and you are people's gains and into our children's game and we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nOrganization they are pumping and chemicals that could potentially endanger the lives of millions of people and we have to start treating it that way whether that's putting up the wall building the wall or enforcing laws\nOn international live and going after some of these drug dealers that's what we have to do more importantly educating ourselves and educating our children I Can't tell you but how many parents I Know\nThat have no idea that this is actually going on on the streets they have no idea that these pills are manufactured in trailers that that our kids are purchasing step that the drug cartels are making look like pharmaceutical or prescriptions\nA that what our children are doing really understand that it starts at home that it starts at home and now we've got to tackle the bigger broader problem of holding people accountable\nLike the drug cartels in Mexico like you know lower elementary 'til all these different cartel the Beltran Leyva at really making sure that the Mexican government understand that we're no longer playing games\nThat the the left has whenever they're running for office or their somebody in public life you know their public persona\nIs wind is something get treated as a joke versus when is it treated\nSeriously and and when it's done when given the benefit of the doubt\nBy the media you know the narrative the conversation that people have based on what they're reading what they're being told what they're hearing when's that benefit the doubt given to somebody versus when are they to be made an example of which is the obviously the opposite of the opposite effect of all that\nAnd the truth is it's a\nIt's still very much the case that lives pretty much across the board get the benefit of the doubt and then some and conservatives just get crushed and I find that frustrating and\nThis this reminds me of a Lindsey Graham is saying well the only way to get lifted\nChange is to\nDrive them from their villages and here the limitations of their women so to speak ah here's what he here's what Lindsey says about this liquid to\nThe American people have had it with this I've had with it\nKavanaugh the caravan blaming Trump for everything under the sides if you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they got it wrong\nThen vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party the only way they're gonna changes for them to lose the ... the main anything and if you don't want any more Kavanaugh carrier assassinations are\nThen you need to reject what they did and hand them that the state they deserve they want power so badly the media is and the tank for them and the only way they'll get it as for the American thankful to send a loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their tax they've had outlining every Republican for everything\nI think this is an essential element of the Trump movement\nIt really is it really is a strategy winning and winning and winning really is a political strategy and I noticed that sounds ridiculous because it has not always the strategy no in fact Republicans for a long time we're happy to lose as long as they last like gentleman\nBut that obviously didn't get the left to act more gentle mentally it just got the left who say oh great we're winning\nScrew the other guys Trump comes in and says okay it's not going to be perfect is not going to be pretty but if we want them to change we've gotta when\nLindsey Graham is saying that you and you know what Lindsey Graham two point oh is correct

usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative well Maria they are already out\nSpinning a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have or as a and full throated a fashion that they have in the past I think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows enough to know that right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where a gun rights are very much a supported by folks who vote\nAnd so they don't want to create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think your honestly not seeing more shrill ah anti
