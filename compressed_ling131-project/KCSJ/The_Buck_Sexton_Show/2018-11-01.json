that's right there are people beyond this there are people who are involved in organizing and funding and and pushing this whole thing forward oh literally and figuratively\nUm and it would have I been saying all along that there's this talking points\nAre there are thousands of miles away and now they're dying hundred and Ninety nine miles away you know\nThis was ridiculous because\nWhat we're

it's political theater it's political theater well in the military is not going to engage in a military sense the military just as they would be used you know when we send National Guard or will when

the full backing in support of the federal government which by the way of knowing that not happen to the Obama administration did not have under the Bush administration\nThe Bush years are bad on the border\nYou heard it here if you've never heard of before you probably heard me say so but the bushes were battling border issues when George W was he was he was really a McCain conservative in many ways I mean he was a squishy\nOn on some of these very weak on border issues and an immigration issues but we just didn't pay much attention to it because we you know have the really existential fight against radical Islamic terrorism going on [noise] um but I I think that the president is from a purely political perspective\nMaking the right choices here to show the difference what is the difference when it comes to immigration between\nThe Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats don't want to fix anything they want to legalize more and more people that don't want the laws to be

that\nThey want as many unskilled\nA limited education non English speaking workers as possible or even non workers what's going on over there was maybe it was possible as quickly as possible because

I'm Down to it I'm all funny on ... and then\nOh well now let me lecture you all on the constitution in my course see I I'm I'm poor impression voice it's like no\nIf you want to engage in political issues you have to be willing to when you have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have I just have fake puppets calling into my show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest\nAnd Stuart's done lots of that you know shows all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them and if it's a a liberal it's all a joke joke the rights so dumb ha ha\nAnd that was what he did I mean he really just ... what you already have in mainstream media a step further the mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you read the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when\nThat's the whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there is reporting all others reporting and you know breaking news and all this\nBut the live ID it always\nComes out on top and that's the last what those\nOutlets to to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is is winning\nBut the way that the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your idea they say this is just reality this is just the truth and that's why I say that CNN for example launder Z liberalism through a false prism of neutrality\nAnd that's the secret sauce behind what the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal we're just we're just the facts man CNN's apple and banana slogan no that's nonsense\nThey should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead they're liars they're liars tapper liar\nBlitzer wired I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis\nCooper all or at all I mean Don Lemon is like a whole other that's a whole other level but\nYou know he's right about the stewards right about the narcissism point\nAnd it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think that Stewart has come upon some bit of brilliance ear yeah the narcissism is what the narcissism is what the Trump taps into of cars look he understands\nPeople with big egos Trump is a very very big ego we I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very typical guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that we will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your life on ice all of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that\nBecause even if something else is kinda like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believed could happen so I think the guy is kind of earn the right to have a bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for\nEveryone to remember and then you know\nBe humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a for Trump but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever that there's nothing that they can come up with as an answer because it's so once you get older you go oh yeah that's right\nWhy is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta wires every\nA criticism of CNN by the president of a threat to our democracy\nBecause these people have really over inflated senses of their importance let me tell you this and you know you hear this from me all the time I Am lucky to be in this business and I'm Better at this then\nFast majority of people who are in the business and I don't say that to be a modest and just being object and being honest with you know very few people can carry a three hour a day scripted unscripted rather radio show very very few people can really do that um but that's not to say that I also don't ... I Am lucky\nI Am lucky to be able to do this for a living I'm lucky that this is my job this is my job is just my calling my career because of all of you who listen to the show\nYou are the reason that I can do this and it's only through my service my constant effort to meet the expectations and the information or entertainment\nOr needs of this wonderful audience all of you listening that I'm able to do this but I I have no expectation that oh you know I'm American\nBooks Sexton or else of course not right that that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense\nBut do you see that a lot of these other big journal ties that that some of these big oh if they really think oh my gosh without us talk of the republic time probably be better off that the real for that is one when Trump calls him out that's when they get so upset because again they probably would be a you know easier without some of these out what's out there\nI think some of them do act in bad faith and do spread misinformation and propaganda and and don't have a good eat those and an artful of honest people and I mean some of the big the biggest players in the space\nBut it's it's such an important thing you should always feel like anyone that you see in in media anyone in journalism especially on the TV side of the things they should feel blessed and lucky and be always exuding a sense of\nThanks and gratitude to the audience that gives them their job and the moment that they lose sight of that you know that that then you turn into one of these overpaid CNN cry babies you know the moment they lose that that then you start getting this mentality you see what you know the the Acosta effect\nOf like oh I'm just I I Want to U.S policy questions but first I Want to ask like what the president hurts my feelings and like let me just to the story about me\nThat that's the ... the Achilles' heel of the media Trump knows it and he keeps going after it and he should and that's why he keeps winning on the radio\nCan't help but feel like this narrative that just came out today oh yeah there were secrets of peanut for Trump they're trying to make some people out there I remember you know what I Know that this was all garbage you know what I Know that there was no Russia collusion that people think there was are\nDelusional and you know and all the rest of it but there are people out there there are people who are still oh I'm On the fence about this I don't really know and it and if they hear\nThat there's a secret subpoenas for Trump they may say wow I guess maybe there is something to that you know I'm actually going to go for the Democrat last minute I I think I'm going to cast my vote if it's a tight election I'm not really sure and you know I I Believe the rhetoric about healthcare and pre existing conditions that all that stuff I'm going to go the Democrats remember how upset\nThey got the media about ... saying that they were reopening Hillary's email investigation whatever that was a couple of weeks before the election remember how just oh my God it was so turtles unfair\nI think that they would feel completely justified in what is essentially a bad faith leak story like this meant to\nCreate the perception that there's more to the Russia collusion narrative than there is\nI I think that that's you know that's something that\nCould very well happen and you know I haven't spoken much about this uh this summer I think those are things that only journalist really care about but I'll just give me the quick in the quick and dirty on it so there was a a guy tied to the gateway\nPundits oh whose name is actually is keeping me right now but he ah what is this guy's name again I'd never heard of him before Jacob wool a twenty year old a twenty year old for right Internet personality who has written for the gateway pundit um he\nAllegedly tried to entice a woman to claim that Mueller and sexually harassed her in the most\nHam fisted\nStupid ridiculous [noise] kinda transparently\nObvious thing imaginable basically was offering women money to live out more\nI was going to get a report on the allegations are what I don't think he understood is that of all the people that you would kind of mess with right now if you you know that's I don't care who you are fake sexual assault or fake sexual harassment allegations are despicable I don't care who we are talking about\nWe don't lie about people we get them on what they did or you know what they are guilty of we never should get people anyone any\nYou know somebody levels fake sexual harassment allegations against Hillary why\nI wouldn't want that that's not okay I wouldn't be okay with that right we can get around all the other crimes she's committed but you don't ever put fake stuff out there but this gateway pointed guy or he writes for the gateway pundit he looks like he tried to entice somebody to lie about Mueller and that is not a bear that I Would poke let me tell you\nA for all the nonsense about Russia collusion how it's going nowhere\nMowers of federal prosecutors ... a lot of power I Will not mess with [noise]\n\nThe news radio I'm Brian should President Trump is
