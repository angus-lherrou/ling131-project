we can take it up and the stuff about Christians that they do is particularly a nasty you know that's really it's not meant to be laughing with its laughing at all the time\nBut liberals don't have a

colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military\nAnalysts group and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing\nThat us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly approaching the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion air for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that\nWe've tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe powerful renewal of a twenty two new start and you know President Trump said I'm ... weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of mosques\nOh because it it should concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons uh and\n... to Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates\nHow China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states\nYou know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Would ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders and Peter the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAs you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponized everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard\nAnd there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you know for taking time over the top\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis errors Jimi Hendrix taking us into the break with Bhutto child on the coast to coast and\n\nGuy\nOff the coast to coast side he got\nLine we're close to coast am\nNews radio
