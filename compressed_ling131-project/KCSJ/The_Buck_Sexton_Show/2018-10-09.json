{"month": "10", "state": "CO", "station": "KCSJ", "content": "\n[noise]\nYeah [noise]\nI'm mid term coming up at all I don't see those kinds of extreme form I mean I don't sleep sleeping I Love the show [laughter]\nSorry [laughter]\nI'm\nIndian blood in me [laughter]\nAnd then there's where my mother my I just you know we all I see you know I live I watch them hey maybe\nIsn't are ridiculous books I mean the left wants to lecture us about Trump and his decorum and his tweets and I'm hearing more and more from our swamp sources that they're the plan really is as much as I'm hoping\nIt's Hillary make\nAs much as I'm hoping it's Hillary the plan is going to be Warren for twenty twenty maybe Warren and then a a a veep ticket of either a Kamala Harris or maybe maybe Booker\nBut they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody\nWho is entirely unremarkable in her career weren't not for racial fraud racial fraud you know if you will lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison and if you lie about that\nYou get into a whole lot of trouble if you lie about your race in order to\nGet into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious university really at Harvard Democrats as long as you told the line for them or are willing to excuse\nThe whole thing I mean it it should it Jim it's embarrassing and there's a middle is with Warren has now here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things but here's\nWhat I won't let go she has never owned up to this she has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with the racial spoil system\nI did this knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this was ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough that technically I caught technically a qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high cheekbones thing and then we're supposed to pretend that somebody went to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school at Rutgers may become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle\nI didn't let you have something to help you through and she'd never been forced to own up to this and the fact that the less I mean this is just like the NFL meal and\nSay you know Trump is incredible at picking means areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up and energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winner for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the left thought oh and and these different players who obviously or kneeling are but the media narrative around this was over the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this ... you know you guys better stand shoulder because Trump understands that the end of the day\nA vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown flak Moore show them that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas he knows that the left\nIs going to drop it oh my gosh she's being a racist it why Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which\nWas by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there\nUh I was very ... and I'm somebody who really like the early Disney movies about era you know Lion King I beauty and the beach to a great movie\nThe original or will he gets on radio but the old school Robin Hood where he's a Fox so great it's a great cartoon if your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's\nA the cartoons are making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he called Warren Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised the jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just normal people who are not emotionally destabilize left is where we hear is\nWhy are they why are they defending\nElizabeth Warren being called ... where you know she's not a Native American right we all understand is so why do they act like this is some big slide against Native Americans the point is she's a fake she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Pocahontas was probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm\nSure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nBy the ear record nation and how was that matriarchal society you know they were the basis for U.S Constitution\nAnd who there's some really interesting were vision is out there about\nA native peoples in America and how bad technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not mastered the wheel or writing it is tough to claim I think that the European columnist we're taking much of\nTheir political system more you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the Warren thing are we going or Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on in the show\nThe left deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed if they were taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked in ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on these in these positions on these areas because satire is a very powerful\nTool it's very powerful a there's a reason why we still know the names of people like Samuel Clemens Mark Twain why we know the names like ...\nBecause of their ... it was there to cure a cold powers right in in their writing that were show timeless and and really resonated with people\nAnd you you must be willing satirized people like was worn must be going to point out the hypocrisy to the left has here\nAre like and that that she's even being considered that she's being talked about by any one of the possible\nTwenty twenty contender is just mind blowing [noise]\nYour windows are hard to open and close our draftee or difficult\nThe auto then it's time to call renewal

J.\nBut it's not getting your way traumatized as you if not having your politics reflected back to you constantly from the ... the United states is something that you have emotional difficulty dealing with\nIsn't it fair to say that you're not very emotionally well adjusted he's in it straight forward then to just point out that ... you got some growing up to do and you got some ... you got some ... as the kids would say to work through\n'em so I just wanted to know the core Ocasio Cortez who was a darling of the left now\nRefers to leftists in her district as people who are having a psychological breakdown because of Trump\nI I'm not reaching what I point that out I'm not just basing it on their behavior and trying to mock them all that's fun to hash tag owned the lives it's also the case that they recognize that this is really that left ism is now a psychological disorder in the era of Trump\nUh but that wasn't even the ... the silliest or or weirdest things you said I got to tell you\nI've always there are some viral Internet clips uh that that are out there that you just never forget right there's the O'Reilly you know we'll do it live you know we'll do it live I mean you know and you can say that to somebody and they knew exactly you can say those words will do it live and everybody knows exactly\nWe're talking about I mean that clip is it's timeless truly great uh there's also the maps like such as the Iraq and the south Africa like such as that\nYoung woman you know very beautiful young woman and sprayed oh in a in a bad as the Miss America pageant a thinker and his team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and an ... using the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm excusing\nWhatever um but I Know I caught myself but Ocasio Cortez had a moment\nThat reminds me of that I just wanted to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left\nAnd here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is going to be delicious play clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider in a moment watching people like for watching what happened today and want to storm the gates and you're going to actually do that was a well that's what's what's your plan [laughter] well\nI think a lot of changing our strategy around without you know there's a lot of baseball and its inside the beltway as you say that turn out that\nThere are very ... organizers little Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy and what it is really about Oregon I vote\n[laughter] at work organizing restricts all they can learn we bring together a coastal strategy\nPressure on the shoulders of only focus on the shirt but she was really interesting thoughts [laughter]\nJohn did you that's really interesting I Love crusade you jumped into your ... or something [laughter] what are your router that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook for that quip because she was like thank you very much ms Tennessee likes to lead to do this like deep voice announcer man big after like such as Matt\nOcasio Cortez I mean that was\nJohn can you jump to the middle of that again just where she started talking about organizing can you do that because I I don't wanna hear the whole thing you did I just want to hear the oh\nOkay well close enough yeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organize and like outside the box and\nYou know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational I Am there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter] she was I mean John I'm not being unfair right and that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television\nI think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to a point at various dude analysis I mean she she comes out and you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to borrow from the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just a way of doing\nYou know agitation at public agitation in pursuit of personal political uh goals\nRight it's not just whipping people up into in ... style mob there's something more to it than that\nBut then she just gets lost and she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really\nThis learn the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchy the patriarchy and victim allergy and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo\nAnd these phrases that come with it and she's looking for ... you know she's looking to lock into that but she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what she's saying\nYou know this is like when Al Al Sharpton do this resists we much like the resist you know you realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang Ocasio Cortez had us uh R. E. S.\nHe I see gee we should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C. T. that was one of my favorites uh anyway\nYeah ... record says this is the the great\nThe great hope of progressive in this election is that she's a part of a crop of new insurgent left wing candidates who are pushing for\nA ... openly advocating for socialism kiss you define socialism no but like she has an economics degree or because you define Marxism know\nCould you tell you much about marks or angles no\nBut she sounds right to the left and if you sound right and come from the rights group right the right identity group they give you a tremendous amount of difference and that's what you see happening here\nUh I I Would just note that my fear\nAnd I I Know I'm On this and I'm now I'm going to be banging the warning drawing this way in advance and you're like bar come on comedy is great unbelievable jobs numbers everything's going so well and I agree and that's causing from because of the Republicans that are in charge now and it's I think it's gonna keep going for a while here is what I'm telling you though\nRight now we can mock the socialist and these leftist in the Democratic party because\nSound foolish and we know their ideas are foolish and people are in a frame of mind or they will resume through it and understand you know anybody who is paying attention to knows anything you know are not limousine liberals and for people ... people for whom politics is really just an emotional game and it's all about virtue signaling\nThey just want to talk about how they're\nYou know ... Marxist and redistributing wealth and everything 'cause it makes them feel good about themselves they don't think of the economic consequences\nMy concern\nIs that we are going to have a structural economic reset because of the debt and because of the accumulation particularly of corporate debt load and you see that with all these these high you'll bonds that are ... and the corporate debt structures for some of these companies are never going to be able to actually make good on their obligations\nRising interest rates any massive\nYou know he didn't have to do any does he was a billionaire he doesn't have to do any this I I Do think that bears reminding sometimes\nOr whether we should at least take a moment step back and say you know he didn't he's not the Clintons he didn't do this to become rich she was already rich you're doing this because this is what he thinks needs to happen for the country and this is real he is in fact doing public service although he's not the kind of guy who refers to as such\nBut each show important that there's somebody now who will mock and ridiculed the left\nBecause there is a certain\nBreed of conservative something you might even be thinking about you know some names that come to mind but there's a certain type of conservative that finds\nMocking the last to be beneath\nWe should get knocked all the time we should be called you know racist inbred hillbilly beer drinking NASCAR drivers you know because we are concerned right and and so they paint with a really broad brush and they just make fun of us you know we're all a bunch of Bible thumping races\nYou know middle aged white males that the Republican Party the left and they just hammer that culturally all the time and we're just supposed to take it you know the old conservatism they're kind of Weekly Standard conservatism that was dominant in our media discourse for a long time\nThat's faded away now it's no no you're gonna make fun of us we're going to make fun of you know you're going there they made fun of Bush and said his eyes were too close together and he could use a Monica ones that have classes and he's an emphasis on all this stuff they did that for years and years\nPushing ever really hit back nobody in the UP really hit back McCain didn't really hit back Ronnie didn't really hit back\nWe actually need somebody who when ... when we see what the opposition is willing to do will will fight fire with fire these people are clowns polo seat and Booker and Feinstein and\nBlumenthal and just go to these people are jokers\nOnly it's not funny because they're really doing harm to the country and they're willing to destroy people into very\nDishonest things in the process you know and they're delusional\nThey deserve to be mocked they need to be ridiculed they want to step in public life not just conservatives that need to sit there and take it and deal with this any more and that's this is important my friends okay [noise] ridiculing what should be ridiculed in the progressive left\nIs not just a little sweetener that Trump throws in their free speech is we need more of this we medium to own the lives\n[noise]\nSay there's radio I'm Brian shook President Trump is saying he's sorry to justice Kavanaugh following a grueling confirmation process tonight the president honored Brett Kavanaugh at a White House ceremony he said Kevin ... and his family have been put through terrible pain and suffering Kevin faced accusations of sexual assault during his confirmation process\nFlorida governor Rick Scott is urging people in his state to take the threat of hurricane Michael seriously hurricane\nMichael is a massive storm that could bring total devastation parts of our state especially in the pan handle\nThe hurricane is strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico and is expected to make landfall along the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday the national Transportation Safety board is trying to figure out what could have caused the crash in upstate New York they kill twenty people\nState police major Robert pat not confirming the driver didn't have the proper license and the vehicle had failed inspection\nThat company and that vehicle have been under scrutiny of the ... in the past\nGiven the number of seats the vehicle was considered a bus not a little Saturday afternoon was misty and officials note that could explain the lack of skid marks also not clear if speeding was a factor NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt will be investigating all week engines in\nPart to push back into the front of the car certainly indications of high energy in fact\nIt's the deadliest accident in the country since two thousand nine Eighteen occupants and to pedestrians dead James ...
