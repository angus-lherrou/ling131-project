lives with their heads under the hood and that's the way they like it now let's go under the hood with a nordstroms motor medics welcome back to the end of the who'd show we're glad to have you with us eight six six five nine for for ...\nFive oh if you are where a police officer and you came upon a car that was wrapped around a tree you'd be very nervous yes this story does have a good ending okay but uh in may recently\nThe police in Nevada phone a total doubt McLaren seven twenty s near lake meat that would make me nervous did I Would a room it was going to a hundred miles they seven hundred and ten horse power\nTwin turbo charged V. eight car that weighs less than thirty two hundred pounds so we're talking about a a car they can get some sort of sixty in less than three something quick very quick\nWell they ran across this car and they looked up the car and they say the car was purchased just before the friday before it's a a dealership in washing your were Washington DC\nOh and they found it the next day in the great falls area\nSo they're kind of concerned\nAnd so the police department they go out and they put out a message on Twitter saying buying a high performance car which costs about three hundred thousand dollars was total and winding road by on friday total on Saturday the moral of the story that was was printed here or in the final assembly and a lot of automotive news was that\nEven a a hyper super car that has the best suspension and the best breaks and the best of everything for driving fast through a winding road with a\nProperly trained driver right that respects the car\nCan lead to ... near deadly circumstances and if I should do this picture the driver was minor league injured oh my but that's what they ran across I Can't show our listeners that pitcher but I can show Russian Christ that picture out ... you would you would expect to come upon that vehicle and find\nRight someone not with us any All right and I know from experience that if you get a car that you think you'd understand and do something you aren't trained to do\nIt can go bad in a hurry I've had that happened in my life for a couple of different time usually cars\nThat stick really hard and performed really well around those corner when they break loose when they break loose hang on much worse than a regular\nCars sold on this is just a good reminder slow down\nIt could cost the especially if you're driving your new McLaren ... seven twenty s not a good not a good thing not a good thing at all\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's the call came in after hours\nGuys out here in the back door of two thousand viewing this or does it work\nFor those warm air into the ... part not the cross propose warm there\nOnce the engine gets up to operating conditioned about a hundred and eighty three hundred and eighty five degrees no matter where he just said it starts flowing cold here and the idea is that is\nSo it's fine warming up so it has heat when it until warms up yeah the bad thing about that is a lot of cars that have had gas\nTheir shoes that start blowing exhaust gases into the cooling system when it's fully warmed up interrupting the cooler full they\nAct like that as they start up and they're starting to warm up oh great cooler warm air warm or hotter now the temp you know when it's colder and it'll switch back and forth as you drive down the road and accelerate the celery that's one of the that's a possibility\nThe only other thing you could be is the complete failure of one of the fresh air vents are where it would be ducking right past year corps fresh outside here right or\nElectronic temp sensor in the car that once it warms up since ... and it changes I mean those are a couple of things we would be leaning towards doing a head\nGasket check on a vehicle like that it's the ... with a with a gas tests or how do you do that whether it's a pretty simple primary under kept comes off when you're mature there's no pressure do don't blow it off this is somewhat shop needs to do what they were to remove the cap they would use is or the or a full bottle whatever your applause\nDraws gases from the radiator just there are no who went through this two filled with liquid a couple of separate compartments and as it goes through if there's hydrocarbons which has anything that's in your\nTailpipe coming out in that cool which there should be none of it indicates there's the crack a block or a or a gas leak immediately turns callers from usually from blue to yellow when you\nGot a problem was that doesn't occur there is a good indication that it's something else but that's a quick cheap test to find out what's going on\nOur head gas gets better these days or has my life changed as I've become an adult\nYeah and well you here's part of it though they've started going to similar mated metals between the head the block okay a lot of her head gasket problems came in when we had aluminum cylinder it's sitting on top of a cast iron blocks\nAnd so you had different properties of heating different properties of the of the ability to to flex under heat\nAnd marrying the too doesn't always work great but when I was in high school a ten year old car was a Nineteen eighty car so they were more likely to be well and and even before that you had cast iron on top of caster ... which wasn't as much of a problem\nBut when they started getting in the middle ground or they had a looming them on top of castor that's when we started seeing more oh yeah more more problems with that gas gets in an intake gas gets now as we've advanced\nWe ever got aluminum blocks aluminum heads and also you are in some situations not pushing 'em the pressure or through the system that you were on the other ones but I think the bigger issue would probably be the fact that the cool with properties have gotten better\nUh I think people are more\nIn tune with coolant maintenance than they probably were ten years ago\nI think the court maintenance used to be looked upon in a similar fashion as Greek fluids maintenance maintenance is today replace it when there's a lead exactly yeah and they didn't realize the ability for that coolant\nTo build up alkaline properties and metallic properties just based on its use through the vehicle\nAnd and those are the things over time if it's not replaced in that\nThat cool and gets whether it be too acidic or to have you in one property other it'll start\nShe ... away at the gas gets and eventually causes the cause of the week and so I think that the combination of some of those things have changed so we don't see those those normal offenders like we usually would still seeing a lot of it out there\nThanks for joining us on the under the

just say it's an hour forty two in\nInsulation is maybe in our three per inch of sickness you can do some quick math and I figure it's going to be around sixteen inches of insulation somewhere in that area and if you get up there and you're measuring you've got five inches of insulation you you know you got your work cut out for\nYou so can you put insulation on top of insulation for the most part yes the only way you wouldn't want to do is if you had a vapor barrier that was a on top of the insulation which I Hope you don't have\nUsually a vapor barriers facing down towards the living area of the house and let's say five six inches you know you got to add another ten twelve inches on top of that and you can put batting down on your face batting\nOr you get below insulation in and you could blow a cellulose insulation and you could blow fiberglass insulation you don't want to cover up to solve advance if he had old wiring up there you don't want to cover that up in fact you shouldn't insulate over at all ever never\nYou have over a candlelight you want to make sure that they're protected you don't want to do this\nIt over them but for the most part not a difficult job\nIf you want to lay bats over that's fine bats are not quite know the you know they're still gonna be a gap between the would up in the addict that the ... the presses there's going to be a little scene there where's your blowing it and it's kind of film and all that area\nBut just adding insulation real good idea and get it up to speed the LA Times your department of energy will tell you okay for new constructions are this is remodeled should be our this but you know somewhere in between if you're just sitting up there for five inches of insulation you you got some work to do\nAnd also when you get up there just kind of take a look it's crazy what you're finding your attic fine mold on the underside of the roof maybe some rotted would maybe you've gotta moisture issue\nMaybe there's dead birds in there maybe there was some critters that we're living in there and the nest was made in the insulation\nSo that's telling you you got a problem you've got to breach somewhere in the middle of that house it needs to be repaired\nAnd maybe that old insulation needs to be removed at that point\nBut a lot of times it's outside it's Adam mind\nAnd that's not always a good option so when it comes as we said just start keeping the cold air out that's a real good place to start is the ad against elation and just get up there and take a look and see what's going if you're not capable of getting up to get somebody to get up there and take a look at it or do an energy audit\nAnd address those issues eight hundred ... two three eight to five five that's our number Mike welcome\nSir how you doing doing great\nRight now I'm a ... a cabin down in Santa Fe on the Tennessee River uh-huh I've got a guy will too\nBut I kinda like at that rate foam inflation uh-huh have you or your money going to do is to lie for you right while\nAnd the crowd things underneath it it got on the side of a mountain so ... the lord and it won't be jumping up in the addict he wants to pray at the top of the roof ... metal roofing\nOver two by four that are on that yet a Mars Arnold ... over the vertical raptor but then they rolled out some kind of in the late ... now certainly inflation unit hung in group filling in it mhm but I have no way to get that phone stay up and then do the\nDominant very we should just spray the top of the roof okay ... prior to the root\nMhm mhm so there's not going to be any venting in that in that room correcting we're just going to encapsulate that whole ... area correct\nThat lady okay you know and I don't need to do any um property Sony if he does it that way\nThat is correct so what you're talking about is actually pretty trendy my kids started probably Fifteen Years ago yeah you're a trendy guy can tell\n[laughter] older guy\nI'm not going there I'm not going there so uh [laughter] to answer your question yeah about Fifteen\nYears ago a company called ice ... started this process of whole house in ... and ... and it really is it makes an entire insulated Ava low to the house\nFrom the roof all the way down to the side walls it doesn't require softened venting it doesn't require a roofing a roof venting because basically that attic area becomes a conditioned area now so if you had air conditioning or heating that becomes a conditioned area so it's\nKind of all in one in terms of the house very very cost effective very very energy efficient\nVery quiet in that house now the challenge because there's nothing that's ever perfect the challenges that houses really sealed it's really super energy efficient you just gotta be careful

B. C. company if you're dealing from a company has been around a while has a great reputation they're not going to carry junk because they're going to warrant that for a long time\nAnd they're going to be there for you so finding that good technician that's what you want to do\nSo anyway just getting nothing inspecting\nGetting it done or the key and please if you get a carbon monoxide detector in that house\nSmoke alarm in the house you could\nSay that about year round but it's really important in the wintertime if you're not having that furnish checked in the chimney inspected potentially there's things that can go wrong and we'll hear about the news\nHouses get closed up and then this family hadn't a carbon monoxide problem and\nYou know somebody passes away somebody's ... the whole family is very sick you you want to get that taken care of it in one of the things that is interesting over the years I've done different stories and carbon monoxide if you feel like the whole family's got the flu but when the kids go to school they feel fine\nAnd you don't have a carbon monoxide detector they may not have the flu they may have mild carbon monoxide poisoning 'cause that's\nWhat it's like you can smell it you can't see it but the effects of the human body is flu like symptoms interesting yeah\nSo uh I you know this one lady I talked to their family had a criminal oxide problem when the kids went to school and went to an overnight and one of their friends' house\nKids weren't sick lady when she went to work she was sick\nShe got home she'd be watching TV should have a headache just feel lousy wake up the horrible good work feel good\nHuh and what it was the the the pipe that go into the chimney was cloth\nAnd didn't have an inspection and as soon as we're going right into the um so make sure you get a carbon monoxide detector that's very very important\nAh John welcome morning how are you doing good right thing for show you\nA couple of questions here a one a\nRoute a tile floor or the or the town for the ground in the middle or what is the best way to\nIt's it's almost like a [noise] a why is what it used to be I'd like to bring it back to why what is the best way to do that and it's at at the ... oh yeah yeah I mean\nThere's people that do it they'll steam cleaned drought and stuff like that but uh you can use different um like a grand a gold they make a ground stone cleaner it's going to take some scrub and\nCan use a Mr cleans scouring the sponge or that a plane and then the secret is to get that um get that sealed and that's the key getting killed so\nI mean in the path to clean it but it just seemed like the material that I purchased a you know didn't clean it like a [noise]\nMore than you there yes you could always tell that it was wider over there\nWell I'll tell you what I just clean some grout um with some um granted go route cleaner and then I see that with the sealer and we're just talking to my wife and I are just talking about this this morning and it's amazing how it has not come back\nBecause the water ruse cells moisture penetration into that ground so it does that mold John I'll get to the rest of the question off the air we're up against the are up against the clock don't forget\nUh my favorite product got her brushed\nBut tell you what if the leaves have fallen in your house to get the leaves out

[noise]\n... well well hold on you use the wet and forget correct\nYou go to your mind again okay did to get rid of it are no\nGood okay we got a lot of tree okay and in fact the attack\nAnd is it back in the exact same place where it was yeah\nWell that that surprises me a little bit in Maryland because the wedding forget it does do a complete kill and the complete kill should I'm not going to say prevent because that's too big of a word let's say slow down the progression of re growth\nUh so it does leave they I I guess it would leave a little bit of a film nothing that you should be able to see nothing that should be slippery but um since it is a complete kill it should take longer\nFor the ... growth to take place now you say there's a lot of woods and a lot of shade so ... so yeah so let's do this um I think that whole problem is telling us something\nWe can certainly use the wet and forget again and the ... you know it works um in it'll kill it\nBut I think we need to get that brick sealed\nOh I don't think what's going on remember the mold the middle do the algae to fungus the like and all that keen grow unless there's moisture\nSo we've got a shaded area we got a lot of ah um dust that's on that broke we got a lot of a morning dues in ... and he keeps that brick wet\nAnd if that brick isn't waterproof per se it wicks that moisture in in its um it holds that brick or holds that water net brick\nFor a longer period of time so if we get to a mold the bill doing everything off and then we use a brick ceiling\nOr brick waterproof and 'cause you don't really want to seal it you want to allow water from the backside to transfer through it but the rain water you want to keep it from absorbing into the brick and then I think what will have is we'll have that problem pretty much fixed up\nNorth side of the house and it kind of year we ... we hardly ever get any\nSense right right right right and how old is the house\nOr the house forty eight years old okay but get now patio with cutting last fall okay but we did not feel it\nOkay so this is on the patio this was on the floor so that kind of a verbs right\nYeah we had company can now they got it yeah it was a name and what is\nIt yeah you need to get that sealed there's no question about it so you can get out as so we can spray the wedding forget on their if you'd like or if you want something\nUm that's immediate so you can do it you know in a day or two um we could use like a high grade a a missionary cleaner\nIn fact there's a website let me just give you that Marilyn and you can decide which way you want to go okay we know the wedding forget work so but we also know it's going to take four weeks to get it to clean and the time of year we might want to move a little bit faster\nSo it had to do that when I get\n... probably I I don't have the label in front of me\nI had on the label 'cause we read that\nOkay well if it doesn't ever precaution know it can be spread anytime then okay okay but um the the website I Want\nYou to look at is called masonry defender\nNathan Mary defender ray\nAnd what they've got his they've got a main street cleaner\nIt's a high grade oxygen they bleach which I recommend it for years it's you mix it with water you spray it on your weight about ten minutes then you take like a big street broom in your scrub scrub scrub pick your hose rinse it off\nAllow that brick to drive for a day or two and then apply their paver sealer all that there's there there's websites got six products on it [laughter] okay so it was real easy to find an order right on line and are you what the ... cleaner and then the brick paver sealer\nAll right well that's you\nKnow there you're probably make a big difference getting that sealed really will keep that a brick from observing that water it'll make a big difference\nWhere I'm going into winter we got to be cautious everybody comes in the back\nDoor yeah yeah All right thank you so much for your help alright

Ninety five percent of home leaky duct work and another misconception that's out there and then you know you might hear someone say well I have a new ...\nMinute effort can delete well it's just because you put two pieces of anything together and it's prone to having you know points have leakage\nNow you may not know this in fact I Know you don't know this but was Seventeen years old my job was to run Duckworth uh-huh [laughter] and I don't think duck works installed like this anymore because what I used to have to do and I had to do it right that when we put those two foot pieces together\nWe'd have to run little heck said screws\nAnd make sure those duck works were connected I'm not so sure that's done anywhere anymore\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean there's there are and different approaches to the installation of growers and that the setting of the the two PIN and certain states across the country have codes now that require that for me the old when it's installed\nThough when you were saying that Ninety five percent figure of duck works leaky in the United states first thought I had this sounds like we need new duck work at our home so we need newer technology duck works that probably help huh\nIt would then okay Harris he'll help\nYeah well it's going to go there too because well you know you're not going to run a business of Ninety five percent of the homes of leaky a duck work if we changed it you got you got fifty years to get your ghetto that is true All right so um so it's a good bet that every one that's listening\nThey're not getting the efficiency of that foreign as they're not getting that heated there to the places they want so what is zero seal\nThe deal is a technology that's been developed about Twenty years ago and by the department of energy acts really uh-huh yup down at uh UC Berkeley lab mhm\nUm and it when it was developed to help make the duck system more efficient at the best way to put it at the tiny hole and crack and that our our typical into an adopted them mhm and it also at the at the long term\nAnd you know almost permanent type solutions and once you do that technology\nAnd it feels that the network and guaranteed for ten years but it's been a stress test it to last up to forty years filling those cases are as long as you're going to be in your home\nRight right so it's kind of a line or\nWell kind of I I some people\nTo simplify it look at it like kind of like six a flat in a way okay bye\nAnd to be real precise about it it doesn't actually ... the ... when it does is it find the whole okay like you have a balloon pop a hole in it mhm you're gonna have air escaping out of that whole right kind of pressure right right right\nAh our technology is able to find those holes and then he'll I'm from the outside in a negative air pressure exactly that's exactly right but you know kind of stuck\nIn low on the ...\nFeels ... is that right now that okay All right so ah so I had this done to my home and I I don't know when it was but I'm going to say\nThirteen Years ago and and I notice the difference immediately so if a homeowner\nFirst of all you got to find a deal that's installing that I'm assuming that you've got air assault dot com\n... dot com and there is located are there\nAre okay so I called this company up and I say I want you to check my ...\n... and ... our system itself will check to see how leaky the doctor again than we do at before and after type comparison when they hook up the machine and they can run a test\nTo see what they charge you ... you know like a blower door test for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blast protests and better than alerts OK I'm ... different dealers approach it differently and you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways Gary any you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find right have you know I talked to my my mom and my sister about\nIt and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find well one of the easiest of course you mentioned that right when we began to the segment here in it and a lot of people think it's normal\nFor that that far room to be colder than the rest\nOf the how old is normal it's Ninety five percent of ... we keep [laughter] ... right\nTo make sure they have to say\nThe\nBanks of people's American\n\nAt springs so much joy into our lives they're loyal for protective and smart you are the smartest our pets might be they can't advocate for themselves especially in the event of a natural disaster Hi I'm Shaun low\nLast year during Hurricane Harvey I saw the impact of natural disaster first had many family suffered the added heartbreak being separated from the pet that's why it's important your pet is part of your family's disaster preparedness plan like storing pet food medical records and supplies waterproof containers\nAnd keep their favorite comfort toy handy this one or the\nProper identification microchip\nAt a photo of you with your pets can help in case you get separated I Can't imagine what we would do without you really\nIf you take steps now you'll encounter less stress during the chaos of an emergency\nTo learn how to prepare your pet for a natural disaster up your veterinarian and visit ban field foundation dot org slash disaster don't save it for a rainy day\nOf work are getting ... because like if I'm buying a high efficiency foreigners and I got crummy duck\nWork he he you know can he helped me at all\nHe sure can and there are still many different ways to check for evidence of how your ... you know performing how in hell healthier than the cranes ... there are simple tools and things that a lot of contractors Carrie it's called a smoke prefer okay\nYeah all it is it's exactly what it sounds like it's a little too but that will blow the smoke and find air currents\nTo for example if you put your hand up to ... you were talking about that exposed ... right right see smoke coming out on the air shouldn't be anything blowing right right you you turn on that smell pepper ... you see that it's blowing either sucking it in or pushing it out\nThat's not a good thing and that's one yeah I'm In for a red\nOr as I say that's why I asked this question so you don't have to have the big blow tests that I had no you deny you do not so they shoot an infrared camera on a wall mhm and also you got a big old red line going right through the middle you were like what's that all the\n... it's like Superman right behind the wall in the heat and cool and like you\nGot to register behind the wall and that's not helping anybody\nThat's right that's exactly right\nSo in all HVAC guys carry those for the most part\nYeah and more and more these days mhm but as a homeowner I Would ask and I would ask how are you going to help me make sure that the the ... to the Clinton and it's going to work in a way to tell you what are you doing to address my duct work because I Know how important it is a daddy Clinton it\nAnd we also know Ninety five percent of the people have leaky Duckworth that's right so so we already know you're not getting your value when you buy the new economical\nYeah what else carry the a lot of that\nA lot of the equipment manufacturers now in their consumer literature there now including warnings about the importance of it that brick right and they're saying there are things that can do if it or cause I'm Sorry cause the fish and the drain sure sure you ask about your duct work sure\nBecause they got phone calls and said hey this Ninety seven percent furnaces not lowered my eating bill one bit yet that the wire tapping yeah sure you're right\nAll right so if you are buying a furnace and it's getting installed talk about talk to you technician really about a thermal imaging some walls and make sure I don't have the leaky dj because otherwise you're not going to get the value of that I'm highly efficient furnace if you're living in an older home and you got a\nCoup spots throughout the again\nGet a hold of an H ... thermal imaging thing go to ... dot com in a you can find somebody that's a\nSkill to installing this particular thing and you say the ... around the three years yeah on average yeah that that's often so look wrap up give me some benefits of if you're perfect duck working in a nice\nNice uh efficient furnace and I have air sealing the duck\nWe're All right Gary I can do this one in my sleep you're good good I was thinking to myself that might be an unfair question right off the top down now right at kind of fun because there's really there's really no other product in our industry that can do\nAll of the things that that can do and plenty that can be one of our two of the things that when you break it down for every now\nAnd if you're a homeowner who has their own the all done on your duct work and the things are going to notice they're going to be more even temperatures throughout your house none of those hot and cold pot cool\nAnd you're also going to notice a difference and the humidity you're going to be able to better control the humidity in your home so\nYou have a dry home or a superhuman home that should be even doubt that should be a big benefit air quality now this one this is near and dear to my heart and you're going to be breathing the nasty contaminants from the ... faces in the attic or the ...\nIt's being sucked into the leaky Duckworth\nGotten right and then as the the lady of the house I might not have to die as much ... and that's that's a fun one my wife asked me to us by the way then I just want to go on record design of college I\nMean I duster well she doesn't go\nDo a lot less ... less allergens that energy saving he will not at that as well and then uh this one is also I think really important and that is it's going to ... tech and prolong the life of your ha the equipment\nAnd it's going to make sure you you get what you paid for nature

get to a rich welcome\nGarry love your show thank you\nWe have a a theater fence that we put up twelve years ago and when we put it up we stained it and now it's at the point where it needs to be a real pain ... my only question is does\nIt matter what kind of thing we originally put on a twelve years ago\nBoil versus warm now that I'm going to guess that's\nPretty [noise] pretty much a mute point at this point are probably the biggest thing you need to worry about is just ah making sure it's a really clean and that you get the pores of the would kind of opened up um that can be done fairly easily\nI'm using an oxygen native bleach and scrubbing that down rich and then use the wood bright near\nThat really opens up the wood fibers at that point no matter what you use for the use acrylic\nOr whether you use a oil base um it'll get it'll it'll penetrate the the wood deeper which means it's gonna last longer right but uh if you had an oil based on the only time you know there's always\nThere's always a disclaimer right and the only thing I could think of that would require you not to do that\nThere is some products out there in fact one time would is one of the brand names\nAs it is neither in oil base Nora water base it's actually a liquid solid in other words for it doesn't dry it cures by the UV rays of the sun\nUm in you know it's like Ninety dollars a gallon that lasts like seven years it's good stuff but if that was on that fence I Would tell you to stick with it\nUh but if it's just an oil in like a ton moral base or\nEven ... base or or water base at this point I think just getting a noxious ... would break ground there you'll be absolutely fine\nOkay great aunt one other question how do how do I convinced my grandchildren standing offenses fine\nWill that my friend is is I I don't know but I'm all about that first you gotta know how old are they\nAre they're eleven twelve in that area so they're all\nAnd K well maybe money [laughter] they ... they had to start operating like us at that point I didn't go and ...
