way they like it now let's go under the hood with a nordstroms motor medics welcome back to the end of the show are glad to have you with us eight six six five nine\nFor for ... five oh if you ah were a police officer and you came upon a car that was wrapped around a tree you'd be very nervous yes this story does have a good ending okay but uh in may recently\nThe police in Nevada phone a total doubt McLaren seven twenty s near lake meat and that would make me nervous that I Would a room it was going to a hundred miles is the seven hundred and ten horse power\nTwin turbo charged V. eight car that weighs less than thirty two hundred pounds so we're talking about a a car they can get some sort of sixty in less than three something quick very quick\nWell they ran across this car and they looked up the car and they say the car was purchased just before the friday before it's a a dealership in washing your were Washington DC\nOh and they found it the next day and the great falls area\nSo there are kind of concerned\nAnd so the police department they go out and they put out a message on Twitter saying buying a high performance car which costs about three hundred thousand dollars was total and winding road by on friday total on Saturday the moral of the story that was was printed here or in the final assembly and a lot of automotive news was that\nEven a a hyper super car that has the best suspension and the best breaks and the best of\nEverything for driving fast\nThrough a winding road with a properly trained driver right that respects the car\nCan lead to ... near deadly circumstances and if I show you this picture the driver was minor league injured oh my but that's what they ran across I Can't short listeners that pitcher but I can show Russian Chris that picture out ... you would you would expect to come upon that vehicle and find\nRight someone not with us any All right and I know from experience that if you get a car that you think you'd understand and do something you aren't trained to do it can go bad in a hurry I've had that happen in my life for a couple of different times usually cars\nThat stick really hard and performed really well around those corner when they break\nLoose when they break loose hang on much worse than regular cars sold on this is just a good reminder\nSlowdown\nIt could cost the especially if you're driving your new McLaren as seven twenty s not a good not a good thing not a good thing at all\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh here's the call came in after hours\nGuys out here in the back door of two thousand viewing this heat or does or\nDoes warm air into the ... look at the crossroads warm there\nOnce the engine gets up to operating conditioned about a hundred and eighty three hundred and eighty five degrees no matter where the heat is that it starts cooling any ideas on that guy is\nSo it's fine warming up so it has heat\nWhen it's still warms up yeah the bad thing about that is a lot of cars that have head gasket issues that start blowing exhaust gases into the cooling system when it's fully warmed up\nAnd interrupting the cooler full they act like that as they start up and they're starting to warm up oh great cooler warm air warm or hot air now the temp uses up that way of colder and it'll switch back and forth as you drive down the road and accelerate the celery\nThat's one of the that's a possibility\nYou could be is the complete failure of one of the fresh air vents are where it would be ducking right past year corps fresh outside here right or\nElectronic temp sensor in the car that once it warms up as it is it changes I mean those are a couple of things we would be leaning towards doing a head gasket check on a vehicle like that is the ... with the with the gas tests or\nHow do you do that but yeah it's a pretty simple primary under\nKept comes off when you make sure there's no pressure do don't blow it off this is somewhat shop needs to do what they were to remove the cap they would use this for the or a full bottle whenever you apply laws draws gases from the radiator just there are no coup through this two filled with liquid a couple of separate compartments and as it goes through\nIf there's hydrocarbons which is anything that's in your\nTailpipe coming out in that cool which there should be none of it indicates there's they crack a block or a or a gas leak immediately turns colors from usually from blue to yellow when you you\nGot a problem was that doesn't occur there's a good indication that it's something else but that's a quick cheap test to find out what's going on\nOur heads gas gets better these days or has my life changed as I've become an adult\nYeah and well here's part of it though they've started going to similar mated metals between the head the block okay a lot of our head gasket problem scheme in when we had aluminum cylinder it's sitting on top of a cast\nIron blocks and so you had different properties of cheating different properties of the of the ability to to flex under heat\nAnd marrying the too doesn't always work great but when I was in high school a ten year old car was a Nineteen eighty car so they were more likely to be well and and even before that you had cast iron on top of caster ... which wasn't as much of a problem\nBut when they started getting in the middle ground where they had a looming them on top of Kashmir and that's when we started seeing more ... more ... more problems with head gasket in in in the gas gets now as we've advanced\nWe have got aluminum blocks aluminum heads and also you are in some situations not pushing 'em the pressure or through the system that you were on the other ones but I think the bigger issue would probably be the fact that the coolant properties have gotten better\nUh I think people are more\nIn tune with coolant maintenance than they probably were ten years ago\nI think that ... maintenance used to be looked upon in a similar fashion as break fluids maintenance maintenance is today replace it when there's a week exactly yeah and they didn't realize the ability for that coolant to build up\nAlkaline properties and metallic properties just based on its use through the vehicle and and those are the things over time if it's not replaced and that that cool and gets whether it be too acidic or to have you in one property other it'll start\nShe's going away at the gas gets and eventually cause the cause of leak and so I think that the combination of some of those things have changed so we don't see those those normal offenders like we usually would still seeing a lot of it out there\nThanks for joining us on the under the hood show until next time you can find us on line you can find is under

wireless so it's just basically it's a ten or Fifteen minutes a project after you turn off the brick or by the way\nSo good points out you know very good very good so you turn off the breaker literally I made sure we'd go walk up and it was it was no more than ten minutes and I'm you know you have a nice little diagrams you know for the screws need to go out and you just live in

garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the lights and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate which is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire that played up you're not actually holding the light and you're right it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd went that's once that's mounted you take up the light and you just snap it into place and you're good to go\nSouth really has amounted to light the maximus flood light is easier to mail that a flood like you buy the big ... really is because of the

very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when

dinner the one fellow that was with us as well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notified makes a sound or listen\nTo the ad sewage and whatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise what however you set it up and your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to the camera alive\nAnd you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation if you like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar I mean you can do is learn that can be\n... so if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package\nOr maybe they're taken aback each um you can take action\nAbsolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded and sent to the cloud for for downloading viewing later so\nSo if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter] you can see if there's kids coming to the ... usually not every child legs are products\n[laughter] we've heard lots of stories last couple of years is so this coach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you are the only ones that have ... Samaras are are usually cameras free standing or yeah so there's a\nThere'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light\nA application you know we're really the only ones that carry on a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the force that does come and different um different styles indifferent finishes 'cause we trying to accommodate you know the the lights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there\nYou know as a release the porch light we've you know really know competitors the flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe\nIn our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing product with ours and how much happier they are with the product\n[noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera and the quality\nOf the cameras detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera it's a hundred and two hundred and Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but because of our application and our software and the for more on the products we actually use less resources so\nUm we're not as resource um heavy so our products for work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife eye signals not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good um customer satisfaction\nThe app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other animals so I'm really yeah I mean we do some nails or someone that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day and time\nI'm it's just it's again there's so many features and our app that customers really like and we we hear that you know quite often\n[noise] now on the coach light with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle and you talk about the distance but its position of all too\nYeah so it's a it's in a ball basically um both the the lights and the coach later the other a porch lights\nWe put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed the product\nYou want to aim that cameras you get the optimal um field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a lock and rainy and lock that camera and the place and then and typically it just stays there then\n... but when you're watching a when you're watching the um the either the live feed are you watching the video later you can ... you can actually ... so\nYou're able to go in pretty close to a\nTo whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close if you use them in with the pension is great\nGreat so I'm Daniel let's open up the phone lines if someone has a question about the maximus lighting or whether they have um a any questions on on\nOn security and safety around your home they can call our number is eight hundred eight two three eight to five five\nAgain it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five and when we come back marked we can um I like to just kind of what happens when somebody walks up to the home we talked about from a receiver in our home popped there are phone pops up and says somebody's at your door but what's experiencing\nWhat does that person experiencing from that end and it was absolutely nuts will cover next we'll continue your at home with Gary Solomon\nWhen they called a guarantee of had won eight hundred three talk at home with Gary fell on\nThe radio on the Web if I die the case yesterday dot com [noise]\nIf you're\nDealing with metal chances are you're dealing with rust rusty boats rusty parts rusty hinge is built one product bust that rest every time it's P.

health\n[noise]\nAll right\nMark kind of cut here's my guess he is with maximus lighting and we've been talking about the smart security lake by max was how it operates flood lights with cameras coach lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds\nBefore before what before you see right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have ... in a sense and weak in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver or a FedEx or UPS drivers dropping off a package you actually when you watch the video you actually watch the driver walk up to your house and put the box on your porch ring the doorbell and leave you'll see everything\nOr throw it or whatever they do [laughter] or can we take a couple of calls again it's maximus lighting dot com and you can check out what these\nUh super easy

maximus letting sorry in a we'll answer your email right away super\nAll right let's get to the phones and if you have a question about this feel free to jump on board again it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five and Diane welcome\nMhm how can we help me yes\nWell I heard a click the cattle and ... with a camera now what happens is that many perfect like ... or ... is that possible and cover it so they can't do nothing\nOr sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block the share of the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras are very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten seconds buffer though right yeah you because you've got to walk up you got to get to the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there's also when other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know income need or you can actually turn that light off in the app so that little blue light is not on the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so but\nVery good question oh Diane you're thinking\nThere's not a lot that goes off on your phone at how many were actually not a light off the face so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you to care so it is smart importer than we already said how their day to three\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI ah I have a question we shoot the runaround what trick or treaters\n... yes I mean the um you know if you have the porch lights on your front door um I mean it's designed to pick a motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the Arab you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know you look out your window you can see them um\nYou can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard is in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and historic recording that activity\nOr any kind\nOf curious 'cause we are very true life you know our law turned off\nEvery ten minutes without turning around the house\nAnd go running if there's a way to get the sense that\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control ... literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera\nAnd you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera and beyond that you can actually turned into a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so when she saw the product you can kinda tune\nYou know which alert you want to get the ones that matter and that again we've built on that features into the product in the app very cool and\nThen see that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by\nThe questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five she'll a welcome\nHello yes\nI was wondering like how do you have any generators that are run by ... or any solar panels or how Kyle or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so let me well I don't\nI mean I don't know how to share okay well ... actually today\nMarks ready to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line so if the power goes out on your home\nNo matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone and it says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that is off line for some reason which is usually it's a user either the wife dies out okay or the power's out we don't offer um any type of supplemental power this time we get that question it's something that we're learning that\nThink it's crazy but really crazy at my now literally her\nTo catch I and I kept hearing that that might well yeah I\nYou can pick up the podcast angel again we we got that on our website scary solving online dot com but one of the questions I have for you as we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also\nIs and again did they have any video of this happening at all now yeah but I'm the ... and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting that wouldn't be a problem though\nRight we're gonna we're gonna one of the videos is to send him to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we we bolted onto the front of the video so you would get the person coming up to the door\nAnd see them in the video before the damage whites keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture is not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right this is actually it is to a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what's there yeah it looks like a ... coach would know that the camera's there unless you're really looking forward\nTo but if you did you have that extra ten seconds which is awesome unavoidable\nWere catch him don't worry we're going to catch him yeah\nSecond on that answer possibility that the only way we do I mean sure possibly a building that\nOkay we watched the first stole a car and insurance to keep them tying having sort of\nOur vehicles to electric\nWell I mean we can we are re integrated though with a with Google Home an election which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I had at the first time I've heard that question it's a good\nOne that's a great college that one day yeah sure yeah but in the Google it certainly could be up there are sure\nI'm In love at\nGreat thank you very good thanks angel\nAppreciated and again these are available at Costco it's available at home depot got smart listeners I'm telling you what right there and there were actually\nThe promises and other stores to I Know there's not not every storm blows but ... I Believe in five or six hundred stores okay I'll take care of the product to so okay can they order online course yet if you Google the maximus smart security ... light\nYou'll find all the different ... platforms that you can buy the product okay I think I Know the answer to this one Andy welcome\nHey my question was you touched on the lights earlier but our our in the camera I got a ... actually just at the light switch as I'm walking out the door am I going to lose the functionality of the camera\nYeah so you know a lot of the uh your porch lights are on a switch we recommend that you actually a wire around that said that the camera cannot be turned off I mean you get an education at the ... the cameras off line\nBut um we recommend that you actually eliminate the switch so that the powers never uh never turned off and then just programming is on your apt to do whatever you want to get in and you can turn the alerts off too so let's say you're back door and you go in and out of your backdoor all day you can actually go into the app and turn the alerts off\nYou know during the day if you don't want to get those you know while you're home sure but we recommend the optimal way to use the product is just not have the power be able to turned off All right All right\nVery good thank you up by the way we got one line open we got just a few more minutes with mark if you want to grab it real quick it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five eight ... two three eight to five five um we're just going I mean I'm sitting here I Know it I've\nInstalled it um door bill's absolutely yeah so you know the products that we've have in the marketers so just wildly are performing and customers are just you know you're just so impressed with the products and it's really improve the\nThe quality of their lives the convenience of the ... of of having the the cameras and knowing what's going on with their homes we get so many requests about what about inside the house would have been a doorbell\nSo there are other products in the markets a doorbell products become video door bells were releasing our um our doorbell early next year it's going to be called the answer ... and it's going to have lots of good he's packed in so if you've got a video doorbell today\nUm the answers is going to be available or early next year and it's going to have a features and capabilities just do not exist in that uh their product today\nOr the other thing is we've got indoor cameras coming also next year or so if you want indoor cameras again not to invade people's privacy but if you're not at home or on vacation or has pets or what have you\nUm we will have indoor cameras later in the year that can be on the same platform I'm as your other cameras on the outside of the house votes again customers love the yeah the law of what it does for their the corner of their life and the safety of their family\nAnd they're asking for more products to make their entire home safe sure well the quality of the video which I don't even know if we touched on his second to none yeah I mean the you know it's all each de but all of our products um are moving to the next generation of product to switches each DR\nIn a few of those of use it or ... or is it are\nYou today you see for gay or alter H.

I have a radio ad high check out our talk radio studio during a brand new episode with the legendary sir Paul McCartney\nNo I'm In treat them with Joe leading to talk about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about it a little band called the lead off we were when we were playing music or radio present in the city yeah check it out now\nAbout Saudi Arabia I'm Pam who sounds Fox News\nIf if you please but my real question is simple and easy is do you have to run the suckers twenty four seven because I'm a if you don't you know I can cut a fifty to a hundred dollars probably right there and then on my ...\nYou're right right well that's a great question a demon of fires are very expensive to operate a lot of people don't realize that even a little tiny portable ones yeah\nWas misled I was told when about pest control company when it was done that it would have your house so playing on an eighth and it is\nYou know it died in Ninety five degrees outside you can set up I don't eat there and enjoy yourself\nYou know but um I was\nTold that that money saved from that and sledding factor would be more than it would cost to run the date humidifiers and it's actually had virtually no effect that I can notice on any of the heating or cooling\nYeah I'm so when it's running twenty four hours a day what is the humidity level inside your home\nThe humidity level and shot at my home ah has traditionally and continued to be a little high ...\nOr ... even in areas like from one side to the other you know how they said today humidifiers\nA ... is the extremity on the kitchen side I'm a little higher and extra extremity on the master bedroom sat on the opposite as a little higher\nDo you have any idea what the percentage is the the percentages I mean is it below fifty as it above fifty or\nIt's below fifty but I'm a I've had some pushing and went to this because uh even though I'm a figure as guy the humidity humidity is not what am I right things but uh I think I've heard figures and a half thirties or around forty you know\nWell in all honesty were really where you want to be as in the winter time if you can kick it around thirty five forty that's fine but I think it's a stretch if you can keep it below fifty in the summer I think you're doing great\nOkay well my concern though is underneath the house and that was mode and every time we had the rabbit treat it\nRang wheel and it was probably run in Seventy percent then\nAnd and so once it was traded the um\nThe humidity has been unbelievably low underneath a house\nOr what they do they put the plastic on the ground and help yeah yeah they totally encapsulate so you have lemonade and all that water vapor\nWhile you're talking like a Fifteen thousand dollar deal\nRight right and I know exactly how much ...\nJoined I really Eighteen negotiate if you work on it\nRight but your question is do I need to use those humid fires all the time basically how\nCould I possibly maybe once a month a run 'em for about three days\n[noise] uh I Can't answer that because I don't know how much in flux of humidity is you've changed the environment by using vapor barriers and different things like this I tell you what I Would do\nJust totally locked and you know yeah I mean his hair free all your van ship and closed off and everything right\nSo what I Would do is I Would go in I Would buy a little like weather station that's about the size of a book you can put that up in your bedroom or your hallway or wherever you want\nAnd then the sensor you just place that down into the crawl space area it's going to give you the temperature and it's going to give you the humidity and you're gonna watch it\nAnd you know maybe there is times you can turn that off if it's really really hot really humid I'd just be real curious to know and I don't think you have to answer yet what that humidity level is busier you miss that on the humidifier\nI think underneath a house home to this but I think I heard figures like Eighteen or something like that you know Eighteen what on the humidity or reading or whatever\nOh it's way too low yeah you'll never needed that low\nYeah well I was told by another past guy that it might or pure hardwood floors you know if if you if it's too much\nAgain I think you wanted at fifty percent okay in the summertime below forty percent in the wintertime I Will get a sense are down there and the weather station so I could just manually monitor monitor it\nBy one of those from lows sure sure\nAnd then you can see what's going on and if you got it off for three days and all of a sudden that humidity level starts creeping up to fifty five sixty percent you turn it on you drive it down to maybe I don't know forty five percent\nQuestionnaire unless I'm abusing your time or the pope puppets of a it's a um one and a half horse and that's eight and me and about a hundred and thirty dollars a month right\nI was told by ... guy off or ... that once the temperature of the water hit sixty five and below chemicals added or a moot point because it doesn't react to the\nThat may be I I don't know that okay like that that that makes sense since it's logical for me that that that does make sense so at that point why have the filter or why of the bumped going Jim we got to\nGo but monitor that humidity no there's no sense in running the humidifier if you don't need it now however you gotta remember when you got 'em going full blast where are you right around fifty percent so you turn them off I\nGot to think it's probably going to go up a little bit but the cooler it is outside and you got a big cold front come through Florence\nWhen it gets cooler it's usually less humid and maybe it's something that you can deactivate him at that point ... monitor where your humanity level is\nAll right thanks so much for the call I appreciate your welcome to join us our phone number's eight hundred eighty two three

you\nHear me talk about a political mill see can we have Chris with us from mill think Chris welcome that almost Gary Sullivan\nWarning Gary how you doing I'm doing great how about you not too bad\nThere you go so you heard the stage kitchen cabinets I don't know around the handles probably most people's ah unless they're always using ... you're probably gonna find that a black grimy oily substance around the handles of cabinets or even on the doors of kid myths and tell us a little bit about ... it's got a long history\nYeah scary most likely to develop back in Nineteen fourteen by Hungarian immigrant mhm resulting second he was a master cabinet maker and you know products of is fun creations and that's when most like furniture polish and cleaner was developed and really that's what makes you know sex so unique is that it's a cleaner and polish\nIt'll take that Greece and grime off those kitchen cabinets and restore the would do its natural lost her like you said especially when they're on the handle your gang you get the grease on your hand you're opening cabinet doors we get that build up and no Sacco clean right down to the finish\nSo that grime we have is that cooking oil or what is that grime recombination ... several things I guess huh\nExactly it's a combination it's from ... from the oils in your hand on the Greece's you're cooking on and not all gets on to the cabinet and you don't have to use another uh you know use it ... other products you have to clean 'em and then go back and Paul ... or ... clean and polish almost up now\nWhen you use the word polish I I Know people use different spray cleaners different spray wax is to give them a little luster but even that wax over time get soft and grimy correct\nRight you if you use products ... over the years you get that build up where you can almost greater where you're\nFrom there yeah yeah no sec doesn't have any ... in fact no sick remove all that ... up and clean right down to the finish show on your dining room table you get a heat ring\nThat white ... networks built up someone such hot cat on there and it kind of ... so since no sec removed wax built up it'll take that heat ring right off the dining room table a watering off the coffee table\nAnd it will certainly have a lot of those calls in the next two months I guarantee you so ah so the ... there's no whack sitting there in yet it cleans what what's the secret sauce and you can't tell me the secret but uh I mean\nIt it's gotta be something special is silicone or no silk ...\nBuilt up as well right on your furniture and our our our furniture polish doesn't have any water and it it's pure cleaning and polishing ingredients in their trade secret ingredients and house formulated and allows or product to do

hardwood floors and lemon at floors\nYou got to lose their directions on the bottle you I don't think they looted quarter cup a gallon of warm water and you'd be amazed by the dark that listen to shine it leaves behind\nNow does it have to be diluted for the cabinets are just like the floors just for for\nJust for the floors otherwise use it straight and I guess you just put a little bit on it or on a rag is\nYeah you're just actually if you slightly dampen your towel and then at the mill sector the towel that activates the [noise] the cleaning agent in our products soda and clean and polish at the same time you're even candle watch you know we had to hurricanes down south and\nOr using candles that candle wax gets on the dining room table Romney what surface Nosek room that came

it says hey Gary heard you talk about this someone about give its are holes\nIn a driveway from ... is the word it's when the surface of the concrete just pops up holes are about a quarter inch deep\nAnywhere from two inches to four inches in diameter and um the product you used for that she wants to know what to use for that what you do is you will remove any of the residue from the spoiled area you would remove any dust\nFrom the spoiled area then when then you would come back and you would wet that area down you use the hose you need to use the pressure washer you just want that hydrated\nAnd you wanted as clean as you can get it then the patching material is a quick creep ... product is called vinyl\nConcrete catcher in Daniel I um I don't know if you're writing it back to him but we might want to do that to a violent is vital concrete patch or and that can be applied up to a half inch in thickness it's a powder you mix it with water\nAnd you let sit for about five minutes and it's a it's not a slurry it's a patch it's almost like butter in a tub at that point and you can use a trial you could use a white taping knife and literally just go around and just move\nOver those bald marks on the driveway or the negative of that of course is no concrete matches\nOne concrete from the neck so if you have a very gray concrete or this might be a little lighter than that if you have your from the south and you've got a little reddish concrete this is a little more than a great side than they do so tense if you've got a lot of it\nAnd of course there's also products that re surface the entire surface of the concrete\nSo that might be something to but the name of the product is modern concrete Thatcher\nYou can find it and most any hardware store or big box store or a dig in to get a question on board simply Dallas up at eight hundred eight two three eight to five five with Facebook pages Gary Sylvan public on way for the day and we've got all kinds of things\nTo do now [laughter] you liking your job today [laughter] so um yeah [laughter] well you can't say because it gets taken off the air [laughter] so a year\nSo you could also go like it's that or our Facebook page Gary some public figure and a poster questionnaire and we can get that answered also in the number is eight hundred eight two three eight to five five it sounds a little bumpy it's the first time we've tried it and\nSo I wanted to give it a whirl and see if that's something to make our show a little bit easier\nTo handle for you as you a\nTravel around on the on the weekends I wanted to pass that along a again that ... sale is going on that goes through Monday\nAnd uh we do have podcast on our website scary Sullivan online dot com or we're talking about the chimney and I hit a chimney sweep on a yesterday and I asked him if he has backed up all the way to Thanksgiving I think he kind of said close [laughter]\nSo when I can kind of start warn you in August ... encourage you may be to do something in terms of getting the chimney inspected um that's really the best time to do it right now every chimneys sweep a that is worth his salt is busy\nAnd there's an association if you're going to call someone to inspect your Jimmy it's a C. S. I. a certified chimneys sweep and a lot of cases are almost all those guys have cameras where they can literally inspect the inside part of your chimney if there's a problem they can show it to you\nAnd I think that's really important\nThat they can actually show it to you\nSo ah anyway\nThat something if if you didn't get your Jimmy inspected and I know you may have to wait a little bit but I Would definitely get on their list\nRight again ah well Mark's got a question mark welcome or a comment hello hey Gary how you doing today and good sir\nI just want to let you know I order that ... that are\nThat great deal on mill sec yep should beer and a couple\nOf days older and forward to it is good stuff and I'm telling you what that products Kelly I was in a hardware business you know twenty five years ago and I'm telling you what that products been around a hundred years yeah why I bought some\nI bought them a couple of years ago and I liked it and so now I Need all the more so very gay anyway you had a caller a moment ago talk about all these I O T devices Internet of things devices that can be an act\nAnd according to the IT professional though I work with the fellow says that um\nWhat most people neglect to do and this is why the device is so ... is they forget to go in and change the default password on these devices and often times\nDefault password might be a string of numbers like one two three four five six\nOh that's really easy to hack so you want to do\nWhether it's a baby monitor or it's this lighting system\nOf these Internet connected devices you know get into the instructions there and look for where the password Saturdays and go in and change the password come up with something unique\nYou know only new rules about passwords right combinations of letters and numbers your\nAnd character signs and and that should make it more robust and and I guess the other thing you want to do too as well as is most of these companies will ask you if you want to be on an email mailing list\nRight or promotional announcements and so forth you might want to sign\nUp for that because they will send you products bulletin updates that say hey there's a there's a new from where upgrade for this you want to download this from where upgrade\nSo they didn't get the best you know ... to production protection or whatever it happens\nTo be for the device float certainly a cat and mouse game right now and you put some clarity on there so I appreciate\nIt mark no problem thank alright thank you care [noise]\nHey we've been talking a lot about

Facebook Daniels has a question on Facebook not me but uh the listener Louis there was the question excuse me I had to take a drink of water there well you know stage Fred will get you every time\nA yeah says my garage has to drains one on each side in both cases the water drains off the cars in every direction but to the drains and he can do\nSo the floor is nuts slopes properly that's interesting\nIs there anything else you can do now I don't know you got to get the slope the water's got to get to the dream\nSo I guess one of the things you could do is you could put a thin layer of concrete or a concrete re servicing product around the rest of the garage floor to elevated so that in fact it does slope towards the green but that'd be a challenge\nEither going to add or you're going to remove also grinding some of the floor could create some slope and get the water to the drain it also might be better Daniel really just to put a curtain brain around\nThat area and you use that during\nWell that's interesting I used to you know ... they're not always trout properly I had before I'd put nature stone on my garage floor I always had this giant puddle\nAnd it was just you know it's been very much for drain in fact at one time I was going to install drain there and just move the water out but my wife is right next to her car\nAnd I'm so or temp she a car\nWas wintertime and she had drug some snow into their garage this tunnel formed she's stepping in it but when we had the nature stone installed we actually leveled out that floor\nAnd then put the nature stood on top of that was from Robert fissure by the way very good thank you Robert All right let's get Peter on in the Peter welcome\nWell thank you very much for taking my call you up here in Massachusetts where when\nClosed enclosed porch was slap a and we decided the calls and created an office\nOr and will be in ... to get right now just all framed in seal but it's a concrete or should we put panning on topic right on the concrete or should we at a sub or for a little bit of insulation or and make more warmer\nWell you you could do that that would be probably um your best bet to get it off that concrete of there's a product called dry core and a dry core\nPeter is um maybe sixteen inch squares of wood that hip polypropylene feet that may be extended up three eighths of an inch\nAnd their tongues in groups so you can literally set this whole floor together and it's elevated\nRight and that's good too because um that concrete\nCould get cold and then if it's heated you could get sweating\nSo given that whole thing off the floor is a real good idea\nThat's what we're thinking of the ... the concrete slab is likely and gold obviously to bring the water away from the house correct so so a contract that was going to sort of a cut out to buy or whatever is working so it kinda evens\nOut a little bit so okay that quite a coast guard somewhere other than the right to wreck\nYour head or right direction there's also a product so that was called dry core there's also a a ... for carpet um in fact they've got a four limits and they got it for carpet to different products it's called DNA mix\nAnd even though he mixes a insulating had that him as a like ... on it or a little feed on it and so again\nIt's elevated so if there's any moisture sweating you know it it can evaporate out the sides\nOkay ... so that it might be that or during this up for re should All right\nGood thank you my friend among Bye bye yeah those are two good products threat situation no question about it All right judge Judy welcome you're at home with Gary Sullivan\nHi Gary hello you were talking about the escalating the column face and I've got a different kind of question for you [laughter]\nI had a couple of guys and it might have to have two years ago and ... replacing outside profit from it that way [laughter] and the one guy he said he was really impressed with with the space\nThat I didn't go under I could see everything on end of the house 'cause there's like Bob down there and it it it insulated I could see an area where I'm Talking about underneath the you know actually the floor and paper facing is on the outside but\nIt's all covered over with tar paper ... mhm so is that three up all\nWell no I don't think it would be um how sick is that insulation ...
