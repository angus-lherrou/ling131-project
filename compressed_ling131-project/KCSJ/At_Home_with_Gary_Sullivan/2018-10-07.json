be able to okay and he's All right so can the ... if I make a bad lane change and cut someone off\nCould my car tell me a\nJust a channel just a heads up I mean it's all good don't panic or anything but you really did cut that person off you shouldn't have done what you did or or vice versa you know\nI think with the desires of there with the the change in the FCC law here a couple of years ago where the vehicle to vehicle communication ... was enabled\nAnd that is being designed probably as we speak that\nThe vehicle that you're about to run into could be controlled also by your decision which yeah scary ... where it could say I say scary but\nI'm going to move over oh there's a car they're the only way to avoid the Saxons to slow the other car\nDown so at that point then you've got this slight track of cars that are all being controlled right independently but yet but yet as a group hive mind yes exactly exactly [laughter] well done the so\nCould you have a virtual assistant in the car that would be talking to you I think it's totally logical to say that was a close one Chris [laughter] next time consider looking over your left shoulder Shannon you stopped a little bit close to that car in front of you [laughter] and I spent the summer age aircraft and also not only that\nBut the ... uh and I noticed that the driver of the other car did notice they looked at the mirror you could they some of those systems read where your eyes are ... and it would be\nYou've seem to have learned the drivers around you and your entity\nIs above the cause a problem for people around you whose blood pressure have all gone out of it [laughter] you've raised them beyond the average woman is that is totally possible it is totally pause oh that is you have a shared the person getting out of the car is holding a strange device\nBut the next step of that is\nShannon there's a McDonald's on your right hand side I notice that your blood pressure is a little low you probably need something to eat you might want to stop at McDonald's sponsored by you know all that stuff All right I brought some new what are you got\nA new start up I think this is all of these ideas that we're talking about good or bad uh this one I think is the worst idea ever\nYour automotive but you're about to talk about well it it exists so a new start up as a developed a way to get lazy people to work up a sweat by driving I'm intrigued the fit\n... it's a pedal powered vehicle that's what the ... is based on an Audi a four of onto powered by the regular two point oh leader four cylinder gas engine but control of its acceleration and breaking\nIs due to bicycle pedals\nThe peace even getting a horrible idea rubble idea the ... remove the accelerator pedal and in its place as a pair of bicycle pedals hooked up to uh fly will the accelerators control and that actually exists they've gotten done that they've done it the accelerator is controlled by an active peddling motion rather than depressing the peddling a conventional vehicle\nThey must have modified the foot ...\nWell too right they had to deal with this set up generates an electronic pulse to engage accelerator they've also remove the break and replace it with a hand brake located on the steering column\nConcept allows you know you can imagine what there's three modes drive fast for highway speed so it's like a ten speed Dr slow for slow moving traffic and no drive for bumper to bumper traffic drivers can also opt in for a harder work out via rotary dial that controls the pedal resistance that's the worst idea of member\nWhy did you not see that car that you just hit I was busy pedal and I was getting tired\n[noise] it's just a\nStanding out that my car will be on the side of the road with his hands on his knees was that a legitimate story and absolutely one yeah yeah it was and they're doing it in remember where they they have a car on the road of course but yeah it wasn't in America\nBut can you think of a worse idea than that\nNo [laughter] really it's right up there eight six six five nine for for one five oh here's a call that came into the who the hotline\nMy name is ... the two thousand seven he's on his uh eighty seven thousand miles on it for ... for so long the ... the sounds like squeaking perhaps on ... took it to get it checked\nBecause it really need the serpentine go changed it only has a set of thousand miles on it we should be holding off on that in order to secure some minor it's not hard to hear what it's like\nNot only a great question mommy to take this one here feeling happy I change\nThat eighty seven thousand miles is I Would say hundred ... this this is this I'm winging is making a hundred thousand it's probably about the uh interval on that and since it's squeaking it's telling you maybe there is I Would go ahead and changing nothing bad will happen\nI'm worried about the eleven years yeah there you go it's the time in the elements of eleven years is a it's a long time most recommendations are going to be half of that to replace the main accessory built on a lot of these vehicles\nNow having said that I've had numerous ones that I've taken past the five to say I wouldn't do that but but if you're starting to if it's starting to talk to you and they believe it's coming from the belt\nYou want to look at the belt and there are some of the ... and things like that that they make\nIf you look into it in the parks catalog and they have a\nCommon soul part it's a ... for that vehicle that can sometimes be an indication that get the kitten replace all the parts replace the rollers and everything like that but if it's just a tiny church I Would start with the low hanging fruit will develop on it while the belt is off have him just inspect all the idol or poll using different things to make sure nothing is\nExceptionally loose and you should be just fine so I'm more concerned about the fact that it's got eleven years on it almost twelve than I Am about eighty seven thousand miles\nIf he called and said the exact\nSame thing it was this vehicle and it works fine ran fine he wants to buy it and it is never had the serpentine they'll change you would say\nAbout changes that I I definitely don't change the belt and so that people forget\nQuite a bit is that it's not always the miles at the time and in the time that something's been in service has to do with the element if if that had been in a climate controlled storage and never been out in the elements you get\nAdvantage of making that stuff last longer but the the robbers and the and the tires or the belts the hoses all these different things they do do great overtime just from the from the elements of the of the of the earth's I'm\nWorking on it speaking of the same thing we had a call I was listening to a recent pod cast and we had a call from a guy who had an oath to tourists and we were talking about higher where and whether the tires needed to re replaced and ate codes on tires and I got to thinking about an hour to tourists and he said well you didn't drive in it was in great condition\nIs that a classic is that something you ensure as a classic not quite right or friends at Berkeley classics um\nHoliday would take that and that's a process that\nSeriousness if you had a car like that and you thought it was getting to be a classic\nUh and you're keeping it for that reason I Would definitely reach out to Berkeley classics dot com and ask them and they they would tell you\nWell in our professional experience so based on your driving style is what you're doing the car we we could potentially do this or we could not do the Ninety crown Victoria that we had earlier today and and now the fact that he uses that as a daily driver would probably disqualify\nUm can you drive your vehicle you around with a classic car insurance like our friends at Berkeley classics most definitely but there are parameters that we need to talk about so I think that the two tourists would be it's working its way into that window for sure and then you just go back by degree and it becomes\nA way of starting to see now people are put up

and in great flexibility also\n[noise] okay [noise] did you ever felt like I should\nBut I think his phone was dying as we were speaking All right so ... that particular product that I just mentioned by the way has the best at ... the best flexibility to pretty much any correct filler\nUm you probably don't want to use that in cracks that are less than what Charles ... which was\nThree a seven inch because it is very very thick if you have hairline cracks a quick remakes of products and acrylic self leveling sealer called correct seal those are for hairline cracks quarter inch caught cracks that type of thing but\nWhen you get up three a half inch self leveling your thing perfect if you can get them wider than that you know an inch which you can use it as you can use a backer rotten that

lighting and wow what a change there's been an asshole lighting over the last Twenty years and if you're like me you're probably a little bit confused\nOn what type of light and you use in our home even if it's L. E. D. there's different qualities and different types and different lighting so we're going to get that all straightened out we have carbon best story he's which GE Lighting and Carmen welcome that almost scary solving\nGood morning Gary how are you doing fantastic how about\nYou I'm doing great it's a great weekend so let's talk lighting because man we've been through quite a change over the last Twenty years\nOr that is we have we had incandescent lighting and used to be you go into a store and you know you knew what you're going to buy and then we went to a whole CFL thing and a lot of people are just just hated that lightning and now we're in the L. E. D. lightning so\nCan you can you kinda just talk about an overview of lightning in general ... kind of dig deeper [noise]\nWell it's a great time to be talking about writing October is energy action month for converting incandescent are halogen to Eli day is the right time to be thinking about it especially as they are getting\nShorter and I took any longer ... really has changed with almost come full circle Gary in terms of\nLike bald performance only had CFL we can have an energy savings and long life but kind of sacrifice that like quality or that flow warm up for that flickering whatever it is basically allowed us to do is to get basically the same performance that we had with incandescent\n... in terms of bright light dental comes on instantly what great color without having the sacrifices other things that we had with CFL and get the long life and the energy saving\nMan I'll tell you Eli de lighting is super energy efficient as\nIt is if you look at a sixty watt incandescent bulb now more than Ninety percent of the energy that was coming out of that Bob was heat\nMhm Mm yeah lady\nExcusing eighty five percent less energy it to the same brightness so you're getting an eight hundred looming equivalent sixty ... light bulb\nMhm using less than ten ... instead of our traditional sixty ... so it's a much better from an efficiency standpoint huh option than traditional incandescent off\nNow when I go to the store to buy LCD bulbs and I'm sure everybody's got one or two ... made the entire switch I get in there and I see flood lights I see\nYou know what is um you know like a sixty ... old fashioned ball and I see different price ranges there's different qualities of Eli ... correct\n[noise] there is like with anything in a home improvement store or had a mass merchandising store or there is differences in terms of performance there's differences in terms of quality because you're looking at LA de\nLa ... brightness they don't want to necessarily at the water's edge\n... has really what we're trying to replace when we're looking at a sixty what all is looming right does sixty what bothers going to produce about a hundred moments in the first four as I thought that has around\n... author lumens the second the you might want to look for his life so there's different tiers of LA days okay some last\nTen thousand hours on the last Fifteen thousand hours which would be three hours per day is scary to quibble aren't of having that bought last for Thirteen Years so you can do something different on your Sunday mornings instead of\nJust like all like the last one I ... it was like thirty thousand hours\nYeah isn't that amazing Adams fantastic camera that's perfect for me [laughter]\nAnd and now the third thing the thing that LA to his kind of opened up for us as on one hand we can replicate incandescent so they're looking for the soft warm light of incandescent bulbs\nAnd they can provide that but not everybody wants incandescent like light or maybe a different room is your house you want to create a different food or different\nEffect ... and that's the LAT has opened up so now Gary one of the more popular trends right now is vintage lighting loan yeah ...\nWhere you see the like old ...\nExactly right from an efficiency standpoint those bombs are terrible and they're using more\nElectricity but not providing a whole lot of like ... now has given you the opportunity to get that same look that came warm candlelight glow mhm\nBut using a fraction of the electricity so you're using five watts instead of terms he was perfect perfect and you're getting along life for this is an opportunity for even on some of those styles that you don't necessarily want to replicate what you had with incandescent\n... also switched LAT and get those benefits\nWell just taking everybody back from when they went to shop for their first L.

alright eight hundred eight two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can join us we're talking about your home and John welcome\nIdle and Gary Yes sir fine hey got an a\nOr some kind of bounce off you got a mobile home here and I tore out the bath tub and I'm putting a shower stall and its place hum\nAnd all the plumbing ... is in right now and when I see 'em a shower up to the rock climbing I'm using a suit chief I'm a brass a drain ... million with those\nTell me what's his name is again this is so cheap laugh I'm a drain that goes into the bottom of the shower stall\nCame with a Ninety degree brass type you know this is this is a straight and the ABC comes up on all okay into it and he put a new frame washer and they're right any type it down okay so it's like a compression fitting exactly and it's about an\nInch long and and here's here's my dilemma um when I tour out the bath tub there was a great big hole underneath that were the original Plame was put in for the tub and that's where all the mice were coming in\nAnd so I boxed all that and so now you basically you have to have a boxer with the rough farming\nOr going out to the septic system and then the shower sits on top of a on top of that\nAnd when I put the shower base in I can I'll never be able to get to the pie trap again it will be buried in that box um and I can't afford to have a leak in there and and so the PVC has been tested no leaks there that's all well lit up really nice my concern that Neal\nFrame washer and and so the question I have four years this\nOne I put that Neil ... gas cars I should call it out of ... if I put some silicone feel on that gasket as well and then fly it down into the drain\nAnd it goes around the PVC and then I tightened than not on top of it um ... when that silicone drive I should never have a leak there is what I'm thinking\nBecause if I get a week on ever going to know I have a leak because I Can't get it on the shower vase once I put it in ha ha ha I wanted your thoughts on on does that make sense that um\nTell me about the ... like the clear nylon plastic or is it rubber arise\nIf it's rubber I black piece of rubber it's round about an inch about an inch tall [noise] um and it it when you put it into the\nThe drain itself you got that compression not and it's supposed to see on basically compressed them um but the PVC can move a little bit and I live in moves a little bit I'm I'm afraid that seal is going to break 'em and then I'm going to get a leak and this is going to go over the water she's going to go down that box I built in of actually ... out\nIs that the end of the world I mean can you is that assessments that happened\nI got to tear the uh I had the quality of a momentary the blanket on okay\n'cause it's kind of the shower it's kind of in a metal okay and I'm I'm a ...\nIt was like the whole sharp pan or anything like that\nIf I could take up the whole shower pan but once I put the top half of the shower and so it's a full size ... at the bottom happen you've got top out when I when I put that path on\nAnd I feel like on those two together like the manufacturers said as opposed to I'm never going to get it out [noise]\nSo you got to come from underneath\nI thought I'm going to have to come from underneath the mobile home if I ever have a week but the challenges that probably never going to know if I have a\nWeek right right right yeah right and then it might come back so one of the problems I have with\nThe silicone and maybe I don't know your answer to this is I don't know if the silicone will compromise ...\nOkay I'm In I don't know I wouldn't have to look into that if I put ... ... is there a way to double up to ... you\nKnow it's if it's all designed to to work together as one drain unit you know so it's about an eighth of an issue that you know we're pretty sure that that's about an inch cause slide down it grips quite a bit\nI I'm also trying to think of all the times they've done plumbing whether those ... are ever failed it's usually the pipe that failed okay I'm In quite honestly a lot of times taken those washers off a re used them\nUm\nSo I guess if I were you um first of all I I really think of it sounds and you had a leak and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything you know we don't want to do it but it's probably not the end of the world it is

how long ago was that\nProbably Twenty years later that's pretty good and money tied yeah that's pretty good [laughter] so that's really sad that that's really\nYour option so aluminum siding whether

crack it's not going to absorb moisture so it's very stable\n... preparation\nAgain the key runners she'll do that the rhino shield is just heavier duty than a pain it's yeah so I guess it's a coating it has\nMore reflective properties\nIt's going to listen I mean that paint last really good so that you know I mean that's certainly an option for you\nOr the rhino she'll be probably one and done I'm going to say it say lifetime warranty I could be wrong on that I come at forgive Warren he is but I Know it's a long time it's at least twenty five years\nUm but\nDie it's perfect for ... is perfect

not happening\nIn the insulation mhm I have ten dollar hit that lady I'm Wondering if you think that they were\nTrying to remodel trailer with that and now it or what we should\nBut I think the first thing you need to do is you need to confirm whether there's black mold and there are a dangerous molded doesn't have to be black a dangerous mold or\nNot I'm ... and you can do that to buy um\nInexpensively amber it's um it's a\nFive minute mold test kit you can get a mid ace hardware\nIt's almost like a pregnancy test kid it's a little plastic device in a swab and you don't have to swab the mold you can just swab around the tops of doors you some of the you know there's usually dust on door frames um swab that and inserts that into\nUm into this test kid is it'll tell you if it's dangerous mold or it's not dangerous moment if it's dangerous mold\nThen you really got to consider whether it's even worse remodeling that\nUm because\nThat could be not only just in the insulation that could be on the\nUm backs of the uh panels of the walls\nIn other words that trailer may not be able to hold is valued to take care of that\nA particular you know the issue so the first thing I Would do amber is is test for mold and then kind of make the decision from there as far as the league you know whenever you have water introduced to a house\nAnd you have organic material there is a good chance you mold and may not be black mold or the dangerous times more but you would have mould\nAh you would have maybe a common variety of mold that wouldn't be so dangerous but I I'm thinking you got some big issues with the roof leaking and you've been sick and you've got um\nUm you know you're able to observe that there's some mold and the insulation of patching the roof I don't know how old the trailer is I don't know what the problem is somebody they have to take a look at it and see what it would take to get that straightened out but I I'm going to venture to guess that the answer is\nI'm no it's it's probably not going to be money well spent in that trailer or to um to get rid of the mold and to reconstruct it All right thank you much for the call appreciate it and good luck to you Alan welcome", "year": "2018", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "07"}
