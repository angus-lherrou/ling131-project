middle east gonna make a lot of noise and he had to sit there [laughter] yeah it's not going to they're no they're not a powerhouse by any means you're dealing with a a really low horse power\nEngine that things have changed so much\nNow I mean we're talking about even some of the really weak vehicles or you know for a hundred horse power in in some of these bigger things now where we were lucky to get a hundred and fifty to yes hundred and Seventy five out of some of these old big engines you know they just did that\nI've driven a lot of older Chevy Truck and they just had a lot more you know or or get up and go to this thing does\nWell and part of that could be because it's old a ... it's just you know I I Know I got to have a valid on\nWell wow yeah and then it'll be old and warn of [laughter] I've seen have you on a fire truck that Scott thirty thousand miles on it [laughter] yeah they're they're shot a\nYou know a lot of that has to do with idle time a lot of it has to do with just the components that they made these things out of and their ability to the not wear out in the fluids that were available the time\nA new like you see all all the time no cars now we say oh two hundred thousand miles it's runs great so good good car well the same car made with thirty or forty thousand miles that was Thirty years old the\nThe things you're going to want to do those still just like any other gasoline combustion engine is\nIf it's if you if you just acquired it you know make sure do a cylinder test to see what kind of healthy you have just a simple compression early down test in each cylinder easy to get at the spark plugs for the most part and you could check just to make sure you got healthy cylinders\nAnd at that point to make sure the timing is that correct or make sure that the U.S distributor and is in good shape\nYou know just some of the the carburetor or you can't always do much with those if they're operating correctly find out if it's open to all the the uh [noise] you know all the correct or butterflies and everything it it just makes it chokes not stuck\nOr just stuff like that that can make them extra doggy but they they weren't awesome to begin\nWith knowing a lot of those the timing is off but they they had so little contribution per cylinder to make up all eight that um\nSometimes if you disable one cylinder you really didn't hear a huge difference in the engine but if you've got that one ... ... it's gonna be noticeable while you're trying to drive it but it may still run pretty good at all\nIs it a straight sick yes so does it seem like it ... if you're in your polling gears of the better ratio does it is it the same way if you like in first gear second gear\nIt it's got a little more slapped them and then you get up to the higher a speed but\nThat's you know what I got to talk about the scout again because I just can't stop myself wanting to scout in a in a local small town drawing for the American legion as a fundraiser and it was somebody had donated it was just to use\nA little bit rusty scout and I'm like oh this is kinda cool what year was it I Want to see it was the Seventy\nFour or five I'm going to go look it up we've an orange knows white it was a hard top was it was a believing that had a thrill for a V. eight in it or something like that and\nThey yeah and it was definitely an eight and for whatever reason into will drive that thing could spin the tires my ... one of my best friends and my cousin tied he snapped the drive shafted it finally we we've got a little too aggressive with it but that made a\nA number of runs up the split rock river when it was frozen in the wintertime up into the trees I could talk about it now but [laughter] it was a I was the wrong person to pick up on my life [laughter]\nIt was free right so I bought a raffle ticket right okay but what it was you know their bottom of the split road I Know we we we sold it to somebody who was\nStill serviceable\nThanks for calling we appreciate it Don Don thanks very much\nFor the call good luck let's talk to Nathan Nathan you're on the end of the show what can we do for ya\nI I I got a two thousand five Subaru Legacy wagon and we've got problems with their rear suspension or the back of the car say almost looks like it's been lowered and we can't seem to figure it out on what needs to be replaced or what's going on I'm\nOn a whole batch shock springs all that had been replaced in a funny thing I think it's gotten a little worse some kind of look on friday of I mean I've even found on line where a couple of different places are shows actually selling thinking about strangers for sure we're so I don't know if this was a common problem if that's the solution or not\nWe're all those springs and strokes replaced with brand new parts and it\nWas I actually replace the old just order the whole um shock and spring altogether I didn't want to mess with a ... percent of the springs now\nAnd when you ... you know was it good as soon as you did that for a short period or is it still exactly the same\nI remember it being a little better but it never really fix the issue\nThat the same problem with Graham freeze in Ninety seven but we'll leave for a full ready throw it on there with everything on it correct yeah exactly yeah and it right on some of them were just lower like what the grand prix in that car they just they set\nA little lower when they were brand new they were good for ten thousand miles than they settled and that's the way they said they were lower and if you don't like the way they said they do have some time space available when you put those spaces in sometimes you do you why Mitt sometimes you don't depending on\nWhat is it modified in that suspension on a car but they they do right off the wall ones I can picture in my head right now that our customers have most of them right pretty low\nI pulled it up on Google Images all the images looked like the back in ... like they all look like they're saying look at a little bit\nI guess I'm trying to understand if he's described as something where he is or if he had some of those ah you know those things people hang on the Republican they'd be dragging on the ground or if you know how low it is in your nicknamed the cars for a while there but the\nJohn ... there's a hitch on there and it drags out it drags you know\nEasy and that's it that's not all the all the way many yes [laughter]\nYeah there isn't a bunch of weight and back or anything but it just looks like it's lower than it should like something's wrong with that were suspension\nWell just trying to think of the way the cars you know the ballast in the car if there's anything that could be on the front they become just trying to think through the geometry of the car if there's anything we're missing here\nOr anti sway bars are are going to stop typically left and right when you're keeping the car flat when you're going to a corner that really shouldn't have anything to do with it um you know as far as the suspension at the back\nThough some of the cars not this one day and have it like a true a transfer Springer cross with sometimes crack it when people would like in the grand prix the earlier ones that was a common problem but\nNot in this kind of a car it's it's kind of an independent suspension with that strike\nThere's only so many single that there is there's only so many things back there I Would say that if you're any\nIs there any downside to putting those Pacers enemies or anything that's going to\nKnow as long as the other it could harm something you want to give you the line you know you want a good qualities but he says it's not okay for ink on you and then you want to do the line 'cause when you changed the height of a car the\nRight you're going to change the alignment not so it's gotta be gotta be aligned after that's by the justice than even the ... like Chevy Truck so a lot of people with the least cricket so then the dodge do they want to have leveling kits available for them to bring you end up you want to make sure those things wind good\nYeah we did that on my sons pick up we put the level or get on the front spring blocks to the back just to bring the right how are you up a little bit and we brought it down and the rangers had it still wind after that just to get back into true and that was recommended operating procedure\nNathan thanks very much for the call good luck that'll do it for another hour and the under the who'd show until

... on that surface Andrew you feel that\nOr whatever that is is where the smells coming from\n... to ... which are not true I mean it's\nYou ... have you done anything at all with it at this point I mean having\nTried by a ... foot and a quarter inch long down over new carpet and it's still there yeah a lot better off the chair that are looking at online research a little bit of this scale and uh\nWell I think a few in an odor a eliminating product um for sure uh but um I Am a little little concern to what that would be\nUm you know we're trying to solve something we don't know what it is but there's there's um I don't know if you've ever heard me talk about a product line called odor exit\nOdor exit makes a variety of products um from sprays into actual chlorine dioxide which actually eliminates\nThe the odor in the air so\nThat may be a product you want to take a look at or you may want to give this company called to see which one they would present you didn't have any pets it's nothing along those lines correct\nNo place for that aspect I you know they they didn't really hang out in that room ... with a closed off\nAll right All right ... you know the one interesting thing though is when you put that Lou won over we really can't get to the particle board now I'm\n... I'm On a campaign room I owe it kept pulling back well\nHere's the website you can also get their phone number there maybe talk to them and I'll talk about the two products I think that it worked for you it's odor exit oh deal are X. I. T. dot com\nThey make a A R G\nRight there and you can read and they also have a little short to figure out which one is this doesn't match the odor this kills the odor okay they have one called ... concentrate\nWhich is I think more for natural\nSmells you know animal issues and things like that I'm In that's why I asked that question is really going to be on\nThe area that is kind of infected with his older so we got carpet and then we got Lou on and then we got the problem areas so this probably would not be the product\nThen they also have one called odor exit magic which is just an air\nA it's a spray it doesn't have to be on the problem area just in for the uh the environment in that room to eliminate that order 'em then there's one which is I really think the product you want [noise] called a cue em\nAnd its air quality manager and this is an excellent product for eliminating [noise]\nEven mold spores in the ... and I know you don't have mould but mold spores in the air a in a in an enclosed area car where there's a strong nicotine smell it all lemonade that I'm viruses so it it actually kills\nThe older I'm I guess spores that are in the air it's called a cue whim um so\nWhat I Would do is I Would tell you to go to that website read about those products if you want to call them you know Monday morning and give them a call ... dumped coaches through the whole thing um compare the cost and then decide whether that's what you want to do or do you just want to ... be bored out and be done with it\nWell I'm just I'm trying to way mobsters you have to cover their return in that room ... gets you there and there's also the outside all\nDay in their ... and you know I've I've read you know or you might have molded it might be in that but if the rest of the house doesn't smell right\nAnd you can get a I'm a very accurate mold test\nUm and even that eight cue him that I just talked about that oh actually kill the mold spores that are airborne\nBut if you there's there's a a product called a five minute mold test kid it's a swab so you could swab the dust on top of the door frame everybody is dust on top of the door frame and you put us in this little boxes about the size of a pack of cigarettes and it'll tell you if it's dangerous motorists mold because we all have mould in our home\nThis just tell you if you get something that's dangerous than a home or not dangerous in the home\nSo that might be another option but I I'm really lean into the a cue whim a at the odor exit read a little bit about that maybe even talk to them and then make the decision whether that's something you want to try or you just want to get that bored out of there\nOkay All right All right we're going to show\nThanks standard take care Bye bye alright

D. P. rubber a which is much more durable which is a stick on also and then there's some with frames that are more substantial with all vinyl bowl but in the moment I'm frame that's the direction I Would go also the joint between the frame and the exterior and the interior walls might take a look it\nMay be putting some uh ... and they're the one thing I don't want you to do is don't concentrate on ... the bottom of that frame\nAnd a lot of cases if the openings or at the top or the sides and you know wind driven rain and water gets in being kind that frame if you see your clock the bottom that water cannons scape\nAnd then we hold that water in and that's why you see so many door frames that first a bottom twelve inches of the wood frame is just totally rotted\nBecause we trap that water in there so you know the ... can be done on the sides you could be done on the top but not at the bottom also take a look at the bottom of the door at the threshold there's a couple of things there that are creating a seal there's the threshold which is wood or aluminum\nOn or with a silicone and you can clean them very easily I always clean him with middle spirits\nCaught and cloth mineral spirit's just wipe down the tracks you'll be amazed at how much turkey get wiped down the glides and then just spray the tough on her silicon move the window up and down and you're in business\nAnd all that cases you're in business there's\nThere's um obviously if you have an issue with it and the parts broke and uh you got to get the part and there's a lot of window parts companies out there and you can also look on line I mean they'll have six and seven million ... million with an M but um at least you can still find parts\nFor a lot of the western window up in the northern Ohio areas one and uh there's many throughout the country really but a meat that fell to show all the dime tells me his infant Tori is in the seven million range so uh\nTake pictures trade pictures order them online\nUm any gaps or flaws in the construction around the frame um can be cocked again always be careful of clocking any piece of wood down at the base a lot of time you got to let that water Cape and talking at the bottom really can cause bigger problems\nUm weather stripping on some of the a\nVentilator double hung windows can be replaced\nAgain knowing the type that knowing the configuration of the channel a will be key but those\nWeather stripping parts can be replaced\nAnd it is just like weather stripping a door in a lot of cases just sliding it in to the channels so those are a couple of things you really want to take a look at it before it gets too uh too cold out cleaning windows and I know they just lost a lot of people they don't do windows but really cleaning windows\nOr extend the life of a window remember window glass is a liquid\nYes it's a liquid you look at\nReally really old glass eighty Ninety a hundred years old you ever knows how it's wavy\nAnd it's a liquid but a glass um needs to be clean it can get a little pits in it I'm\nIn one of the best products to for cleaning glass that I've come across is the jaws glass cleaner or J. ws I Know kroger's carries it and a lot of parts of the country now you can also get it in on line at the jaws cleans dot com\nBut I Would highly recommend that in fact it's a ph neutral there's no silver spoons or alcohol in that\nAnd what that means is you can use it on a glass like um high def TV screens computer screens getting and use it on your eyeglasses I'm the one of the things that what about yourself on screen cell phone screens another one that a lot of sensitive you got to\nUse a P. H. neutral or civil no alcohol ... glass mayor I had a friend of mine asked me the other day said actually my TV screen but now I can see kinda ... streets in it and I said\nWould you use\nThat issues in say common brand of a window cleaner and I said it's got ammonia and it got alcohol in it it'll streak that finds screen and they go well how do I get rid of it you don't\nYou don't\nUh so ph neutral or products like the jaws cleaners um\nI Would highly recommend that glass cleaner and you can also get it on Amazon meeting about that prior to it because of the spray bottle and um it's got cartridges so once you spray that onto\nThe glass and you do all these windows in your bottles half empty you don't have to go out and buy another ball you when it solve away empty can fill that up with water\nTake that cartridge and just put it in the neck of the bottle and run the spray or through it and it just versus um the concentrate in with water and you've got another bottle you're you're ready to go so um you don't have to keep buying the bottle and all that saves on storage and everything else but\nJaws cleaners a check that out another tip on clean the windows and we're talking about the weather is ... and just kind of getting things all straightened up um is some paper towels not all some paper towels have a little bit of wax and them\nSo if you're using\nA good product like a jaws where it's gonna be streak free always use a micro fiber cloth I'd stay away from the paper towel some are great I'm not trying to just knocked\nPaper towels newspaper that works good to know no ... newspapers but a micro fiber cloth ph neutral\nProduct like Charles you're not going to have any streak in a glass so then you've lubricate decide you replace the weather stripping and you clean the glass so he did a really good job of uh\nUh getting those windows are ready for winter and again just make sure they're locked when the weather gets cold another the ghetto would windows you may not realize this you can actually clock a window close\nSo you know the old double hung wood windows when the wind blows you can actually hear rattle\nAnd um I think we've all lived in a house where that was the problem and if you still have those in your house or you can tighten those up there is a product called draft stop\nAnd what you it's a clear talking that you can literally clock that ventilator closed\nCan't open in the middle of winter though a bus clock closed income march that little clear ... will simply a peel away but if new windows aren't a budget or maybe you're just you know bought an older home you're refurbishing it you cough those ventilators close take some clear plastic\nThose when the kids in put those on the front I'm telling you can take a really old\nDraftee inefficient window and you get yourself another year or two worth the life out of there and really minimize the draft are coming into your home so that's a couple of things if\nYou know I'm not really encouraging you do that right now but come January that might be something you want to take a look at if we ever really really cold winters just ... closed plastic over it [noise] you

types\nOf cracks in the wall themselves they always say there's more cracks on the outside then there is on the inside and if they're on the above grade there's probably some below grade too but let's address the one's above grade\nWhen you're examining the foundation and you see cracks in the foundation those can be patched up with either a zip it mortar which is a neat little package a murder that can be applied to a vertical surfaces I'm you could also use a hydraulic\nA concrete patch little darker and color in most cases and I'm also dries really fast but if it's above grade I don't think you really need the hydraulic patch you just need some zip it motor to cover it up also look at that ledge if you've got a brick house\nOr encountered this not long ago when I said really taken that walk around the house examining needs things keeps not only ... keeps insects out and\nI have a an invasion of aunts and I'm sure we can always talk about using products are getting exterminator and take care of the answer but really why not take care of their entry point into your home and when you're looking\nFor a a problems when you're doing your weather ... it and we just talked about cracks in the foundation take a look at the brick\nOr sometimes right on that foundation sometimes getting the binoculars out and just kind of looking at the whole field or bricks which you're looking for is cracked the brick\nA crack mortar missing mortar and that's exactly what I found which was right on the a ledger the foundation and that's where I was having the invasion of the ants come in and they're marching right through the mulch\nAnd up into the crack can you know we go we solved that problem by getting in\nA some patching materials ... than solving that problem but that's the type of things you're looking for a crack brick\nA missing mortar a cracks in foundations and get those things sealed up also you get utility pipe she got ... phone lines electrical lines cable lines males slots all those items that I just mentioned\nAre penetration into the envelope of your home and addressing those issues\nWith a ... keep the moisture out some parents have to do that and again whenever you're doing a like a gap between uh say gasoline is run through the foundation or phone lines or whatever\nA low expansion phone to get back into that grows and seal it up is ideal yeah you can use cooking if you want in fact if you want to finish it off with talking that's fine too but I get that low expansion phone\nThere's different types of home ... expansion low expansion if it doesn't talk about the degree of expansion of the ... expansion forms usually used for doors and windows\nSo you'd just sleep for phone for doors and windows and\nAnd that's what you'd want to use around the even the hose bibs that are going through\nThe um through the foundation also take a look at the clothes dryer vent boy I'll tell you what their big gaps around those things are great entry point for mice and a lot of places not far off the ground if you take that ... and you can just take your\nPick your hand and just see if you can shake it wobbling around I think you'll find that a lot of cases\nA ears does wobble around you\nCan connect that to the brick or the woods citing caulk around that or again getting some low expansion foam in there and then securing that good will seal that up and keep critters and called us from going in\nWas it to my son says in the laundry room was always freezing cold and sure enough\nUm that the driver vent hose ... my goodness there was an inch around that entire hose that entire vent pipe and once that was sealed up and connected certainly took care of that problem\nHer and her phone number is eight hundred eight two three eight to

week Israel fix some things up you have a house or probably a few things that are broken have an older house\nYou've probably got issues with plaster you probably got issues with wood that has rounded so river friend Richard in from amateur on which you know we're talking about all the time but ah Richard\nGot some good news Richard welcome that home of Gary\nSylvan hey Gary how you doing guys been busy haven't you it it has\nBeen busy as do all of our ... so a a ... a must be getting still rotting in\nAnd out and just keep getting older you know what it will never stop it'll never to Zachary let's talk\nA little bit about would we had a call yesterday in fact in I recommended your product it was a I think one you and I talked about many times and that was they would call them and I can't remember how old the house was whether there was a new one or old one but\nShe had some of the wood that was rotted and there were suddenly clogged underneath it so it was hold water knew it was a disaster\nAnd said you know what do I do can I mean just cannot patch it and then went yeah yeah you can yeah yeah it can you take us through that project I mean is that something a lot of us can tackle\nYeah yeah that's something we hear about all the time is a good rotting basis of columns and whether there's solid columns or whether they're how columns\nUh there's there's a there's definitely a way to fix yourself um and remain factor two different a pox the products that are ideal for making those repairs\nUm whether what starts to bed with what starts to rot\nI'm rather than having to replace entire column which you do is you use are toxic products called liquid would and where he talks and talks to patch up those bases and it's a real simple process or any of your home or can can use these products\nI'm there to talk to them and our liquid would product\nIs a penetrating pox he would heart or so\nWhere the would start school go bad and it gets a rod and hockey and saw right um what'd you do is you brush away to lose crumbling materials that that that would rock creates and then you want to saturate all that or anything with black or using that liquid with product\nAnd go liquid would will penetrate in a deep into those fibers and ultimately it solidifies and heart and all that soft material hides it all back together um and make some monolithic repair heartening all that would\nSo I'm so structurally it's throngs\nYeah absolutely absolutely the the liquid will it has a press the strength training over five thousand PSI so there's a load bearing type ... repair product chair this isn't just a just a a band date it's gonna sail last until you sell the house this is something that's going to last\nFor generations to come and uh you know just a quick quick cover up a product\nAnd then you'll take your ... moved out of the debt point\nYeah exactly so you want to saturate those routed areas with that liquid water and then uh you actually apply what a pox while that liquid would still wet\nTacky and sticky and the ... is another part of proxy but rather than be liquid this is more like a party or filler mhm and you use that to patch and replace the missing sections of all it\nSo you can fill in and rebuild or anything that's missing and you can do barrel checks and cracks and splits in the wood or you can rebuild entire\nChunks of of missing material that you need to so there's really no limitation to the to the scope or repair that you can make up something like that so\nYeah that was actually one of her concerns and I'm sure you hear this all the time and you know with a column she was getting ready to just dig all this out and she was in me whether that would be a good idea or with her column fall down basically\nAnd I'm going well you know ... you don't want to go all out right away I mean we\nYou know and then I went in explained kind of how the liquid would works and boy that is that's the tickets for the for the call because you just can't do that with any product\nBall right right yeah there's a lot of a component products on the market that uh like I said there are there ... there are there are a quick cover up type product or they're or they're meant for interior used or something like that so\nYou know when you're when you're making that type or repair you definitely want to make sure that you're using something structural unstable or something like a two part solid a proxy liquid ... types or\nNo you folks at every turn him good news about these products and no because for years or for a few years that I've been talking about that I became aware of and I know you're really involved in the restoration industry\nAnd and now reaching out to you know the white guy and it can really take care of some of these issues around their home\nAnd we were sending them ... or send the Amazon but now they can do to your local ... right\nExactly yeah we're we're pretty excited I'm Greta ... products or have just been added to the age distribution network and uh\nUh so we're we're just trying to get the word out because a lot of the white customers um they don't necessarily understand that a lot of the a stores uh and they apparently are hardware stores in stores um you know the the owners of those places are looking to those customers to find out what type of products they need\nRight now and now our liquor who would have ... products are available through that age distribution channel and so if you can't hide it at your local a store already\nA ... or ask your you know the the order the paint the paint manager that local a store and they can they can order those products right and they can they can get them on the shelf for yeah\nSure sure hum rape products and certainly make those projects that look a kind of overwhelming a obtainable and um you know as you just kind of walk through this is a project most people can tackle it to her home\nAll exactly yeah exactly are we simplified the products they're they're ... years are easy to mix there say to your ... your seas or are you asking are nasty chemicals involved with these products\nUm and you don't you don't have to be a pro you just have to be able to follow through simple instructions and uh\nAnd anybody can can use an and create a successful repair\nYou can also share than half a block on line [noise] teach

he's eighty six years old\nAnd I live with him and he asked trouble\n[laughter] because I can clean up after yourself right in any way to lean real far over\nOn he's calling me right now but I have a Lincoln toilet when he landed over\nTakes ... around the bottom on the base so so I'm On the\nOn the floor yeah so um what's going on there is a that toilet is not stabilized\nOn the floor or is it is a little bit um war and so in that toilet that sits\nAnd just to kind of give you a one on one on how that world is you've got a four inch pipe the sewer line that's coming up\nAnd you got a ... and you have a wax ring the wax ring then ... at the bottom of the toilet and two bowls anchor the ... toilet down to the floor\nOr which goes through the uh little plans and secured what's happened is all the way it's been shifted under the front either those boats have become loose they've broken probably just became loose and that seal is become compromised\nSo when we're flushing that that flush of the water in the toilet bowl is since the toilet is not sealed to lose the a pipe properly you're getting a little spill out on the sides so what\nYou need to do is you need to shut off the water you need to take that floor off the land ... I'm In that ... again you can't get a puppy nice scrape off that wax ring and then I Want you to get what they call a perfect seal it's a little bit easier to make disrepair with this Mike\nIn a perfect sealed again mounts on the ... much more durable than the wax ring even though there is a wax ring butts in case and rubber I'm In you'll tightened that up real good your ... to for a the toilet to the floor and I think you're going to eliminate your problem\nAll right my friend thank you much for the call I appreciate good luck with that in Charles welcome\nGarry Yes sir I got an interesting problem alright I had\nSome holes in my garage walls and I got those patch just fine the problem is there's a ... on the war that looks like it's them with a like a quote unquote a plaster tight finish that's kinda runny and rock\nOkay I'm Wondering how could I replicated back [laughter]\nMillion dollar question Charles I'm so there's all different kinds of techniques for that all different people have different techniques and even if you try to duplicate the same technique it's difficult\nBecause we all have our own kind of artistic touched do it so some people do um ah do use brush around brushed they'll the opposite for texture others will have a half moon or half around type trial remotest\nRick [laughter]\nUh no no no I didn't know what do you mean by gripped\nA ... it it it kind of done like in a vertical fashion and it looks like it was just going to be when they put it on the walls\nOkay well that's probably your tip 'em that's probably what they've done they probably took topping compound I Can't really visualize what the design would look like ... and I mean I'm so um my guess is they would take topping compound and a drill was the big mix or on the end of it\nAnd they would\n... the un out the ... of that topping compound and then probably take a like a wallpaper and brush uh I'm In literally do what you just said kind of drifted or whatever\nThinking yeah yeah I think in there's real low answer to it Charles I tell people try to imagine how that person put that on get a big piece of cardboard\nAnd try to replicate it you come close you probably won't be perfect but you come close but it sounds like if you're talking about but you know a dripping\nOr a a rain type a finished on there I Would use you know the topping compound diluted a in just maybe just a little bit sicker than paint in just kinda I'll use the word slap it on with a wide uh wallpaper and brush uh-huh\nThat what you're saying chopping compound would that be like using a ... a pre mixing your yup\nYup yup just use a regular um yeah pre mixed a I call ... ... and just mix more water and to get more Ramy\n... show hey that sounds like the solution\nAll right good luck tonight thank you take care of all\nWell we're fixing up all kinds of things if you'd like to join us loved the heavy it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five earlier in the show today somebody called and said men I loved that middle seat furniture polish one of my favorite products to it cleans and restores\nWoodward wood furniture in perfect for kitchen cabinets it removes the grime the dirt scratches the old wax from the wood and then restore says by the way it's also great for removing\nThe heat rings and water rings that we get on the kitchen table it's middle sick and it's ... am I.

and I know exactly what you mean is just to smack of fat to get that role or to push jets flying in take a snippet of that's flying in and get the next size down there's there's only probably six different sizes\nOf blind if it's snow again you just can't quite get it down and you only got to go down to the next\nYou know the next size will will get the job done for you\nOne more I've had the most trouble with is a screening closure and it's a it's a flat and it has reached someone once you go into the group\nMhm there's a slight recession to the to the left side mhm was sacrifice fires not\nYeah I'm familiar with the flats blind to and in fact I just got done some uh this summer I have a big screened in porch in those panels all have the flats blind\nAnd I'm I'm trying to think how I chose this point I think I had some at the house\nI'm In the one I had a the first one was too big the other side's fit in just fine I put it in with the roller and I don't know if if if I if I didn't measure so I don't know\nI had one at home that was too big and I use the next I downloaded it worked fine but I I get the challenge\nUh but I think if you can measure that actual opening\nA you address the the issue but I I get it on that flight buying that can be a challenge [laughter]\nAll right thanks much down a couple of tips too if you're going to work on that um you know doing the show for thirty one years you kinda forget some of the tips you've passed along in a screening tip this time of year is a great screening tip here's the deal I'm you know the time changes next week right and so it's going to be\nDarker in the evening and we're going to get in a lot of parts of the country more the dreary time of year\nYou would be amazed at how much light is blocked by screens in your windows we got fools screens in your windows I'll bet you it's going to block a third of the light that's coming in your house may be more\nAnd if you get a good fall day papa new screens out you know if you think we're pretty much finished with opening up the windows pop that screen now take a look at the screen screen that the fiberglass screen it lifespan of that's ten to twelve years and they kind of gets thread bear\nAnd now the fall is a great time to go ahead and do your ... screening get it done on the big flat surface ... screen the screens allow more light in the wintertime\nAnd then you'll be ready to go in the springtime when they go back in ... and didn't know which one goes into\nA witch a window\nStart with the one the window closest to the kitchen sink and that's number one you just take a little sharply put number one\nRight at the top of the frame and then go clockwise around your house number\nBut replacing that a a screen now is a great time of year to do just that and the ... line that you're pushing that rubber arise a membrane into the ... the whole screen intact\nThere's ... tools looks like a big pizza cutter but then there's this line get this ... mind mice no we've got that wrong ... line mouse and it I'm\nJust check it out the hardware store as from what they look at you like you're crazy doesn't look like a pizza cutter ads of about a half circle flat in this blind rolls over to rollers and it's much easier process of pushing that's line into the groove\nSo good time of year to tackle that particular project eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five Marilyn welcome\nCarrie yeah um I\nNever I haven't heard five uh-huh [noise] I had an ear ago and I went after the latter half how I'm back here and I read the directions we have our our car [laughter]\nSo I had her hair mayor come out and get kind of having a little bit of problem\nI think they are you finding them around the drain rabbit around my bachelor Harris okay around that drain also [noise] um\nYeah we'll we'll one thing is and then we'll tell you about Ken\nMaintenance so we don't have that problem or one of the things the shallow bowl\nUh with um\nA little water a little apple cider although apple cider vinegar and the drop of liquid soap\nAnd set that up there'll be attracted to that oh okay and um that will attract them to that and they'll meet their demise and that'll help but they like everything else are looking for food\nAnd that's where they're going to get trapped in your little trap that you're creating but what they're living on this sounds a little gross or they're living on the bacteria in the scum that in the drains\nAll right so I I say often everything we use anymore as Jill we got Joe ... Joe ... everything's jailed and that sticky\nSo like me I use a gel a shaving cream I'm shaving in Washington dumped going down the drain but that gel even though it goes down the drain it starts slowly a coating the top of that trap or the top of the pipe inside portion of the pipe\nAnd that a gel combined with\nFlaky skin some risk yours is the bacteria in these little guys start finding it and they started feeding on that and so there is a a product\nUm that is the silliest it's actually a like a culture bacteria that creates enzymes that eats that bacteria\nOkay so we're live lead to a point were cleaning the inside of our pipes\nOkayed that particular product it's also used to a ... claw blockages and things like the current piping you he uses a maintenance product gets called drain right at her four ounces of water I think is a forget whether it's a court of water but\nWhat I'll do is like in the bathroom vanity\nOr you pull up the plug the the stopper or you put four ounces of dream but when you're a little warm water and there are ... I think it's ten minutes\nAnd you release the water it flushes down coats the inside of those pipes if there's any minor blockages it eliminates that too but that starts eating all that bad bacteria and so you've taken their food source away\nOkay can I get that at the box or am I\nAm I I picked up at eight so I think\nDo at best carries it also uh I don't know if it's in the big box stores or not\nI did take the garbage Clapper ... really\nGood I forgot to tell you about and so other people listening let's repeat that that little splash guard that rubber ice bladder we put in food it grinds and up it spits it all over the back side of that\nAnd that and it has to us right now and\nOne other question around radical I Know how how do you ever heard of that ... ... ...\nOh yeah yeah ... yeah\nWell the the ceiling probably less than the others\nBut um I'd say a polish every two weeks ... if you want it just makes that granted scream I'm so cleaning it you know whenever it gets more when I go granted does\nWe clean it with the the wipes all the time and then polish I'd say maybe once every couple of weeks or so and it makes that granite really pop usually around the holidays coming up I'll take a little spirits are water spirits the granite and if it just you know doesn't appear to be soaking in\nI let it go or if you can't over seal it so no I just got a protected\nOK
