reports heat up for you she's wide receivers demi ... to play through a hamstring injury that according to NFL networks Ian Rapaport\nThree catches twenty six yards total in or even weeks Eighteen catches two hundred and forty four yards and encouraged out when they were taught him this week it's an odd week about let's leave him on the sidelines showing McCoy just because people are still foolish enough to think\nHe's a starter he's got the ... is a terrible zero touchdown he just the top forty rushing yards\nIn a game you know better than a\nDesperation likes play at this point you can find another option given some of these high powered off and I'll take my shot what the second back in those games with the heavy over\nJust says you scratching your head what happened two weeks ago against the Vikings [noise]\nBecause last week than the bills are skunks by the Packers and everything gets back to normal and you're just what what the heck happened we\nThree not not only on the bills on line but on the Viking sideline\nBiking go ahead lay range lands and I know that but you know with the Packers I like the fact that there were all salty that they love points on the board of course they also left every wide receiver in home\nFor all the injuries they have but we'll get into that over the course of the day was let's talk about Aaron Rodgers not that you're going to city um altogether but he's back in number one way going against Detroit even if everybody was healthy he'd still be an interesting story this week looking at a Detroit\nTeams given up just fourteen fantasy points per game two opposing quarterbacks event in the national football league all the banged up wide receivers ... still out when the lions are but they'll have developed a Adam's then we'll have Jimmy ... and they will have a bevy\nOf nice young targets including a Valdez gambling used on the radar\nAs he the way in your daily fantasy leagues in a wing a wing of prayer kind of option Korea we gotta keep going Carlos Hyde against Baltimore Baltimore given um eighty eight total rushing yards and her gamble they want\nLock steady as they go top Fifteen wide receivers have gigs a couple of slots higher here going up against Philly given up nearly ... thirty fantasy points per game do opposing wide receivers if most and the national football league already six touchdowns allowed\nA for the eagles I've I've got to look at Carson winds and even though it's been on even less far he's got all shown Jeffrey back he got Nelson Aguilar\nAnd you look at that Minnesota deep and it's I don't know what kind of speech anybody's given right there's talk at a at a coordinator went over and he talked to the\nThat's going to solve anything he can't play [laughter] you can't pick up the Anthony barring coverage there\nAre still going to be some problems in the back seven your point about Jeffrey and Aguilar being available for the eagles and Jeffrey of course things up early on in the season the eagles or the U.S percentage of wide receiver targets in the NFL of any team they're throwing to the tide ends the throwing throwing running backs more than anybody else\nIn the NFL maybe this is the week to turn that around if you're the Philadelphia Eagles\nGet a little bit of a quick release planes and teams that are trying to get at you aggressively obviously the early issues for next falls and then when you look at cars and why don't you want to see how mobile is right so you're going to bring the house\nSo this week you know you're you're going against a team that hasn't had a pass rush right he ever driven situation or we hope he's got the help that he needs and can get his way back onto the field but his absence\nTakes away one of their big past Russia opportunists and they've had zero and after coming to an opposing quarterbacks or the first quarter of the season\nAs you said it's a field goal difference in this game you play them on a neutral field to be a a pick 'em if you will between the\nEagles and Vikings I just don't think you see the same things play out and I know that there are different faces different players but even though this is really the what a span of five games that\nThese these teams have played since the last play the meaningful game against each other and we had a few championship I don't think it plays out like that game did in January\nWorlds apart and that his personality changed over so much the number of injuries and when we\nWere talking about an inch season right where you have a stretch of a couple of games that come back and physically and we see it in college certainly right\nThe after effects of running into an Alabama or one of those teams that two to three weeks later you're realizing how many injuries uses yeah it's it's the same thing here that the cumulative effect of running deep into the playoffs and even winning a Super Bowl there there's ramifications that following you into the next year\nIs my comment I'm Dan ... is a Fox football fantasy you can always reach us on Twitter I'm at the end by or on Fox Mike they can get you and me over and swollen dome will and we still have you on beatings after week five in the national football league we answer that question after Brian\nFamily gives us the latest of what's happening in the world of sports come on and Brian good voting guys thank you so much for having me\nI'm a ... day thank you so much just an absolute honor to be here what's ah what's happening in college football major league baseball and of course\nThe national football league the national football league will injury news as we approach that one PM eastern kickoff Vikings running back Donovan Cook is not expected to play because of a hamstring injury\nBagels running about Joe mix and has been activated however his teammates Giovanni Bernard is a no go she's wide receiver semi Watkins open to play through a hamstring injury Gordy Dennis network Sienna Rapaport and as you had guys had mentioned Texans running back Lamar Miller\nA game time decision in college football late last night Utah studying number four team Stanford there were three upsets that's often\nTexas over number seven Oklahoma Florida\nTaking down fifth rank to LSU and Mississippi State beating number eight Albert and to and all the playoff games today Rockies brewers for thirty seven eastern time on him and all the network Milwaukee you have to own that series and the Dodgers embrace country into seven eastern on Fox Sports one LA ahead few games to none\nAnd the guys back to I'm Brian Finley thanks Bryan we appreciate it of\nCourse the brewers and vouchers can go for sweeps today Yankees Red Sox even up at a game of piece of that divisional series are interesting to say the least than the America because the Yankees got one last night in Boston off of yep you guys that\nDavid Price nice effort David Price a buddy his confidence not shaken see I Love that people keep trying to push the narrative that it's not enough of a sample size I don't know\nClearly there's some problem right one once we start getting into the number of starts things had against this team and the number of playoff starts then he said\nThat there's something there oh yeah it's it's it's not like you said one every three year or some small sample size and I know statistically speaking for all you people going back to your school days and what constitutes a a a proper sample size for a survey or anything else I think we had for David Price at this point\nIt's the thing and it was talked about this summer in New York in June ... say thing and Yankees know what in the last night they proved that\nEven up that series at a game apiece this is Fox football fantasy he's my comment I'm Dan by our company laugh at the guy feel Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with guy go go to guy could I comic all eight hundred dollars for seven auto the hard part figuring out which way is easier\nI just Mike I'm just saying this because I just have a sense and know it's easy to take recent history and go back and say okay this is happening this is what I've seen over the last four weeks\nI Know that the rams have been dominant in the national football league and I know that the sea hawks\nAren't what the Seahawks once were but to have a team be more than a touchdown favorite on the road in Seattle gets my ears perked up I think the rams actually today was more of a ... a more difficult time with the sea hawks and people would want to imagine\nBut I'll tell you what so far the ramps have really had no difficulty whatsoever Sam the first thirty minutes against the raiders were served as their preseason rice team has been rolling ever since\nNo that's just and it was their preseason effort to get things started we look at Seattle how much the loss of Earl Thomas planes in writing the flame magnificent football uh before flipping the bird to the sideline and\nBeing carted off surgeries successful and and everything we know we get those reports earlier today on terms of the rod insertion and everything and gruesome details but a huge should\nWith rehab probably be able to get back on to an NFL field but his last now becomes a question of what does that do or that the Seahawks defensive you got to pick your poison right you got three guys oh and that Todd girlie character to contend with I'm with you know when you're looking at seven or seven and a half wherever you came in on the line\nUh it seems pretty lofty Seattle for all of its\nIssues and all of the the scuttlebutt and consternation and all the stories we've had in the media\nThe defensively they played pretty well and from fantasy purpose in ... bears out there looking at six best the best against quarterbacks eleventh best against running backs and so obviously the wide receiver and tied in position fall in line there and so the opportunity here\nOn a road game that\nAlways looking from where's where's the potential for a let down yeah and and where an opponent has with a little bit of an early push decided advantage you look at Seattle primed for potentially the upset spot here or at least to make things difficult for Jared often go\nIt will be interesting to see of Seattle can give some resistance to that ... would you said is with with the three headed monster of of woods cup and cooks and then you throw in a really and it's really those poor guys it's something that that we've talked about on the show\nYou're not going to hear a lot of Jared ... office thrown into a different guy knowing that you know that's that's not going to happen it's going to be one of those four likely doing the damage for the rams head of the ... can run the ball in what is the second home game of the season\nThey they control the clock against the cowboys in their first home game of the year use Chris cars that a lot in that game he didn't play week for comes back we'll play this week\nExpect Seattle to really try to run turn the clock and get that run again going to get to the ramp\nWell and that's the big question years you've got a guy like Mike Davis\nA twenty five touches over a hundred and twenty yards and to scores\nFrom out of ... and now you had Carson back so potentially with that it it should settle in for the rest of the Wilson not that he's an offensive juggernaut and right now twentieth among quarterbacks for fantasy purposes and a guy that you're probably sitting down\nToday waiting to see how it plays out a lot kitten and Marshall and whatever you have going you're not going to play them on this one right I think they might be able to ... up a little man with the with that attitude and and with that game plan that you you you propose and now it's\nIt's imperative that someone's got to show resistance to this all up and at some point right ... it's not going to run roughshod over the lead to this level but as soon as you got a Cooper cup ...\nTrailing in with a linebacker trailing yeah as they add I mean that that's the beauty of the off and tried as you're always finding right which guy gets matched up with the slow linebacker that now has to try to keep up across scraping across the middle there's nobody that's going to be able to do it\nSo that was the C I still have to figure out the day the jaguars in chief and the other matchups featuring the other on beating than the national football league they are Kansas City they are home they are likely going to have semi Watkins today a despite the questionable tag but here comes the chiefs on the shore week but at least they're at home taking on Jacksonville today\nOr if you want to go down that route you've got Ryan grants or one of those you know one of those secondary receivers Chester\nA just a Rogers even though you had a couple of\nCrucial miserable yeah in that game or you know because Andrew Luck doesn't throw at the on twenty yards too often twice you tried to do it to Rogers and bounced off his chest one in the end zone one that would have been a huge pass completion\nBut you know the targets are certainly there uh for for him obviously that doesn't help you for today's games as he's already way but\nA lot of those two I'll give Anderson a slight uptick\nYet or if it's not today it's never how 'bout that that's ... that's about time I waver wire otherwise he is my comment I'm Dan by one mystery man clue already review he's a six year veteran in the national football league and since she's been of the leak there only been to other players from his college to enter the NFL\nWhat is clue number two for our\nNumber two for mystery man he has caught successfully eighty six percent of his targets\n... well that's pretty good that's not too bad [noise]\nMystery man who number two year old Fox football fantasy it's someone you've got to get in your light up we're just given clues to who that person may be\nSpeaking of clues are I think the saints are running game is going to be improving over the next couple of weeks like it even needs anymore improvement as one mark Ingram is\nBack [noise] he has returned\nMarching from NIH back from his four game suspension [noise]\nBlame for the same [noise] some moron I against the Washington Redskins return on the\nRetired off the back [noise] marking per se backed by the same [noise] how much karaoke to just take in Vegas as we\nHeard there was it a lot there well actually there there is there was that there wasn't any oh we went to the the uh the swaying again or if you will as it swings for mark Morris in our own line everybody\nNobody's thing because of their own voice now you can\nReturn to the back marking goes back for the saints up this week of course they have ... we talked about taking on the red skins on Monday nights middle\nNumber ... running back this week for Ingram obviously upside potential in terms of the red zone opportunities that may avail themselves when you look at Washington overall on defensively they've been pretty doubt uh opportunities are only a hundred and\nTen yards a pregame are rushing yards allowed plus one touched down that's for the season two opposing running back to the debt to hell of a job a dust bar but for the St Drew Brees you expect him to get his record and everybody will do the the wave and the pomp and circumstance and now it's a question of beyond Michael Thomas\nWas catching the wouldn't home for him right it's been a lot of come era yeah and they'll say that you had given pops up on the radar and disappears as quickly as he did get married at that is one touchdown reception\nAnd then he disappeared so I think it Drew Brees Thomas ... little bit deeper you're getting run but otherwise those secondary receivers and even Benjamin Watson are guys that are falling to the wayside\nAgainst going to miss the game because if a bum nice change heavy by in weeks six falcons dealers we've touched on here and there are just especially big band in James Connor and Antonio Brown in ... and Vance ... Donald in Calvin Ridley and we'll Jones in\nMatt Ryan in am I Am I going wrong any ... Freeman is back we could have done to return to the back as there are the three men human seven Coleman the backfield\nOr just a lot of guys to play in Pittsburgh yeah both number choose a when you look at Coleman and Freeman coming back or probably more a wax option for you there\nAnd that I give us a little bit of love I Will get Austin Cooper in All right on the way as a a deeper tight and like\nHey you know what box football fans he brought you buy discover become a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more I discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nAaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers don't have many weapons heading to Motown\nHow will that fair for the green and gold will tell you the next year and Fox buffet\nOkay Ben matter here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me you're just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service rover Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their train specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy go dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\n... helped me find them back home pros in my area the handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the problem check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that Holleman minds are is completely greedy you go to ... dot com or download the ... to get started and\nWe just we're delivering the sports and entertainment you may yeah yeah they get the job and it knocks you out\nYou lie manning has been better the last three weeks he struggled week one but he has been better the last three weeks how ms completion percentage is much better the numbers if you just look at him he's been much better\nIn the last three weeks but clearly [noise] there's not a threat to go ...\nAnd in today's NFL when you're watching the LA ran when you're watching the Minnesota Vikings when you're watching the Kansas City chiefs when you're watching a Tom Brady throwing the double coverage in the end zone Josh Gordon maybe college kind of changing a little\nYou know what I mean like when Mitch tribute skiing had sticks touchdown passes\nThat when you take a step back and go what are we watching again or what's going on here this doesn't really uh I'm I'm ... I'm confused or that one one minute yeah he he can't throw those like the next minute he's throwing six touchdowns I'm a little confused here so\nThe league is changing it's an aerial attack down field it seemed like in every single game and you got you I mainly who can't get to the fall down feeling [noise]\nAnd I'm not saying that to take a shot at him [noise]\nBut it's the truth [laughter] he line manning was the longest pass completion on the season is thirty seven yards [noise]\nThat put him thirty six in the NFL behind every starting quarterback [noise] a couple of backup quarterback\nAlbert Wilson a wide receiver from the dolphins and Kevin ... fired a safety from the tight [laughter] all those players have a completion longer than Eli Manning the season [noise] that's a fact\nYou can podcast all of our shows like searching Fox Sports radio when you're twenty four seven sports and entertainment network\nWe are box sports radio ladies and gentlemen\nFind how many how connected traumas which\nIs coming right for you then what's the weather is now Yahoo Sports national columnist discovering this blockbuster trial surrounding how much guys are getting paid to go to play college basketball and dad is one reason why this isn't getting a ton of attention spans just don't care anymore\nI I Would think so I mean I don't know how you take good things here is like especially if they lose this trial because they're basically trying to stay committed a federal offense of wire fraud spiritual sort of walk by by offering the schools fought in the schools you made a player ineligible for these guys\nPaid Brian bowling junior to go to Louisville\nAnd by doing so they made him ineligible to play at Louisville and that's Louisville was defaulted because there had been algebra playing\nOut kick this coverage\nWith ... you want to talk about a way to start ... six AM eight thirty three I'm pushed it back on Fox Sports radio\nJunkie godly show when you think the media is anti Cam Newton the media voted him and beat the the media voted him Heisman Trophy winner\nIt still work may May Day I Am can and I just want to download them dollars just for the name too I hard radio another chance for you to win one thousand dollars coming up but by the hour every hour Monday through friday boring am until may be right here\nIs the biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already all you\nYou'll miss the iconic performances John\nMiss [noise] Sunday\nOctober seventh what's new today on the free I her radio radio talk\nPerfect for decorating the house or just setting the theory move our pumpkins by the pilot has joke tracks with labor in mind when you know after a day\nWe're going to Larry Walker Jersey the guy's a millionaire on out only throwback or do you go to her and they did not show the river so let's get to the cold sores for a week five of the national football league these are guys you don't want to you don't want to see\nThem out of your lineup cold\nSores ready highbrow announces tomorrow Coopers in an odd week [noise]\nAnd I mean on the ... yeah wanting three's been terrible doing where he's been phenomenal this week he's got Casey hey we're on him [noise] I'll look for the secondary and tertiary options\nIt particularly Jared coast being bigger weapons for Derrick card this week are we taking markets Mario against buffalo I'm curious to see how he follows up last week performance rather Ninety school yards three total touchdowns look at buffalo still\nFairly solid thirteenth vast against opposing quarterbacks plus far this season on the verge of where he gave us has a fantasy world excited because you're trying to buy new number one wide receivers that break out he's a tough way though is buffalo\nA pretty good against the split as a as we go on a couple of cautionary tales the quarterback position in other words they're down markedly from where you don't really see him and the ranking and that's my homes\nAt home against Jacksonville I'm not going to bench I'm outright even with those Saudi numbers from Jacksonville but certainly we're not expecting thirty points [noise] going up against the squad many I'm Aaron Rodgers\nWith his bevy of injured wide receivers of on the ...
