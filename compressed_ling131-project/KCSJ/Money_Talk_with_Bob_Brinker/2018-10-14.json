designate is to create a will\nAnd obviously if you have a simple estate things are not complicated there or do it yourself resources that you can use I don't particularly recommend this track because I'm concerned that if a mistake is made there's going to be a problem\nSo I don't really like this particular track but yeah there are ways out there that it can be done\nVery very important item and you know over the years on Monday talk or for our regular listeners and we thank you for that by the way while we're on the thought\nSo many of our listeners over the years of called about rip offs and I was reading an article this weekend in the New York times about this very topic a very good article that appeared in the Saturday New York times and it really is a cautionary tale\nFor those of you involved with for example with your parents money\nMaybe involving business with the brokerage and how many times that we had callers on money talks talked about this very topic where they have a ...\nThis particular story that I reference and I recommend to money talkers involves a brokerage account at a major US Bank you know a lot of the banks have brokerage arms so this account was at one of those brokerage arms the details are named in the article\nSo\nThe daughter of of the individual that was the focus of the article the daughter of that individual\nFound that there was unusual activity in her mother's account was she was overseeing and had been overseeing in recent years and one of the things that caught our attention\nWas at the account dropped one hundred thousand dollars in just one month during a period while the market was increasing most of this money was in the market despite the fact that her mother was in her eighties which doesn't make a lot of sense to me but that's what the article says and I'm sure that was the case\nSo the account was very very heavily in the stock market despite the advanced age of the owner of the account\nSo the daughter hired council hired a forensic accountant or a forensic consultant one of the other and they found commissions and the account for the year\nOf one hundred twenty eight thousand dollars\n\nOne hundred twenty eight thousand in commission's charge that the ... the year which was about ten percent of the total value of the account this amount being paid out than commissions in a relatively short period of time\nWhat what happened was most of the portfolio had been sold out and then the money to reinvest it and of course the commission's piling up on all of these transactions and in one month alone they found three hundred forty four trades\nThis is really staggering and it's real and these were in the unsolicited category well unsolicited means directed by the customer but of course that was not true the the mother of this story was not directing these trades in any way shape or form\nAlso another thing they found when they did their forensic work was pieces of stock we're being sold in small watch so if you had a thousand shares you might sell Seventy five than a hundred and twenty five and so on and so on even in the same day\nAnd of course that can pile up the commission says well sometimes the commission's can be larger on usually they are larger on the smaller\nLots sit ups the commission costs as well another thing they found was that was a margin account which allows you to borrow money to invest more well you don't do that when you're in your rabies and if you really smart you don't do it at all\nSo as the article describes there was a settlement was reached but obviously the overall result of this was kind of ugly and unpleasant\nAnd this is something that's common excessive an unauthorized trading are among the top complaints in customer arbitration and this is according to the financial industry regulatory authority ...\nAnd the FCC has issued an alert about churning they call this churning when you're excessively trading and account\nThey issued a warning just last year on this so this is something to be aware of if you have elderly parents and you're wondering what is going on with an account they may have at a brokerage or whatever or the bank rivers as in this case it's something to be aware of because I'll tell you why I said this\nThe sharks are always swim shark swim twenty four seven they never rest\nAnd I don't want them to take

quick questions of course I listen you're not on live in LA I listen to you on TALK shows why\nAre we are on ... we are on we ... we are on a ... a different schedule but we are on KBC Los Angeles you'll have to check the station for the schedule that they keep yes we are on KBC\nBut not live I'm so sometime sometimes is the answer is sometimes\nOkay great listen I have a I'm retiring next year\nOr have a four hundred and fifty K. and um [noise] some funds that I wanted to invest in number three ... number three [noise]\nAnd um I I Want it to find out when you talk about dollar cost averaging One Fund that size you typically suggest you know four five six pieces um per dollar cost averaging\nAnd at the at the back a little bit of a background you know we just passed this last week the longest running ... market catching up the nineties\nAnd that's why I'm anticipating\nBased on your mark where which was very helpful in October letter or a year ago you said trenches term shut back this year and so I took advantage of that thank you very much\nA that does help pay for the you know the letter many many times over a but anticipating a market a topic and the next let's just say the next year year and a half um dollar cost averaging ... family how many\nA piece of should I be putting my money into our apple you know how should it be breaking up into\nWell uh when would you be doing this investing right now\nI Would be doing it yeah within the next month or two\nYeah I Would say on model three on a fixed income side of the portfolio that um I don't\nI don't regard need right now and the central need for dollar cost averaging on a fixed income side\nAnd the reason I say that as we've largely inoculated that fixed income side of the portfolio by selecting a short duration portfolio assets in fact our average duration on a fixed income side now is less than one year\nAnd so with an average duration of less than one year and the current ills on that portfolio in terms of the interest income stands that a little bit over three percent\nI think we've covered the basis on that side of the portfolio we're getting a nice yield\nIn terms of the current income and we've a reduced the duration down to a\nVery very low level on equity side really that comes down to your tolerance for risk to some degree\nBecause the fact of the matter is that um\nIf you're going to a dollar cost averaging money and you want to do it in a way where if something goes awry in the market you're not going to panic and do something in this going to be counterproductive\nSo I Would move it in on a schedule that you're comfortable with in terms of of your tolerance for risk and I think that would be the key in terms of of how you'd be moving that money and\nYou're absolutely right we're looking at a market that is basically the longest bull market all cyclical bull market ever were nine and a half years and so are there had been times to get really excited about putting money in the market\nUh I remember the a secondary by signal we had a secondary means we were fully invested so it applies to those looking for an opportunity we had a great a well an awesome secondary by signal in um\n[noise] back in two thousand\nEleven back in September of two thousand eleven yes be five hundred was in the low eleven hundreds I mean this things than the twentieth hundreds now so that was an awesome by signal we had back in September of two thousand eleven\nAnd a and I remember also we had a a terrific secondary by signal because we were already fully invested so this was for those looking for that opportunity that exceptional opportunity\nAnd that occurred again in um February of two thousand sixteen for crying out loud the SP five hundred was in the Eighteen hundreds or talking about an index is twenty hundreds now it was in the Eighteen hundreds in February of two thousand six team won again we had a secondary by signal\nSo I mean they were fantastic opportunities but but\nThey don't come along every day opportunities like that don't come along every day so um I mean even people that dollar cost average money into the market in two thousand Eighteen at the at the lowest level we've seen they were still in the twenty six hundred area\nThe lowest closing level we've seen in two thousand Eighteen\nWas only in the twenty six hundred area no big deal we're in the twenty eight hundreds so those kinds of opportunities that we saw in September of two thousand eleven would the S. and P. five hundred trading and the low eleven hundreds wow that's a buying opportunity big time\nUh and the kind of opportunity we saw in February of two thousand six team with the S. and P. five hundred trading in the Eighteen hundreds well that was a terrific buying opportunity for certain\nAverage clients settles for about ten percent of what is owed we offer free face to face consultations in your local area call eight

have a grandson\nWho was sixty just turned sixteen and I would like thing of the stock market\nHe's got a head on a ... you just received the ... of around twenty five grand\nAnd they had a savings account prior to that but he saved up to like Fifteen hundred bucks over a long period of time and I would have ... paper work out you know so it so he was doing something I Would like to have\nTo know uh I was thinking about fidelity or or um uh\nOne of the uh the scope stock houses where you can get information\nBut then have him do the you know do the actual trade when it comes to talk about it together and try to pick the right one and then start investing some of this money got\nWhat we know what I mean I think I think it's a good idea I think that a meal only need a three thousand dollars to open a a a personal personal account how old is this youngster\nSixty\nYeah okay well you want to have it ... through may yeah\nOK you have to do a cuss the custody accountant actually ... but then he'll get to be Eighteen ...\nAnyway [laughter] so he says\nI'm I'm ... so he doesn't get tempted with the with the money you know [laughter]\nWell I I I think that it's fairly easy for a personal account for example would probably about three thousand dollars a vanguard probably about twenty five hundred dollars or so at the ... the first one that I Would buy would be to get started would be the double the sparked in\nTotal stock market index or vanguard till the stock market index depending on which company you go to but I think that's a great way to get started and then they can dollar cost averaging says he wishes going forward\nI think the only caviar is that you know as he is going to need money\nIf he's going to need money going forward then you know\nHe's in a position where he has an investment account in that case in the stock market which certainly tends to fluctuate as we know\nAnd so there should be money that he really is investing a on a longer term basis I think as as it gets started move as opposed to a money that he's actually going to need to go forward while the appreciate the call bill is in Missouri bill it's your turn\nI thank you for taking my call I'm trying to determine the best way to withdraw money from investments when I retire\nI'd like to tell you the two approaches I'm considering the first one would be to take four percent of my investments each year starting with non IRA one Sasha gone go to regular IRA\nAnd then ... fire re approach number two would be to take all of my interest dividends and capital gains\nAnd then if I have money left at the end of the year I weighed reinvest it\nDoes that make sense\nWell I think it makes a lot of sense for you to collect your interest and your dividends against that four percent withdraw guideline that you're starting with because I think what you're going to find is you will you will have some years\nWhere the some of your interest and dividends and capital appreciation could exceed that four percent figure and certainly uh I Would reinvest that money if that happens there'll be there'll be other years when they match up very closely\nThere could be other years where your dividends and you're interested in your capital gains a dumped him up to the four percent which you in which case you can liquidate a small a number of shares in order to get to that four percent figure but I think that that should work\nOkay\nI Would say that I'm not sure that ah I liked the idea of putting the traditional\nA tax brokerage account before the raw\nTech ... you know because the money you take from the ... just a gallon his tax free if you follow the rules\nSo I think I'd probably do a slight change there I'd probably priority to prioritize the personal money and then I'd probably use the raw money and then lastly I'd probably use the traditional Monday because that's going to be taxable when you take it out\nOkay I'd reverse the order of those too but I wouldn't actually tap into any of that ah until one of those years when I didn't get four percent by taking interest dividends et cetera\nYeah and and then that ... that's a good way to look at it and uh\nYou mean where you didn't get the four percent from your personal portfolio right that's a very good way to look at it because I'm what you could do then is you could use your lost money as your backup money and you still would not create any tax liability by doing that\nOkay thank you very much for your help\nReady to hear from you built checking in from the show me\nState in ...

Bush the president\nMade a proposal right to to invest a small portion of the Social Security fund in the stock market if that had been done\nThat would have done extremely well because he made that proposal when the stock market was at lower levels much lower levels for a door during his two terms so if they had taken up that idea the place to small portion in the stock market which would have to be indexed\nThen uh that money would have done extremely well unfortunately Congress which can't seem to agree or how many days in the week there are any more they're just in case there simply dysfunctional they're incapable of govern\nWhat maybe there was a condition of talking about is that that money cannot be touch Social Security the time and age and maybe they're concerned that passed laws\nThat money is going to be in touch prior to that that is the risk and the stock market but also this money could be invested and I'm thirty three years or so the U.S government\nUh or twenty five or ... what should be it would give certain uh returns\nWell they all ready invest a lot of the money in it and they already invest the money and the equivalent of us treasuries right now they do that right now\nBut I thought it's all I Do you I thought that\nMoney and all of that uh yeah but that they consider it the equivalent\nBecause that's the rate of interest that earns is the equivalent it ... it it earns the market rate of interest one has invested yes you're yes you're right there's no money there the whole thing is a\n... year right now because you know why because all the money is getting all more and more and eventually all of the money is getting paid out of the the people who are currently working paying Social Security tax and then they take that money and they pay it after the beneficiaries and that's where we're headed\nAnd so the whole thing is a under the unified budget\nThere's no question about it uh this whole concept of a trust fund with money out there yeah it's I always use you're absolutely correct but I don't see any any one first of all I don't see any one politically in Washington stepping up on this issue it's become the third rail of politics and they don't want to touch it they don't want to cut Medicare either\nA in terms of making those fiscally responsible they don't want to go near it on the other hand uh I don't see the votes in Congress to get something done on this because they just are well they're totally dysfunctional and they've proven time and again\nThemselves they prove that themselves\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one it is on the line listening to the mighty WLS Schuchat although it\nHow about this in Chicago I got a a large portion of my money and money markets that are not covered by FDIC and I'm trying to fight a that is a problem the reason that I have the money and money market account\nOr is that\nI'm not sure how long I'm going to live and I don't want to tie up my money you know a like a CD for a longer period of time or or even a shorter period of time so that it would be a a hindrance to my\nEars and I'm Wondering if there would be a problem with keeping it in\nA money market at this point in time\nI think if you're with quality companies companies like the vanguard companies like fidelity any of the high quality companies I can only speak for myself I don't have a problem having money and money market funds because I'm worried about it\nBut I mean you would have to speak for yourself on that issue as to whether you're comfortable with it or there's another way for you to do this which is to just do in the short term treasury bills which can be liquidated the anytime\nOkay\nYou could use for example if you owned Ninety One day treasury bills three month treasury bills\nThan a those monies can be liquidated at any time and they're perfectly safe or and or not only that the interest is exempt from um state and local tax so that's certainly something for you to consider you would not for example you would not have to pay\nOr the Illinois state income tax on interest you earned on a treasury bill so that might be an increased incentive for you to take a look at like ... or something like that and the rates have been increasing as the Federal Reserve continues to increase short term rates\nAnd so that certainly is something else is going on\nAnd I do appreciate the call\nAnd that was an interesting a speech that the fed chair Jerome Powell gave at Jackson Hole Wyoming this week I Hope many of you had an opportunity to uh read parts of it or even more that you've had the chance to go to the ... in Jackson Hole Wyoming\nBut uh there's no question about it that he has made it clear that uh he's going to continue to watch inflation buddies not particularly upset about inflation right now\nAh and he certainly has made it clear that he's going to gradually increase short term interest rates until they get to\nSome level of normal and um he he doesn't seem to be flourishing in any way from the the program that he has set forth which he basically inherited from\nA from a chair Yellen his predecessor which is to gradually increased rates of interest as the economy grows and as employment grows and as inflation remains manageable I think that would be a synopsis of his view\nAnd I think it's a view that's generally accepted at this juncture\nIf you'd like to join us on the toll free line we'd like to hear from you one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that's our number one eight hundred nine

by the Federal Reserve that target level is two percent to point out\nWell it's been like right in the one point nine percent area recently and based on the ah estimates that are out there are some people expect to get up to the two percent level when a when the data is released on the revised gross domestic product\nA this coming week there will be the revised the number one day that there'll be revised number two data coming a month later\nAnd so that's just quarterly data though that's not the import all important in your your number so when we take a look\nAt the fed policy\nWe have to consider okay they're raising rates okay they're throwing debt onto the market in the form of the corner the tightening program as they remove it from their balance sheet and very large numbers\nTrillions actually over time and so all of these factors come into play and that's why it's really important what the fed chair says about\nWhat's going on with inflation and what he's saying right now is he is not\nEspecially exercised about the rate of inflation that's because he's focusing on the fact that we've had this personal consumption expenditures core inflation right in that one point nine percent area perhaps to go to ... percent soon well he's OK with that because that\nWas the level that the federal open market committee established as its target back when figures were lower now the reason and this comes up all the time the reason they don't want to go below two percent\nIs because they really fear deflation\nIn the eyes of the fed one of the worst things are going to happen is deflation because when you get deflation than the opposite of inflation happens what happens with inflation was inflation you're paying back your debt with\nDepreciated money and networks in your favor against your debt payment\nThat applies both to the interest and the principal with deflation you're paying back your debts and increasing cost because the value of your money is going down\n[noise] and so that increases the cost of your death [noise] you're the value of your money is critical in this case if you had the PlayStation [noise]\nYour debt to become more expensive and

we're going to Truckee, California Leanne welcome them when they talk\nAbout I appreciate your taking my call\nI had a question for you if I could and it has to do with model portfolio number three I have it through vanguard and I was looking after that they they had more money at the bond sight of that and it looks like I don't know if I'm allowed to many of the ... and that are not\nWell or one or two just asked me your your question a generic form\nOkay sounds good on one of them it looks like when I look it up last week at vanguard and I was looking at the year to date ill and so if I take that and ... kind of take it through the end it here and that was actually adjusted return it looks like I'd be better off going into the\nPrime money market rather than going into that and then the second part of that question was ... ... S C I F ... what ... what did that have to do with the annual return how does that relate\nWell they're all they're all love figure differently and uh so\nYou know if as long as you're consistent I think that's probably the most important part of it as long as you're consistent with how you're doing it but\nUh it depends which one you're looking at and ah it can be very complicated or known how these deals are constructed because you have current yield you have the maturity of as easy of distribution deal I mean it just goes on and on but I Would say as far as the money market fund component of that particular portfolio\nThe yield on that right now is over two percent\nAnd I think for someone that just wants to have a very very simplified portfolio as I've said before you can use that money market fund or you can use a C. D. ladder\nNow if you're going to use the CD ladder is an alternate or you could use for example equal amounts of the three six and nine and twelve month CD\nAnd by doing that you'd have a very short average duration you know our average duration in a portfolio is less than one year your average duration on a three six nine twelve months CGI would be even less than a than the one that's in the portfolio which is already over one year\nAnd that would be another way that you could look at it in other words there are various ways in a rising interest rate environment that you can go depends on how a wrist wrist tolerant you are if you're not risk tolerated at all\nThen to see the letter fully FDIC insured is risk free it's held the majority and that certainly is something to consider as well and that money market fund is also something to consider and we've\nIncluded that as part of the portfolio let's get out to the great cayenne us radio Denver lawn it is your turn ...\nFacts five as for as for the time I waited for your ...\nThank you for hold on I Do appreciate your patience thinking\nIf I have two daughters my a fourteen year old I Need to do a college five twenty nine plan for\nAnd I have a hundred thousand set aside for that I'd like to know what would make up for lost time what would be the highest return a college but I've heard I I Would recommend it then I have a twenty eight year old who she just finished her medical school and\nI'd like to I heard in the long term IRA find which would you prefer\nWell I think that uh for the twenty eight year old certainly getting started a I Would look at something or with broad diversification and low expenses\nI Would recommend or that you consider starting with something like either the or fidelity sport in total stock market index for the then go total stock market index they both have extremely low expense ratio is\nA minimal I Would consider the minimal not significant and they give you a broad diversification they give you tax efficiency so I think the total stock market index that either one of those out this would be a good place to start thank you\nThat's the only eight year old for the fourteen year old where it's a little dicey because you're going to be writing college tuition checks in about four years so you have to be a aware of that as well\nAnd so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio and by that I mean I Want to have some liquid assets some liquidity I mean in that portfolio\nOr at least by the time we get to the point where we're writing commissioned checked we can't make for your work and so in the market at least I Can't I don't have a four year forecast on the market\nUh so uh you know you have to consider is if you made a four year forecast on the market in Nineteen Ninety eight it probably would not have been they ask to be five hundred being an eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand\nSo making a four year for kids do more of the market's going to be is is a ... activity but uh certainly I think at this point you have some time here\nYou don't have to file you return to the next year but you may have to make estimated payments depending on how large numbers are that's between you and your accountant or your enrolled agent or a CPA but whatever I think bottom line here you might have some tax liability and I think if you do take three hundred and fifty out\nI think you will have some tax liability 'cause your money has a well more than doubled while you've added in there and by the way even taking the average cost in most of your cost is going to be based on your initial expense of approximately seven hundred thousand dollars\nSo I I wouldn't I Would ask you to go through all of that as far as the other a part of it going into the total market no I Would not do that\nOkay how are you mentioned short short duration bonds bond\nFund yeah yeah and you know if you don't want to if you don't want to do that there's a really simple way for you to do it you can do a a a letter of\nThe three six nine twelve months CDs equal amounts in that case you could spread it out roughly close to Ninety thousand and three months six months nine months twelve month when the three month comes through your role with into a twelve month that keeps your three six nine twelve sequence intact\nYou're fully FDIC insured when you do this I wouldn't do it any other way fully FDIC insured\nAnd uh that way you're not taking any risk with the money because you have FDIC behind you and because it's held the maturity you're guaranteed by the FDIC to get back your principal and interest uh as long as you're under the insured amount so that's the approach you could take\nNo I Would not be going out into some intermediate term duration bond fund because I I think that the\nUh I personally think it's not a good thing to be doing it this time I'm not doing it I'm not recommending it and that's why I Would rather be in the shorter to ration\nThis money talk [noise]\nMoney Chong [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them

everyone else with wise in interest rate and what is going to be doing to the bond\nA bond fund a and a oh you're going to be a return in additional fun too I guess as alternative to what you have in their portfolio or\nWell we really have presented three possibilities to to invest in depending on the tolerance for risk and I\nI mean we're we're always open to new ideas but frankly I think right now with the three options that we have I think we're in good shape well now we're dealing with this and either we're going to see a rise in\nIn the longer term rates or we're running an increasing risk of an inverted yield curve that that does not happen\nUh we're getting we're getting fairly close to a catch twenty two year\nWere either we have to see an increase in long term rates which many people don't want to see or we run the risk gift that keeps jacking up the federal funds rate that we could get into an area of an inverted yield curve down the road if the long rates uh don't appreciate\nSo it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out but it's going to take some time because right now there's a a decent gap\nBetween the federal funds rate and the ten year treasury rate but right now in addition to the portfolio that we publish\nOr in the investment his letter or a fixed income which as an average duration will Bush in one year\nIn addition to that we have two other avenues that we can go down depending on a personal preference\nOne I just mentioned that the caller is the um the CD ladder of the nice thing about the CD ladder is that uh you minimize your interest rate risk because you every three months you have a C. D. maturing to reinvest that the current rate\nAnd if you take a portfolio and you said it into four pieces three six nine twelve months CDs with FDIC coverage\nThan you're a you're rolling on that basis you don't have any credit risk because you have yet the icy and you don't have much interest rate risk at all because you're constantly every three months you're rolling into a new CD it prevailing rates\nAnd another area there's some people choose to go which is fine very convenient is something like that on guard prime money market you're getting your current your right now in excess of two percent or you can even get check writing with that\nYou have total It's Wednesday there and a check writing to go as well with the tricks of two fifty or more so plenty kind of a smorgasbord out there to try to avoid the risk of rising rates I don't see any point in going long term in the bond market at this juncture\nMore to come stay with us if you can buffer eager here it's the flight of the starship money [noise]\n\n[laughter] Sunday October ... what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the theory mood how Republicans might be ... you'll tracks with labor is why why we've\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people were bowlers fog Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\n\nShift so ...

gotten a lot of trouble and a wound up being bailed out in the end I'm\nWith the help the Federal Reserve and I'm with the help of the major bank um one of the things has always struck me is that uh I

H. O. radio in Des Moines Dan you're on the line with Adam go ahead\nYes I Am completely\nBeen amazed for a path basically one of the year two thousand and how powerful modern communication Finley crates\nDeflation or a pressure on pricing by price discovery I see it all the time on TV I see it all the time on on on social media Twitter Facebook\nAmazon these are all mechanisms that are driving the price of that act like they're stuck on the twentieth century they act like they don't know what the Internet really is when it comes to price perceptions election\nAnd are and how it the flights continuously while they can they scream inflation\nLike no they're they're more ours facing roof over his art got life pensions Hulu from their level so I I Can't believe nobody calls them out on it\n\nI got this was a this was the topic at the Jackson Hole meeting this year the the the deflation repression from the Internet economy is obviously very real of this is the incredible long upswing that we've had since two thousand nine to exaggerate\nIt will ... in many ways quite disappointing but what's really remarkable about is how little inflation repression there is in the system you see that on the wage side as well so\nI agree with you as being a qualitative shift in the world economy in the last Twenty years\nInternet is part of that story which are emphasizing but I also think you have to factor in this of course he's into connected with the into that story the role of the the Chinese economy is a great manufacturing hub which has systematically pressed\nThe cost of production down around the world so this is I think that changing the game in terms of monetary policy\nAnd yet professor there is a an intrinsic irony here that we would even for a moment the thinking gee I Wish there was more inflation\n[noise] yeah well that's that's true ... on the other hand deflation is a very bad thing from the point of view of the credit driven economy and we have to look at Japan to see how to build a tightening that can be if it really sets into the system\nI Will say from the point of view of handling you know an ever expanding volume of government debt\nIf you look back historically the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties when economies lied to us in the u._k. with dealing with the debts accumulates during World War two\nThey were paid back by very high levels of taxation they were paid by by high levels of growth but\nA key element in the story was also inflation running somewhat ahead of interest rates and that a is a sense of the attacks on money values or which helps to distribute the cost of paying for the war in that case paying for World War two\nAcross the entire population even though he's holding assets say managing and economies with structurally love inflation and in fact a tendency towards the ... is a really difficult thing to do and it's actually ... novel it's a new problem in Japan is not exactly a promising example of how things might go\nAgainst in is Adam Tuesday Columbia University whose new book is crashed we talk on the program um\nWe talk on the program at all about the fact that you will know that\nAre in a credit driven economy inflation is your friend in the sense that you're getting back your principal and appreciating dollars you're paying back your interest the depreciating dollars you know just ... just briefly could you help our listeners understand a\nWhy the place in in a credit driven economy is so painful in terms of what it does to Europe for example outstanding debt\nYeah I think the best way to look at this is the housing market I think that's where most of us understand this nice intimately and you take out a mortgage on the property at one of the basic questions you've got to ... when you\n\nGo up and almost all the details of done on the basis that at least the ... the house will retain its value will probably appreciate to some moderate or perhaps great extent if you're buying in San Francisco well Manhattan also my life that\nI mean and taught basis of a deal this was true will say for the subprime fails the full two thousand tonight is that you'll have a real price appreciation now you have the reverse is if you have a sudden price poll just the prospect of a long running sustained folding prices\nThat hits you'll equity and of course it does absolutely nothing to the debt that you owe the mortgage doesn't adjust downloads so in an upswing the price increase\nProvides a huge benefit to leverage to investors who has to take it out to mortgage with a small amounts of equity they gain all the profit from the appreciation the reverse happens when you guys with deflation situation\nI think insofar as the vast majority of people have most of the equity most of their assets most of their wealth in the real estate\nI don't miss the old and a very large part of that at least is leverage three mortgages to find yourself in the situation with prices falling is really a death now for\nFor households for ...\nYeah and then assemble model one hundred thousand dollar property where you put twenty thousand dollars down at that at that property declines in price by ten thousand you've lost heavier equity", "show_name": "Money Talk with Bob Brinker", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "14"}
