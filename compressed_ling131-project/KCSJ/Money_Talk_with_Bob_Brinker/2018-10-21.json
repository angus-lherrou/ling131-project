because after all knowledge is power a time in Scottsdale, Arizona hello there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a\nQuestion uh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have ah a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a ... a function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you ... you would do is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as the employment of people to support that to the questions or what have you\nYou know all of us all yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have some of them play so I just recently was approached by a company that said that they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function somehow that would work because they would give me dirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a prospective clients would ask and then those are three questions so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call in and they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she they had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I'd almost should include she looked at those dirty question\nYeah ... and say here's the reason why I'm hesitating with that is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my role hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office said you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building it for you\nAh yes well the the we do have a website it's already been built and we have another company building a another website all over again but but when we have a third tempting is calling me about that in the chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet\nI Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under FA cues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bought and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you

E. ratio most especially things like inflation expectations and interest rates\nSo when we take a look at the historical range of PE ratios as they would apply for example to the standard and Poor's five hundred index we see that over the very very long term the range has been quite wide\nFor example back in Nineteen Seventy four when the stock market was in the throes of a brutal bear market that lasted for close to two full years\nBecause the bear market back then that led to that very very low historical valuation figure started in January of Nineteen Seventy three in fact it started\nRight at the same time that the peace treaty was signed with North Vietnam bringing an end to the war in Vietnam so we're back to January Seventy three and the market right at the time the peace treaty is signed\nEditors bear market and by the end of Nineteen Seventy four nearly a full two years later like twenty three months later\nThe market finally reaches its final bottom in December of Nineteen Seventy four and the interesting thing about this is the valuation level on a price to earnings ratio basis that prevailed at the end of Nineteen Seventy four at the end of that brutal bear market\nThe ... the ratio was basically the lowest ever the market was trading and I speak of the S. and P. five hundred index here was trading basically at seven times earnings and so that was an extremely low level of valuation\nAnd then we have the polar opposite which is the record high level of evaluation for the U.S and the five hundred into action that occurred back in the early part of the new millennium in fact it occurred in January two thousand\nAnd January two thousand\nThe ah to march of two thousand call it the first quarter of year two thousand\nWe saw the price to earnings ratio on the standard and Poor's five hundred index escalate to a record high which was basically thirty times earnings think about this now in December of Nineteen Seventy four at the bottom of the massive bear market that lasted almost two years\nWe had a valuation of seven times earnings on a price to earnings ratio bases\nWell look at that extreme and the first quarter of two thousand when you had that level up to basically thirty times earnings that is more than four times greater\nThan the low evaluation that prevailed\nAt the bottom of the Nineteen Seventy three Nineteen Seventy four bear market\nSo there we have a range including the extremes of the range so we can mark down okay\nWe have a say you're seven and December Seventy four basically that's his lowest it's been historically this is for the U.S and the five hundred index and then we have the figure of thirty in the first quarter of year two thousand\nAnd that's the highest it's been\nFor the U.S and the five hundred index so we could call that the total range including the extreme low in the extreme high\nThen we have a range of normalcy and the range of normalcy would be in the mid to on occasion the upper teens\nCertainly a range of normalcy would be in the Fifteen to sixteen times earnings range however\nDuring extended bull markets you can see a slightly higher range of normalcy which can reach as high as Seventeen to Eighteen times earnings now\nThis gives you an idea of what to expect most of the time\nMost of the time you're going to have a price earnings ratio is going to be from the mid to the upper teens something in the general area of Fifteen times earnings\nRanging up to something in the general area of Eighteen times earnings and that is how you can determine what the valuation of the market is relative to its historical record\nObviously inflation is very important here because the higher the rate of inflation than ah the um the last\nUh integrity is given to future earnings because the future earnings are degraded because of inflation because of the degradation of buying power that results due to inflation\nObviously in a low inflation inflation environment or that is good for a price to earnings ratios because those future earnings are worth more when inflation rates are low\nI bought Brinker this money's talk [noise]\nMoney Chong

hello but\nHey how're you doing today Bob\nThanks ... what's up\n[noise] hey I Would just like to get your uh advice or my wife and myself with both like to take Social Security at age sixty two and just to see what your opinion would be taking it then early because\nMost people would like us to work to sixty five or sixty seven\nWell that's your decision but uh as long as you aware are aware of what you're living on the table potentially in a lot of this has to do with life expectancy\nAnd you know if you're a heavy smoker you don't expect to be around long anyway is sixty two is fine but uh keep in mind that you are living on the table if you expect longevity\nYou are living on the table above than eight percent increase annually and your Social Security benefit by delaying each year\nRight when we get to I think we'll be at that critical mass by sixty two we're going to have almost a million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved and I do and we are eligible for both pages from the state of Florida\nAnd with our pensions and everything else we're looking at about making about eighty eight thousand dollars a year in income at that time in our life\nNow does that eighty eight thousand include the early taking of Social Security\nYes\nOkay so is that enough for you to be a way to meet your standard of living are to be a net saver or what does what does eighty eight thousand do for you\nWell it's ah almost what we make now okay here early um are at my pension is three will be three thousand a year plus\nAlmost two and a half percent increase for the rest of my life\nA Social Security be about sixteen hundred and she'll be able to work till she's age sixty five plus draw Social Security because she doesn't make that much money at the school districts you were working you know\nHere's my answer Bob and and I want you to think about it I Would ... you fill out the blanks but I Would not take the Social Security any earlier than you have to take it and I'm going to tell you why\nBecause every year you're delaying it goes up about eight percent an annual income value therefore I Would take the Social Security only when you need the money\nOkay All right thanks for your ah opinion on that appreciate it\nBob thank you for calling let's get Patricia on the line in a Chicago hello Patricia\nHi I'm In a subscriber and I'm enjoying today's much thank

on Monday talk thank you for joining us\nAnd certainly on our broadcast over the years we have discussed some some some critical factors that you can incorporate into your investment management to help you along the way and we've talked in detail about a number of these not the least of which is diversification\nWhere you are diversifying your portfolio money over a many different investments not putting all of your eggs in one basket and we've talked in detail and you know it's something that's come up and that is the issue of how much money you put it in any one stock how many times can you recall\nThat people have called into the broadcast investors have called in and said well you know I have all my money in the stock or most of my money or whatever\nAnd it's just not good investments sense to do that because what you do when you concentrate your investments in one stock did you expose yourself to something that is known as specific company risk\nAnd specific company risk is a big deal if you focus on just one company\nIf something goes wrong with the business model or in some other way something goes wrong with your company like Enron for example than the money's gone and that's the reason that we have talked so many years about our four percent guideline\nAnd our four percent guideline is basically an offshoot of modern portfolio theory that's all it is and in modern portfolio theory it has been documented that if you own twenty five stocks\nA lot different than all your money in one or two stocks if you own twenty five stocks with an application of about four percent or a full portfolio as soon as you're doing your own stock picking if you owned twenty five stocks\nAcross many different industries not twenty five drugs stocks not twenty five tech stocks only five stocks across many different industries\nThat what you can do in that portfolio is you can achieve a level of diversification\nThat will avoid this problem of all my wanting in money and wants to all my money in one industry group and that is really a very very strong tenet of investment management that idea of diversification and then there's asset allocation especially\nSomeone that's approaching or in their retirement years\nAsset allocation makes so much sense where they're going to adopt a balanced investment portfolio or they're going to have a portion of their portfolio allocated to the stock market\nAnd that includes a portion of that in the international community stock market and then they're going to have a portion of their investment portfolio in the fixed income area\nAnd there are many different ways to invest in fixed income securities and many of those are government guaranteed like FDIC insured CDs or treasury instruments\nSo asset allocation is another of the key tenets of investment management keeping expenses as low as something we've talked about on this broadcast for more than a quarter century because when you keep those expenses low on your portfolio\nThat means that there's more money going into your pocket and less money going into an advisors pocket and that's good because you wind up with more money at the end of the day\nAnd so keeping expenses down is a big deal and you know a good part of that can be done by incorporating something we've talked about and that's including index funds in your portfolio index funds might be the total stock market index that might be the S. and P. five hundred they might be the um\nThat they might be the Russell three thousand but index funds can go a long way to doing two things virtually keeping your expenses down which is great and secondly guaranteeing you you're not going to under perform you cannot under perform [noise] on the index portion of a

are back on America's money program and we thank you for joining us is great to have you with us John is on the line in San Ramon John and does your turn welcome\nTo find out during the increase in the national debt as a result of the tax bill\nOr if you believe that there will be an inability of the United states to cover it short term I'm borrowing needs and or whether or not if you do agree that the United states faces or a bankruptcy and the next twelve much\nI don't think we have a bankruptcy and the next twelve months John but I I have to tell you that there was nobody in Washington with any power\nThat I'm aware of that cares at all about the national deficit or the national debt the annual deficit or the national debt\nIt seems as though the whole topic of the national debt in the annual deficit has completely vanished from the radar screen I'm not hearing anybody in Washington DC\nIn a position of power talking about the topic is vanished\nGot the debt to Dennis Dennis ... advantage what\nDo you have a concern over the uh the short term that we could face a some financial issues because of our ah inability to to borrow the money necessary to cover our short term debt even if it's not\nAnd they don't know well ah for the next ... months I can speak clearly I Do not have a concern because I think that uh there are enough people out there willing to\nTrust the full faith and credit and taxing power of the usa to buy our bonds they may demand more interest going forward\nWouldn't be surprised at all going forward if they are demanding more interest for the debt but I think there are buyers out there for the debt and for the next ... months I've no question\nThat there are buyers for the debt at the prevailing right at that time whatever it might be\nAppreciate the call John thank you\n\nJane in Illinois Welcome to talk\nYeah thank you I I Want to get your opinion on that robo advisers\nWell what opinion would you like what's your question\nWell how would you compare that to say are pretty here a rolling over ... della tea or are they in art\nWell of course I'm as you know vanguard has a a a low cost advisory service I knew cost something in the area of\nThirty five basis points which is close to one third of one percent a year look I think if a person is is out at sea without orders and they have no idea what they're doing I think they're way better off\nWith a service like that then making a lot of mistakes\nWhen I'll a with a robo adviser you are saying well\nThe one that I described yes I think that if somebody has available to them something like that at a low cost\nAnd is going to provide them with some guidance as opposed to being out there and having an absolutely no idea in the world what they're doing\nThat's a recipe for disaster so I think in a case like that uh it it makes sense to me\nThank you for the call\nMoney talks comes your way each and every weekend as we talk about subjects financial Steve's on the line in Nebraska Steve welcome to money too\nI have a question about my for all three be at work I'm sixty years old and I could find the involved in keeping the four or three maybe that was just wondering if I convert that over to an IRA can I um [noise]\nOr they're less attribute it to an IRA compared for three be\nWell what kind of fees are you experience\nUm well [noise] something that my uh [noise] I I kinda try to take your advice like with your opening monologue with uh doing most of my work myself and not\nA trying to utilize it to save save money on those have well it turns out that he's charging me these anyway and and that\nI don't appreciate that especially when they kind of told me that they weren't going to charge he said\nWell here's the deal if you if you roll your if you're eligible to roll your account or into something like a a a self directed IRA at a place like a band guard or if it's done with the\nUm I think you will find that a especially if you're using index funds which have very low expense ratio is I think you'll find it very inexpensive\n\nNow here's here's the question do you need to ask you need to find out whether you're still eligible to contribute to for all three baby if you do that\nUm as far as I can determine I Am I don't I don't want to stop for all three\nNow so you want to confirm that with your only confirmed that with your HR\nYeah yes or a very important yes thank you Bob\nNow this is very very important that if you make a decision to make a change in your four oh one K. for all three be whatever like that where you're going to do a roll over\nThe national debt is now we're ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops into the dollars value some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven [noise]\nIs money talks [noise]\nGreat to have you with us here in America is money program muddy talked\nThis is the program that works with you to help you learn how to become your own personal financial manager gets you out of the way of the shark attacks\nSo you can take charge of your financial future and your family's financial future as well we talk about everything here from investing in your four O. one K. or for oh three B to saving for all of those important future goals education for the young sprouts\nOur view is that you can get that job done by acquiring the\nKnowledge the knowledge that empowers you to control your financial future and\nUm you can do some really good forward planning and one of the things you might want to do is take advantage of some of those tax privileged accounts that are out there\nAre lots of opportunities out there you have the opportunity to put money aside in your um your IRA program whether it'd be the traditional i._r._a. or the Roth IRA\nThat's five thousand five hundred dollars for those under the age of fifty and six thousand five hundred dollars for those age fifty or more even if you have a non working spouse you\nCan open an IRA for the non working spouse as long as it's funded by you're running and has to be covered by earned income earned income so that's another opportunity to put money aside you can make a fully deductibles traditional i._r._a. contribution to qualify\nAnd um\nThat's another way to get money working for the future now that way you get a duck should\nYou get a fully deductible contribution to a tradition liar way is qualified but you can also do a real diary if you prefer if you qualify for that program the amounts are the same fifty five hundred for those under fifty sixty five hundred for fifty plus\nAnd do our income\nThresholds for Roth IRA eligibility\nAnd these are all terrific ways outstanding ways for you to put money away for the future whether it'd be in the traditional higher rate the Roth IRA re the most important thing of all is that you take advantage to the max that you can afford\nAnd the other most important thing of all is to absolutely take advantage and at a minimal\nTake advantage of the full matching provision if you have a matching provision to so many companies do in a four O. one K. some for three days this is the definition of free money if anybody ever asked you what is there such a thing as free money the hazards yes\nAnd free money is represented by the matching contribution that your company will give you\nIn a four O. one K. or similar type plant because if you meet the minimum standard let's say they say well we'll give you three percent if you put in six will match half of your contribution\nUp to six percent so you put insects they add three\nNine goes in nine percent goes in of your salary and yes that three percent the company is throwing in there that is the definition of free money that is like a raise that the company is offering you but you have to be smart enough to take it\nBy at least reaching the minimal\nContribution standard\nThat you would have to make but that's a great way for you to put money aside as well\nThis is a great\nTime for you to maximize your charitable giving uh my favorite charity as the U.S funds for UNICEF which does great work for children around the world\nI Would also point out that there is a terrific provision in the tax law which is now a permanent law\nThat you can give to your favorite charities directly from your IRA this has to be done directly from your custodian to the charity or or charities of your choice so you don't handle the money you direct your custodian to make the gift or gifts\nNow in the case of an individual you're allowed to give up to one hundred thousand dollars a year\nTo your favorite charities directly from your custodian to the charities from your IRA and if you do that as part of your required minimum distribution you don't have to pay income tax on that money up to a hundred thousand\nAnd some of you I Know one person has an IRA and the spouse has an area where you can both do it\nUp to a hundred thousand each on an annual basis your favorite charities instructor your custodian\nTo make those gifts you may have been planning to make 'em anyway it'll give cash give orange day money because you're not going to have to pay income tax\nOn this money that had to come out of the IRA anyway as part if you had it as part of a required minimum distribution so there's no reason to pay more than you have to pay\nThis is especially true sense if you're deducting charitable contributions you know if you're a high earner that they do take away your deductions as your income increases\nFor those of you would like information on my market timer investment letters easily done this at our website at Bob Brinker dot com you can click on the request they complimentary issue

Fox is Brett Baer there seems to be a rush to judgment\nYour insurance future\nSo many other things that are keys we've talked about saving a minimum if you can afford to do so a minimum of ten percent of your income\nBecause that's the money that you're going to invest in your um IRA or your four one K. or your four oh three baby or tax privilege to count whatever it may be\nAnd that's the money that over time can compound and grow for you until you reach retirement age level now\nI liked the idea of putting more than ... percent frankly if you can afford to put a Fifteen Percent or twenty percent more power to you\nBecause that will obviously accumulate better but\nAt a minimum level if you can afford to do so I Would establish ten percent as that minimum now another topic that we've talked about that so critical is paying those credit cards off on a monthly basis because you accomplished two things\nWhen you pay your credit cards off on a monthly basis number one you don't accumulate some massive usually high interest\nRate debt that you really don't want as part of your future financial picture you don't do that when you pay them all monthly but the second thing that happens is it works as a discipline on avoiding excessive spending\nBecause if you cannot afford to pay it off on a monthly basis then all you're doing is piling up debt something that I Know many of you may not want to do\nAnother thing that I think is important and you know when you listen to the money talks colors you hear that a lot of people have some work to do on this one and that is when you're approaching or in your retirement years\nYou really want to think about a balanced investment portfolio now a balanced investment portfolio edits basic form\nAs a fifty percent allegations of the stock market and the fifty percent allocation to income producing securities\nAnd the whole idea about using a balanced portfolio approaching or in your retirement years is to manage your risk\nYou don't want to be taking a lot of risk when you're at that point in the investment cycle and the way for you to modify that risk control that risk managed it if you will is by adopting a balanced investment portfolio\nThat contains an equal amount or close to an equal amount in stock market investments highly diversified of course\nAnd an income producing security's so that's a thought that I think is that the core of investing which is the adoption of a balanced investment portfolio approach approaching or in your retirement years\nAnd these are are some of the key things that I think that you can do to make a difference\nI'm Bob Brinker this Monday talk [noise]\nMoney John [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] no\nMatter how modern your family might be here paddling around

there I'm I'm I'm about two years from retirement and as I uh moved from portfolio one\nInto portfolio three\nI'm following the four percent rule which I've learned on your show and I appreciate uh\nHow do you go about harvesting that four percent when you're diversify\nBetween the index funds from the bond funds um so you have like one check coming in a ... at the end of the month\nWell what I Would do a certainly it would be a lot easier if you had these are assets assembled at one custodians at the case\n[noise] uh I'm not an portfolio three now I'm I'm In portfolio one [noise] and um\nWell congratulations you've uh definitely definitely done extremely well\nYeah we're we're getting close for getting really close um they they the the friend that I stumbled upon it at vanguard was the vanguard managed payout fun and it's they would control the money in their portfolio and automatically send you one check at four percent and it's a man that well\nThat's that's what I was that's what I was getting it okay 'cause that would mean that would mean without commenting on that particular fund that would mean you ... you have a single custodian so here's the way\nLet me use model portfolio three sets the portfolio you were asking about yeah let me use use that and that's the portfolio the most commonly\nOur subscribers used for purposes of using the four percent withdraw

America worldwide on the Web is America's money program money talk I think that\nThose who live in the high tech states are going to have to fess up to reality I'm not saying they're going to like it but I think reality is this is a guy to moment this is a gotcha moment where the federal government has passed a law and they got you\nAnd if you have the ... on state and local taxes of all kinds of nexus of ten thousand dollars they got you\nI don't expect anybody in that position to like it but I Do expect them to do the obvious which is seriously look at relocation it doesn't have to be that way there are places all over the country some of which have no have no state income taxes\nNow what is that going to do that's going to take away from the high earner population because those are the people that would have the um the motive\nTo make a change and\nThere are still many places around the country where you can make a change\nI mean look at the situation between Oregon and Washington Oregon a high state income tax Washington zero Washington state uh uh there were other states places around the country where the same thing is true\nAnd a look at look at the state like Texas surrounded by states with relatively high state income taxes are states like Oklahoma for example\nWell there you go Texas is not that far from Oklahoma and there are examples like this all over the country look at the difference between North Dakota and South Dakota I Know not many people are there but some of them are there and listen to money talk\nIn places like Fargo in Sioux Falls and others and I can tell you right now\nThere's a big difference in state income tax between North Dakota and South Dakota because South Dakota doesn't have any\nSo you have this situation all over the country Georgia and Florida very very good example high state income tax no state income tax this is a situation all over the country people are going to look at this now because this can be really big money for a high earner\nAnd so people can look at this and say\nJust makes a big difference so these are the kinds of considerations that people will continue\nTo make and it's just logic it's basic logic to expect people to ignore this would be to expect ... suspect people not to care about their money will people do care about their money Clark is on the line in Baton Rouge although clerk\nYeah hello\nThanks for taking my call itself a been retired since June of ah twenty eleven and a half kept the majority of a bond funds that stable value on over that time frame it goes a low interest rates and\nIt's worked out pretty good but it looks like me\nIt's time to be changed by strategy and start move it into your low duration income funds 'cause I've been doing that with some of my money for a couple of years ago I noticed that ah I'm making about twice as much as a stable by you\nAnd a cat or the that go to a that's going to improve over time going forward [noise] and so I just wanted to get a second opinion mute does it make sense maybe start doing that\nShift now that it should have your stable normalize what is your stable value of thing you\nIt's paying me right at the last ... last year it was to herself and they're all a rated phones are contracts\nAnd you have no risk your principal at all\nVery very little yeah\n... ... it's a very tough it's a very tough question to answer and I'll tell you why [noise] uh\nIt's very difficult to know going forward what the rates of return are going to be because of the propensity of interest rates to reflect what's going on in the economy and thereby for the fed to reflect what's going on in the economy with reference to interest rate in monetary policy so it's a it's a very very tough call\nTo make a for recall on what the income portfolio is going to earn and but it's very difficult to make that kind of a projection versus what you seem to be saying is a guarantee two percent [noise] yeah\nAnd it and it it would it at the beginning of my retirement\nIt was much better than that it was around four in there but yeah as these contracts mature you know they lack the interest rates going down and so you know the return of slowly degraded in one day when they start to normalize and go back up the same thing's going to happen and I got to go up very fast\nAnd you have a point in time I got to figure out what I make switch and\nWell I mean maybe that maybe there will be a time clerk when you can make that kind of a judgment but my response to your question right now is it's a very very tough comparison to make based on what we know right now and I do appreciate the call\nThis was money talk [noise]\nMoney John [noise]\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you
