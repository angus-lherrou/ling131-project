important to teach your kids what to do is they find a firearm\nWhether it's real or not they should always apply to simple rules stop don't touch go away and telling adult number firearm injuries are one of the top ten causes an accident related deaths in children\n\nYou're investing in in in the case of a lot of these accounts by the way you can invest off the top before taxes for maximum earnings value that way you defer the taxation all the way out to your retirement years\nSo you're accumulating your wealth in baby steps in order to get rich slowly\nAnd that's the way to do it in my opinion now\nThere are other types of accounts like Ross IRAs where you don't get that tax you don't get a money taken off the top you're putting after tax money into a raw diet re the benefit is as long as you follow the rules the score and you're going to grow tax free for you you don't have to pay taxes on it when you take it out\nBut either way the whole idea is the same idea to take at least ten percent of what you're making and put it into these types of accounts\n\nWe've talked also on the program about maximizing your tax deferred investments\nThat means you're four one K. for all three be for the sevens your IRAs all of these programs these tax privilege to uh programs are great way for you to build wealth over time all the way out to you're going to take it out way down the road\nSo that's another very important part of managing your money and building up toward reaching critical mass\nAlso very important to understand the difference between asked us an income because really over the long term it's the assets that will make the difference in your life now the income as the vehicle\nThat allows you to acquire assets and your net worth over your lifetime\nBut income can be fleeting\nA person can be making an excellent income something happens to them and then they can't do it anymore well there goes the income\nLook at these uh professional athletes we read about these players these professional athletes athletes a lot has been said about the athletes in the NFL\nWhere they'll make a huge amount of money over a short period of time and then unfortunately many of them have filed bankruptcy within ... years of retirement from they're relatively short careers\nAssets versus income very important to never be confused on that point never to misunderstand the words because income is here while you're earning it and that is wonderful but it's not the same as assets as such can be used\nTo generate income for the rest of your life that's a big deal\nThat's critical mass when you put together the asset based including our tax privileged accounts that will provide for you the ability\nTo earn income and interest income in the form of interest and also dividends for the rest of your life that the value of assets and that's the contribution to the assets make in reaching the land a critical mass\nAnd we're we've also talked about managing your money from the top down yes you'll have these different accounts but you also have the ability to manage your money from the top down so that you can make judgments about things like diversification\nThings like asset allocation\nVery very important to be able to do that and the top down management approach which is the one we like to think about here on Monday talk\nMoney John [noise]\nIf you or someone

a question I just started taking your market timer newsletter and I'm looking through there and I see it represents something called current investment income and\nPortfolio won that you are having an example in the back\nHas almost no current investment income but portfolio three is heavy and current investment income so my question is I have a traditional R rated I Want to supplement my\nRetirement income with a pension and Social Security and my question is if I were to move into the court or we'll read it provides a lot of current investment income or someone like yours to recommend something like that to me\nHow do I get my hands on the current investment income or those just dividends an interest that I've received somehow without selling shares of my other re\nWell you're absolutely right bill that model portfolio one which is an aggressive growth portfolio has a it's really not um designed to generate current income is designed to generate growth\nAnd ah it certainly has done that uh if you look at the performance table or you will see that over the long term those portfolios have or don't extremely well\nNow model three would be a portfolio the balanced

answer to your question or is this personal money or is this tax privilege money that you're talking about\nPersonal money in a traditional Ira\nVersus money and oh it's ... it's it's in it but it's in an IRA\nCorrect are so all the money that comes out of there is coming out as ordinary income you understand the correct it will be taxed when I take it out\nIt'll be taxed at will be tax that ordinary income all of the money\nRight you'd take out of your traditional i._r._a. when you take it out and only when you take it out it's going to be taxed as ordinary income it will be subject to federal tax and also it will be subject to the Illinois state I Believe you have a flat tax in Illinois correct\nA traditional higher re monies are exempt in Illinois whoa\nHouse it is a ... I don't think everybody's I don't think everybody's gonna moved Illinois over that but hey All right and I think what we can get will take what we can get right that's correct hair ... here's the deal well that's good news so here's the deal then you just have to pay the federal freight on that\nAnd here's the answer to your question a you decide what you're going to withdraw from that account and anything that you withdraw\nYour beyond fifty nine and a half I presume right Oh yes uh-huh yes\nSo anything that you withdraw is coming out as ordinary income but in your case only at the federal rate because of you are say tax exemption law on IRA income which is a great law certainly support the law\nAnd uh what that means is that the dividends that are earned on your stocks in your mutual funds in a portfolio three you're interested is earned on those\nBond funds in a portfolio all of that comes into the portfolio in your tradition liar re but it can only come out as ordinary income so\nYour accumulating that in there and you're either putting your money fund in anticipation of withdrawing it or you're re investing it one of the other but from the standpoint of um\nWhat's going to happen to it\nIt's going to ... ... it's it either way it's going to stay in the traditional i._r._a. portfolio until you take it out as ordinary income do you have a plan to take money out\nI Am working on a plan now but what you just said they're to me it it can go into them money fund or be reinvest it currently I have checked for it to be reinvest it are you saying that I can\nAnd I have a money fund set up I can have a direct it to the money fund and from there than I can draw without selling any of my shares and get my supplemental income is that correct\nWho's your custodian vanguard\nI think that you can set it up then you can talk to them but I think you can set it up where you can have your account\nCoated they will code you recount\nWhere the money that comes in in interest from interest bearing and dividends from dividend paying all of that money would be directly\nPlaced into a the the vanguard prime money market I Would recommend the vanguard prime money market the symbol is um is a Victor\nA em em\nEh sex that would be Victor Amazon money ... money Sierra X ray and would you be able to do is you direct all of the money coming in that way into the money markets so that it would be available\nIn liquid form for any withdrawals that you make now I Would only do this if you're planning on making withdrawals out of that account now remember any any withdrawals that you make\nI have to wait by calling your addiction team you're taking the first steps to recovery to help you need to be one call away eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the\nFree call now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight your addiction teams are third party advertiser for various treatment centers and play some networks individual results will bury visit your addiction team dot com forward slash turns for more information for radio\nWhen kids are really fun I'm ... and ... and I'm putting your money when American your children's miracle and then when\nThey do seven this is John Green and if your teeth\nAre staying from coffee tea or smoking powered swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shades even better there is no messy strip search trees that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just swap you're cheap for five minutes and you're done to try power swabs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine you're bright white smile will have your friends\nTalking about how great you look try at risk free\nOne eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nThat's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nAttention all authors page publishing as looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published\nPage publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright and editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author so they should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\n[noise]\nIs money to [noise]\nFor the beaches of Waikiki to the shores of luck on a sound as America's Monday program\nMoney you talk about Brinker here thank you for joining us great to have you with us Ken welcome to money talk\nBob how're ya doing well what's up a\nQuick question for you I'm fifty three years old with a one point nine million network I currently have one point five million in my four oh one K. retirement\nAnd I'm currently at Seventy five twenty five but I'm look I'm actually thinking about going ...

on your mind today\nOh thanks for taking this call I'm a longtime subscriber in a long time listener and my question is about a pensions I'm a uh I'm fifty six and a half and eligible to receive a pension payment or her time in\nService when I hit sixty and I intend to take that\nAnd are they call and our benefits they said that a pension is ah backed up by the pension benefit guarantee corporation like pensions going to be about thirty four hundred a month\nAnd uh that are looking up information on the uh looks like\nA for payments for twenty Eighteen on those are guaranteed for about thirty five hundred a month and benefits said they're guaranteed perhaps about five thousand a month I question for you is that I have anything to worry about as far as that uh income stream that portion of my income income stream and retirement\n[noise]\nWell uh it would seem to me that any pension that you have earned would be dependent on their ability to meet their pension obligations is that makes sense do you\nMake sense to me and I was at stand right now\nYou know they've they've been under stress their attention a obligations are underfunded but um [noise] that from what I understood that\nAre that the pension benefit guarantee corpus somewhat of an analogous to FDIC insurance that\nAh it's paid for by companies that participate and you're not if you have a ... a large pension or let's say whatever eighty grant or something like that it that that's not going to be covered but after a certain amount the architect Cabot am I Am I correct in that or am I mistaken\nI Would say this that I'm thirty four hundred dollars a month that's an annual pension of over forty thousand dollars a year\nSo what I what I Would check would be what the limits or on the pension benefit guarantee corporation payouts relative to what you are expecting because I mean that's what's going to determine if\nAnd if this thing winds up in the hands of a\nPension benefit guarantee then the question is will you get all or most of what you were expecting so I Would inquire at pension benefit guarantee to see what their limits are and and how that would compare to your situation\n[noise] yeah this uh this money\nAt age sixty ... it would be a about like maybe thirty five percent of my income stream that I counted on at sixty so I mean I had uh my uh four one K. and my IRA money is and basically it expands I at the desk that I can with your\nChoice as a model Europe your act to pass at portfolio\nIn my own personal investments are but I mean this this uh this money would come in handy you know and and I I just want to see if it's something that I have to have the plan on and like you said I Will look up look up the government website and look up pension benefit guarantee and yeah and and\nSee what the details or yeah that's what I Would do but I mean I my guess would be the worst case\nAnd this is only a guess but worst case which seemed to me you'd be likely to get a even with pension benefit guarantee you'd be likely to get a really good chunk of that pension income worst case\nThat that sort of kinda sounded like it kinda sounded like from the tables the information that I looked up yeah\nAnd that for you know on and I'm looking to be paid that I'd be pretty much covered and find out what it sounds like it was good that is a pension benefit guarantee is somewhat of an ally gets to a FDIC insurance\nWell I think there are I don't like that can uh let me tell you why I don't like that comparison nobody's ever lost the nickel\nNobody's ever lost a nickel in a in a fully insured balance by the FDIC All right they have a perfect record of paying off everybody with uninsured amount up to the insurance limit\nAnd I and I think that that's what makes your situation different because in the case of pension benefit guarantee you there are a lot of people who have only received a portion of their pension because their pension that they earned was greater than what pension benefit guarantee pays out so that's the difference\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on a ...\nI Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay a\nOkay you've answered my question\nTo Rob appreciate the call great to hear from Lincoln\nI knew someone

T. M. F.\nExchange traded mutual funds and that's the third category now the really big difference between open and funds\nThat are no load overload funds and exchange traded funds is the fact that exchange traded mutual funds E. T. apps trade during the day\nBut of course they share that trait in common with the other category closed and mutual funds closed and mutual funds are generally listed on an exchange and trade during the day so some people mistakenly think that the only types of\nMutual funds that trade during the day or exchange traded mutual funds frequently referred to as ... not true\nAnother entire class of mutual funds the closed end mutual funds also trade during the day the only class of mutual funds that is priced to ... only on the clothes\nThat would be the open and mutual funds now as we mentioned within the context of the open and mutual funds you have two categories you have the know load open and mutual funds\nAnd then you have the loaded open and mutual funds\nNow if you're a money talk regular you already know\nI have always concentrated on the no load open ended mutual funds because you don't pay a sales commission\nTo purchase or redeem the shares why should you there's no reason when there are thousands upon thousands of no load open and mutual funds no reason at all\nTo pay a commission to buy or redeem shares in a mutual fund so that's the opening category in the know load area and then you have the load area\nWhich can charge you five six percent or more just to buy the shares or just to redeem the shares hey that's your money going down the drain\nI don't recommend that of course of action ever\nThen of course we have the closed and mutual funds the thing you want to be aware of with the closed and mutual funds which can trade at a discount or a premium to the net as that value\nYou want to remember that if you are looking at an initial public offering there's usually about five percent commission\nPriced into the offering price now what does that mean that means that if you buy a closed and mutual fund\nThe initial public offering at twenty five dollars a share there's probably about it\nTwenty five and commission in that price what does that mean to you that means that you get the shaft because the twenty five dollars that you paid for that initial public offering closed and share actually has a net as a value on day one\nOf just twenty three dollars and Seventy five cents if it has a five percent embedded commission which is very common place and the closed and marketplace\nThat's why there's really no reason as a general rule to be buying a closed and mutual fund on an I. P. O. Y. so that you get the privilege of paying a five percent or so commission\nWell that's no prevalence at all some people would look upon that more as a rip off so with a closed in funds once you get that now that said value at a\nAt the same price as the share price then you have parity frequently you'll see discounts in a closed and mutual fund because the price of the shares is completely dependent on supply and demand in the marketplace cause they trade like stuck\nAnd so it's quite common for a closed and mutual fund to trade at a discount sometimes they'll trade it a premium in either case the net assets value is what it is underlying shares\nAnd that brings us back to that third category which is the more recent a category and that's the exchange traded mutual fund so anytime you your E.
