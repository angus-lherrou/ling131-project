we face are still that's coming up as the program on falls back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd they have an episode codified is exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the

America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I\nThought [noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in that rise ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles and our founding documents they accept none of

everything that we are up against the abs since ... presumption of innocence Kavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\n\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThat and that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThose crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not
