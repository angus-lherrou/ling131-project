Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's past here's Rachael Sutherland judge Kavanaugh\nIt was asking their senior politics writer Harry end in about CNN polls on various Senate races that are within or close to the margin of error to question polls are tightening out there\nKnow the question was\n[laughter] oh no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God no well what what does that tell you what what [noise]\nWhat what what's going on Harry ...\nAre so many racist that are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada\nTennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a ... at the met about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wonder how far can wave in the Senate in the house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means that impeachment of the Democrats get the house and don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake loans in there because they would never vote to ah to convict\nIf the Republicans hold the Senate or even while the ranks so the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nShe says there was discussion of a blue wave being generic battled advantage for Democrats the you'll notice that tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm going to get a little aside observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the\nDemocrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage of the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them the Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time said it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have and will fund we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friends leave that's why you Drew's on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term so Kate layer about somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices paper resumes\nThat much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds have the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've\nMade players do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you were doing you were making beds you've earned guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time or third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here polls in January\nIn front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media\nWhich is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could have been answered none zilch zero not up [noise]\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in my house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out now all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final current and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't want anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen I Am the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat protects you to mind went viral and Dr buys loved it they love\nIt when the leader of the G O P in their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting in all over the world\n\nNotice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just being thanked opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all of this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that really find them up that will fire

and their expertise this kind of thing these kinds of trade deals and promoting globalism gigantic world structure a world order that McCain often spoke about this is why they are in there\nAnd it's gone\nFar I'm telling you foreign policy wonks is not getting any coverage is cabinets morphing everything but I'm here to tell you that all these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die by such things as NAFTA\nAre beside themselves that Trump got this done [noise] it is a huge middle finger to them\n\nHow to build burden is just trade Limbaugh British show talking about training on Kevin Kevin O's not inspiring anybody how can anybody listen this program I think\nThat creating NAFTA took these people years Trump guts it\nKeep replaces it in ... and do an insult to injury that Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it they ask me part of it are noses or not out of joint they're not crying and moaning about them also NAFTA they want in on this new Trump deal and that is also\nProfoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers they can't see straight this is just more hatred for Trump this is just it's blinding them\nAnd now there isn't a companion story didn't have a chance to get through it yesterday the child comes\nAre getting ready to lower their trade barriers on us exports because of Trump's tariffs it's all working\nThis is something these guys never even tried to do\nTo straighten out the trade imbalance with the child comes the swamp rollers never even tried to do that that was just\nAnother circumstance we had to accept in the modern world and watch what's going to happen next I'll tell you right here and now Iran is going to come to the table you watch when that happens\nThis is all falling into place for Trump exactly as he said exactly as he is making\nHappen\nI don't know how many do you do wire transfer is but there is a form of wire transfer called swift and if you're goes ahead and puts on a replacement for swept Trump is liable to freeze the Iranians out of using it meaning it have trouble moving their money around\n[noise] that's why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal\nIn so many ways it's a huge deal in turning the swamp upside down on the inside out and it is a huge deal for Trump making America great again putting America First and following through on a deeply deeply committed in highly touted campaign promise trade deals were among Trump's top\nThree campaign issues\nIt's not an accident that Ninety thousand people tried to get into the trumpet Johnson City Tennessee Johnson City Tennessee after the NAFTA deal is done ... ... ... ... that the people in Washington the drive by media are totally missing this it's not sexy told them it ... it's not a big deal NAFTA trade deal yeah\nScrewed Trump for doing it but they they don't have any ability to see its connection and its relevance and its importance in Trump supporters remaining ramped up and loyal and then there's this one more song by\nFeaturing your host CNN this happened and just before the conclusion of the previous hour I said ten minutes to one CNN aired this\nThere are some Republicans who say they have it all went down if he was defeated or the fourth or with raw that that would just jammed up Republican turnout because the quarter is there a holy grail and they would come rushing out his Rush Limbaugh saying don't bet on it\nIt's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they never voted before\nBut his that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in because if that happens take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed in the Senate you think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say\nYou see what happened to Kevin all wearing the majority that we couldn't get to confine you need to come out in ...\nHow does that work how does that work pretty good point I Do think that that's an important point that if Kavanaugh goes down and it'll be because moderate Republicans decided not to vote for him and that could depressed turn out in some ways that could lead to a number of people saying what's the point\nThe point I was making is and I I've been hearing this from a a lot of people that if Kavanaugh goes now and it's just going to fire up troops because Republicans are saying and trying to make it happen and if the if it goes up here but\nI didn't understand the thinking but he just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why don't we have to use in order to win I never understood that why do we have to lose\nKavanaugh in order to gin up turn out I I [noise] depending on how it would happen I'm not sure it would have turned out anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and they go to the voters say we're in a majority and we try we try but we couldn't get to confirm you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in the\n... there there's a disconnect there [noise]\nAnybody ever heard the name of Chris

Scott grabbed a cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against\n... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN's they only cable out and there's no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still it for years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City federal building\nOf course uh I I\nWas living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House on and they issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio this is the by the way this more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nBaby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine and the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [laughter] some public and the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course\nOn Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other digital camera this is the cartoon it has Kevin ... daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another

doing this is a come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vital\nIt's filthy if dirty and disgusting it's despicable and it's sick and of course has accomplished it's objective it's gone viral and people have seen that people are reacting to it\nAnd I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are this is what passes for humor on the left\nThis is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabin on his daughter says another prayer\nDear God forgive

face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\n\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in our lives of suffered psychological ones of the events that had led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nDon't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power and that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some to the quick\nIt disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about it as I just did on CNN NBC News\nDesperately trying to convict Kevin all at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia NBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie ...\n\nUnable to independently corroborate what makes claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw

George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they have been given free rein to interview marble they won so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham

and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself
