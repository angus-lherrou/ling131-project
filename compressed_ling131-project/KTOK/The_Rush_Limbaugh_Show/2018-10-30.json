with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just just just being ... up that Trump's base that the\nImplication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic expression or\nIllustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump but that will get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night it's going to be\nA red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them\nAre committee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes\nSome of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways loses seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest among races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring maybe they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights as you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great book great in the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nPeel a movement but\nHas been has been lost I think by the way the political professionals are going to be\nHyping the fact that as things stand I just probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places things stand now looks like the Democrats white when my house but\nMaybe for the and that's going to be designed to get you to not get lazy and over confident but don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nOh to have been a committee chairman then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture in their place\nAnd this this orders\nWhile in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nominations to replace me never Trump hers who are retiring are Trump supporters\nThey were Trump if and so the the total number forty five resigning is not in and of itself a completely negative\nCharacteristic the power of incumbency still can't be denied it's an amazing thing I think it's still true house races in Ninety eight percent of them\nThe incumbent wins every year year and year out regardless there might be a year or two where there's a\nLarger wider variants than that but that's the overall stat\nBuddy it could well be that the never Trump or is that retired knew they had no prayer anyway in their districts and so they quote unquote took the high road and a lot of stomach Trump chunks of phone I don't I don't want to be part of the potentially split the scene and they're replaced by\nA Trump posts and Trump supporters so that could end up being a net positive okay when we come back the drive by media all over not blaming me we're back first\nIt was the Oklahoma City bombing and now me and others in conservative media being blamed for all of the rest of this today\nAre more churches that are we seeing allowing guns in their services was afternoon at five with me like three thousand\nFreezing cold an incident I Choose so\nTied to limit June [noise] rotation here is that I'd be enough where did you hear about the mass shooting in McDonald's on Saturday [noise]\nYou did when did you you know why because there wasn't one\nAnd you know why there wasn't one because there was a guy in there with a gun and stopped making this up a brave father armed with a pistol stopped what could have been a mass shootings Saturday inside the McDonald's in Alabama when he took down a masked gunman who stormed in an open fire\nYou've not seen that send a drive by media anywhere they identified father was leaving the establishment with his sons when a masked man walked into the Birmingham fast food restaurant started shooting\nThe father returned fire in during the ensuing shootout the gunman a father and one of the man's teenage sons were struck\nGunmen who was not identified later died of his injuries the other two injuries were not considered a life threatening Marcus, Washington one of the employees and like Donald's\nTold WBRC TB in Alabama he was making ... quarter pound there's one of the bullet started flying Marcus, Washington said he ran into the freezer worry heard about Fifteen shots fired [noise] it was all brought to a screeching halt by customer\nWho legally was carrying a gun you didn't hear about this anywhere [noise]\nFox News has it on their website\nBut you didn't hear about it anywhere look let me get straight to the fourteenth amendment business here and the ending of birthright citizenship this is such a big deal a lot of people on the left will get to the audio of of me and others being blamed for all this and in due course I mean it's it's so old it's actually not news anymore and it's\nIt's it's really pathetic of these people on the left because they all started with me being blamed for the Oklahoma City bombing by Bill Clinton and it's just ratcheted up from there and it's all an attempt to suppress political speech the left doesn't want to hear [noise]\n[noise] and now even though the gunman at the synagogue on Saturday in Pittsburgh was\nA guy hated Trump the dry buys are trying to claim that Trump and me\nAnd mark Levin and Breitbart radicalized him we are responsible for this guy shooting up the synagogue\nActually out there running with this and they're they're ... they they're saying it is though as though they believe in its infancy tile it's juvenile it's irresponsible and pathetic and it's all they've got\nAnd they just they just keep at it even when trying to blame me for for Timothy McVeigh shooting up near a building in Oklahoma City\nI'm back then by the way I was alone I mean that was it that was during the Clinton Administration there was no Fox News the whims websites conservative websites and blocks had not yet sprung the life\nAnd it\nWas a job I'll admit it ... I was livid and of course as a lone voice at the time I was a little alarmed can they make this that and of course they weren't able to and even now a certain members\nOf the drive by caution everybody to remind people Clinton try when Clinton was called on it by the way Clinton's hey we talk about [laughter]\nAs talking about that [laughter] Michigan Militia shortwave radio do the right to Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what they said they were talking so it blew up in their faces and this continues to to [noise] but let's get the birthright citizenship\nThis I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through on one of the primary commitments he made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country\nBut primarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws\nDefining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration and actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them are both parties have different reasons for supporting it in the meantime the\nVery definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault and the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country\nOver thrown from the days of its founding\nOut to the left America's illegitimate uh gym morals it's in the sun because we were a slave nation\nAnd we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers there were no founding mothers only founding fathers they're bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a country for themselves and their descendents so goes the argument leaving everybody else out\nAnd it's time to overthrow they have and change it and it's a serious movement and it's\nIt's a ... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise] an offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where\nThe changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story Donald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and the end birthright citizenship\nDownload the free home advisor at [noise]\nOpen up modestly today any sense of the drivers for these moves that's what really seemed to topics on the minds of investors tech and trade\nThe u._k. for example propose to two percent digital services tax starting twenty twenty be imposed on profitable tech companies generating more than half a billion pounds year globally and the U.S threatened the next wave of tariffs on China if talks between these two countries call through next month\nWell then Michael what should investors do given this high level of volatility right now\nAre the key for any investors to check to see if your portfolio is aligned with your own risk tolerance and investment plan being diversified really helps with daily volatility you can check with your ... for natural advisor to review your portfolio and consider any appropriate adjustments\nSex Michael your path to investment advice starts with you were ... financial advisor find yours at ... dot com that's S C I F E L dot com steeple Nicholas in company incorporated member ...

I I have at times I've marvel that this country is held together by the way it has for his many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue to issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm In junior high intramural football in softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until you hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two is five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn were gonna slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derived from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election that is on going\nAnd now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do and it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one is not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't until they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

training without the okay\n\n\nBack to the phones with all of this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... ... it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but another reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that about slavery well\nThe southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are closed that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his\nPoint people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten looking first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's\nWhat's different now there's no interest in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing if they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans\nPeople trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be re establishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company got we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York building your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up eventually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer the legislation that is in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which\nHas to happen there there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's and and\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\nBecause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that is if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world\nAnd otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know has a George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network

present uh for\nThese people come here come the awful crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just think\nAnything can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way I Know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and teen they'd let her across they sent the other sixteen teams with our back\nOn my stomach so they can't say we don't have hot they do see a situation now\nNeed help but you know even Hispanic girls that Trump was horrible that he was still send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them whenever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's um once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in

five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed anymore because\nThere was a direct connection between political speech and violent that's a very serious thing to do that\nShe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack we always ask\nAnd radicalized than what inspired him to go to violent we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as

Washington establishment something you may think that's not very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching and comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs they're being nobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been on the able\nTo diffuse Trump they've been unable to dispatch Trump and it's\nAlways a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always this one way street there's always you don't want is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief\nNot a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I am your ...\nAnd I am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own\nI'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in the presumption up superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat what\nAll of us had been saying to each other but you know we're not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh damp or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you blonde bombed or what\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing and it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that keep\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it in the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there to be tied\nYours the reason that this was all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity [noise]\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about and they sneer at then especially when people aren't looking\nAnd then if that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make an entire narrative and what they believe rush it that that person is an idiot they're not evil\nNow I'm not saying it all that every I'm liberal person is like this I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both sides

I Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana\nIs gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and this is the premise here superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you\nHave a the synagogue shooting quality obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative medium posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for the maybe the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition [noise]\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you if isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut\nThe electoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what's [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
