president\nAnd leadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time than behind the president shameful out that the New York times today tell us to publish an article that the fascination of the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from me that I can think they'll ever and how have for the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by\nA writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president none of them know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun\nDoes that go off and so on nearby

publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying and the Donald Trump needs to dial it back and Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump didn't meanwhile\nThey can call him and not sitting call him Hitler are they going to lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now isn't the Tonight Show on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself emphatic I'd laugh at it has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of
