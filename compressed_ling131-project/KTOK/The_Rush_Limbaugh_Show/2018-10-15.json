Russia ... behind the gold any ivy a microphone great to have you here [noise] yeah\nWe're going to be discussing them in terms of the media is now flooding the zone with polling data showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just folks steel yourself for this this is predictable\nIt was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip regretting their vote for Trump uh rent reading the direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN\nA independent voters switching math ... Democrats in the run up to mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of\nThis I in a in an added to it in a way I Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the early voting that that is uh\nThat that's happening out there so it's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together you don't well I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the election is um the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have it everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data\nAnd says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trans is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voting for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\n\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get by\n\nFor the tactics they have engaged in from the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union mine was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hobby on some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily went in within this country for so many years I knew willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like they don't ...\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect you know and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's just it's confrontational and of course in the eye and for the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but\nBut that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want\nThis guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in the history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it it will review says he's going to do something he's going to\nOther where the ... and the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total ...\nThey're taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders while they're at their family their their their adult parents cases are big adjudicate there's nothing\nAnd\nIn Nineteen forty one the U.S so was born\nTo honor and comfort the men and women of our

before you have insurance then you get the disease and you want the insurance\nYou know other walk of life can you do that you can't set your house on fire and then call State Farm or whoever and buy homeowner's policy to protect you against fire they won't sell it to you\nYou can't\nHave a bunch of stuff stolen from your house and they go by theft insurance\nNobody will sell it to you but when it comes to health care uh if they don't ... to get in all hell breaks loose and their ripped to shreds there's there's no there's no making money insurance people with preexisting conditions which then engenders the original\nIf that's what's wrong people profiting from other people being sick and not just shouldn't be more drama people should be given no cure for nothing and the people should provided for the for the good news took their hearts and\nThat's how it works out and when you have a political party that promotes that kind of thinking it's very very tough to compete with it so\nSomehow in this polling data preexisting conditions has come up and the Democrats are once again try to make hay on it by claiming the Republicans want to take it away in fact in Pennsylvania Bob casey and the Senate Senate race there\nBob casey has run an ad claiming that the Republican candidate for the Senate wants to deny his own granddaughter\nMedical treatment she has cancer she's a single digit age ... she's a she's a baby\nIn case he's running an ad saying that the Republicans so anti people that he wants his own daughter to not be given insurance to treat her I mean it it is it's sick and they've got they've jumped all over Casey Casey campaign so we're not going to pull the ad\nSo the Democrats are running on preexisting conditions and the fact that Republicans have know hearts when all the other Trump stuff and then the and in St Paul talks about this massive wave of independents that all of a sudden according to their policy in life\nWell [noise]\nFrom the McClatchy News Washington bureau headlined Republicans worry that Trump and his aides have no idea the hell that may or white\n[noise]\nThis article by Anita Kumar uses anonymous interviews with Washington Republicans and Obama Clinton and Bush hangers on\nRepublicans who support President Trump have grown fearful that the White House is prepared for the onslaught that may awaits them in January if a blue wave\nSucceeds in giving the Democrats control of at least in the house of representatives in the mid term elections in November Democrats\nWill have the power to subpoena documents and force a dentist ration officials to testify about a slew of scandals\nIncluding edge using private email for government business agency's spending taxpayer money Trump resorts and sexual assault allegations involving Brett Kavanaugh five Republicans with close ties to the White House\nSaid that instead of preparing for what could be a years long attacked by a newly emboldened Democrat run Congress Trump aides are wasting time trying to respond to nonstop controversies Trump tweets on the investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election\nTheir story says that the White House should be hiring more staff to handle a congressional inquiries advising administration officials to retain their own lawyers and researching potential areas of vulnerability ranging from the death of four soldiers in Africa to the sluggish response\nTo Hurricane Maria according to people who worked for Presidents Clinton Bush and Burr rock Hussein oh [noise] now [noise] [noise] at first glance you would think that this was a story that Trump and his buddies are not aware of the show lacking they're going to take\nIn three weeks that they are blissfully on aware that they're going to lose the house maybe lose the Senate this story focuses on what's gonna happen if that happens and\nTo that extent this story under cells what is going to happen if the Democrats gained control of the house if the Democrats game control of the house every investigation into the deep state and the scandal\nInvolving Hillary and her emails and the ... the spying on the Trump and all of that stops no answers will be forthcoming no punishment to those involved they will get away with it\nAnd that's just the first thing\n\nVirtually every thing Donald Trump has achieved will be rolled back they will do their best to reinstitute tax increases you know what I'm going to prepare a list of things\nThis might actually make a good I was talking about this the first the artist might make a good\nUm illustration of what's gonna happen if the Democrats win it's not just the Democrats gaming control and by the way it's not just\nThis story focuses on Trump and his buddies are not yet prepared that they're not aware that they're not focusing on the Democrats are gonna come investigate Trump and everybody associated with it that's going to happen and I can't believe companies people aren't aware of that\nUh\nI think it's what Trump's doing for rallies all week\nI think that's why Trump is working harder than any Republican at this moment to keep the Republicans in control of the house in the Senate\nIdea Trump doesn't get what's in the door if if if if this happens but specifically aside from all those things that they're going to aim at Trump the policy\nInitiatives that have led to this great rebound and recovering economy is going to be brought to a screeching halt walks\n[noise]\nYou can say goodbye Trump these trade deals with Trump is they're going to start working on on doing everything Trump did at the same time paralyzing the remaining two years of the Trump Administration in terms of what is never going to get another judge confirmed any court ... court anywhere\nNot a single one talk will be we can't confirm a judge nominated by a guy who may be impeached we can't confirm a judge nominated by a guy who's not even going to be reelected in twenty twenty we can't do any of that in fact we've got to prepare\nBy unraveling everything this man has done and they're going to portray this as a dangerous twilight zone two years apart were for the American people\nIt's\nIt's gonna be it's going to be brutal and you know when it's ... it's going to be what would have happened if Hillary in one\nExcept if Hillary had one we wouldn't know\nOver fifty percent of what we do know about just say the deep state for example and the efforts that they have made to undermine Trump's election has campaigned his presidency stop and think of all the things we wouldn't even know if Hillary had one\nOr read a Lynch would be on the Supreme Court probably a Lois Lerner might be running the IRS or take your pick Koskinen wouldn't go anywhere\n\nStruck stroke

was\n\nIt's going to be brutal let me get back to the audio soundbites oh just one more thing about this poll the headline Republicans worry trumpet his aides have no idea what the hell no idea the held that may away what does this may business it is is there is no you're not sure you're going to win\nThe White House is completely on prepared for the onslaught it will face if the house flips says a former official in the Trump White house\nWho would that be like Omarosa\nFrom a communications perspective but White House completely unprepared for the onslaught it will face if the house lips I Can't believe there's a soul in there that doesn't know what's coming\nA second former Trump adviser said simply the White House was only able to focus on one thing at a time well that's an absolute be asked Trump proves that every day\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have largely protected the Trump White house ... serious investigations which is not unusual when the White House and
