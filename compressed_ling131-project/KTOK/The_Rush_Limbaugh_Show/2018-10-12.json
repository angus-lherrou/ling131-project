tax dot com [noise]\nGland thanks [noise]\nDone [noise] I'll talk to you later [noise] flown\nTo the program glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve\nOff the air is fascinating you they're really really really a fascinating is one of those guys to his you know really walk through the fire for his principles um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nLike what he says about Donald Trump down from South problem not just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and\nAnd how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at how Donald Trump is reflecting a those guys if you will be really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I much I don't know if I mention is off the air but there's a story in the New York times to visit the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure\nAnd it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kicked the Michael ... when they go a low Isay hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\n'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take 'em behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic ... what's the difference between\nThat and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that\nThe ... this what they're saying they are trying to pose as Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves at the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out\nAnd said the holder comments were bad that's her phrase that was being criticized strain but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service\nThe Obama administration played lip service disability paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to a lot of ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat justice hard nose\nThey at least tried to hide it\nThis switch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said there's no it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the the that was his deal mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X\nThings might have been worse for ... for ah for blacks for a while\nI mean you're back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean people want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the ... right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist right like\nThere's very few people were like you know what the right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write ugly I don't want\nThat I mean there was an actual death in Charlottesville writing and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was also over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and who's going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\nThey just won't recognize it uh and\nYou know who won the leftist standing up

believe in climate change do people over more than just rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy\nBecause while this guy is jumping all in my chili listened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professors says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think these clowns in\nBoston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change and man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking\nTheir lives does University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr\nJohn Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers here's the headline\nIn an article written by this guy was published in the guardian and not some obscure little rag\nOr penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is still reigns this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states\nWho voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon\nThemselves by voting Republicans into office\nYou tell one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote pointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office\nThat more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction of the south is so\nThis clown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally this one is what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised\nAs Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the heck's is\n\nI mean this [laughter] if it if it weren't so irresponsible\nIt would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\n\nAnd what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're an African American you venture off the Democrat plantations they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this\nProfessor a professor of engineering literally tells people that if you want to stop\nHurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes coming after you know do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so there were people out there saying that Bush actually wanted the hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have\nTo leave would have to go to Houston there\nWere some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\nWell\nI didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there\nTalking on a tax on the Internet Hoover claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane remember that that Bush was hearing that hurricane Bush himself the president was nearing the hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply the way people\nVote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes\nGoing to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know\nAnd generations and maturity\nAlways get the leftist propaganda on\nEvery particular issue that's why they recycle the ten year morning [noise]\n[noise] [noise] hey guys have you been hearing

the U.S and we're talking about well the climate change everything burning up oh they never tell us what the optimal temperature is a but every time the temperature goes up a few degrees\nLarge swaths of Canada Russia China that are you know on the job will turn into a better agricultural areas and we ended up a feeding more people okay some points\nOr a mayor ten thousand years ago here in the Midwest we have this giant oil a shirt sitting over most of the country and then this wonderful thing where the climate warmed up and we have this area that's suddenly feeding the world so every time the temperature goes up\nA little bit a way the more people so I don't know what the what the problem is I mean\nLike Oh yes the ... the problem is they're trying to scare everybody into signing on to this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing to the whole premise of climate change your green do a lot you're agreeing you are to blame\nAnd that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make amends and how do you do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you you agreed to start criticizing everybody else\nSo they get you to accept blame then you also admit that gigantic\nOrganizations are the only way to structure our lives and to protect everybody so it's it's simply a waving guilt people into accepting\nWhen they don't even know this is being done to them the premise of socialism communism under the guise of saving the planet but\nYour point about the optimal temperature I've expressed that in a different way over the years how do we know folks that climate conditions right now\nIn the entire history of this plan on how many hundreds of thousands of years whatever it is how do we know that the temperature and the climate right now is optimal is perfect is what it should always be how do we know that\nWe don't\nIt's the vanity of these people assuming

[noise] but she put it out and of course the median ran with it and they've had to withdraw because she had to withdraw it because it wasn't true\nAnd it's it's\nFairly common that these people on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ...\nThe Democrats and blue wave is drying up oh that'll be a disappointment don't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team in terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely he'll Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet and we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave what if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asking how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could a generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be a\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the authority and the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other seat that they have they\nHeld by incumbents at at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's [noise]\nAnd they go state by state to show her this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power winds ... that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen but then you go into the state's state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight and probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wants to the murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interest in in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that climate guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele marketing was one of the leaders also people at like ed Morsi of hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred\nAnd sixty different articles so the trick is how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars and again people start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing I'll be your door and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a it's a procedural\nMoving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about want an abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore\nAnd violence in the movie at its depicted in it\nOtherwise it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can't avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the room\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about what he did Kermit guys now was\nDespicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so the\nWay I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with this deem Kane is one\nWho is reportedly been dismembered murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\n\nBecause of his criticism of the crown prince and Saudi Arabia

Donald Trump and his open disdain and criticism of the media\nIs sent to have made Mohammed bin and sell them on comfortable with the fact that he can get away with murder and journalists because Donald Trump made him think it'd be okay this is what the American media is now [noise]\nBeginning district you know this was just a tweet from a Yahoo guy holding cough but this don't be surprised\nIf it starts blowing up [noise]\nFrom this point forward right now\nWhat does that for them but I Want to shake your hand Lee masses really wants to be okay\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] then again those satisfaction of stone Nineteen sixty five boroughs [noise] before we got back to the phones one quick\nThing there's a an NBC opinion piece that uh has appeared in opposition to the guys know movie\nAnd here's the headline that his face legal abortion is vilified by the pro life cause no movie which inadvertently shows the dystopia of a post row America so whereas we have a bunch of journalists trying to blame Donald Trump\n\nFor inspiring Mohammed bin ... mom to murder a sold a Saudi journalist\n[noise] now we have this NBC piece which is basically saying that what this movie is inadvertently\nShowing is what will happen if abortion ever becomes illegal guys like God's noble springing up everywhere that guys now could not have become the mass murderer he became\nIf abortion would have been legal which is a crock he did his monitoring\nAfter abortion it'd become legal [noise] but they're trying to say everybody you know you better you'd better not get what you wish for here because if you if you ever get abortion we have a roe versus Wade overturned you're going to have people like guys know popping up left and right\nWhich misses the entire point of this movie but that's not a surprise\nAt opponents would try to miss Kass what's going on with this tweet saying that the crown prince may have felt in Bolden by Trump's anti media rhetoric to murder a journalist [noise]\nYeah that happens in this country right we have a history of murdering journalist Donald Trump got that it was the first was the first hurdle is Trump corner to be killed somebody told me [noise]\nThese irresponsible jackass is okay head back to the phones to Jim in Jupiter, Florida right up the road great to have you with us or high\n...
