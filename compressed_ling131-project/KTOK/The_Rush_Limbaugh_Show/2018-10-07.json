about to explain you can live out your retirement with less stress and more comfort\nAnd you ever thought possible there are actually two purposes for money only to know more and no is the first purpose is life and the second purpose is that\nNow I bet you've never heard that before I'm sure everyone you've listened to or taking advice from has always tried to tell you about growing your money but has never told you about the purpose of money so what does that mean a purpose for life or for that\nWhen I say that one purpose for money is life I mean that you are going to use the money while you are alive in our business we call that income duck right with income no matter how you look at it if you spend the money while you're alive\nYou're taking income from that money for the purpose of life\nWhen I say that another purpose for money is death that means that you are going to use the money once you are dead or you're not actually going to use it but we call that legacy in other words you are going to pass them money onto your heirs\nAfter you're gone now it's critical your financial planner understands the importance of creating strategies for both the purpose of life

seven to three three so like I said there are only two purposes for money spending the money while you are live or leaving the money to those left behind\nBy far the most significant purpose of money is into it is one thing to not leave your beneficiaries any money when you were gone\nBut it is a disaster if you outlive your money\nIn fact studies show that outliving retirement income is feared more than that or public speaking not the purpose of your money is income\nThere are only two plans for that purpose one is called a plan for death\nAnd the other a plan for life and if you have a broker or financial planner that isn't an expert and plans for life\nI'm certain you were on a plan for up what is a plan for death when it comes to retirement income well here it is you save up your money and invest it and something that provides a hypothetical non guaranteed right of return or short term guaranteed ready to return in other words\nYou have no guaranteed for long term growth you might hope\nFor seven percent compound a growth but after fees and market crashes and rate aspirations and so forth you have no idea what kind of return you're going to get in fact\nYou don't know if you're going to get any return because the next two thousand eight might be right around the corner you save up your money hoping it grows\nAnd then at the point you decided to retire you start drawing income from your house how much do you draw for present three percent five percent or do you just drop out them out you need and hope for the rest the problem with this plan is that your hypothetical growth\nIs combined with an arbitrary spend out of your retirement accounts you have no idea if the plan is going to work\nBecause you don't know how long you're going to live\nIf you die sooner than you thought you spent too little\nAnd if you live longer than you thought you will probably run out of money before you die in order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to

Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court\nBut how do you take this criticism that it it you know that\nTea Party the far right up the of the Republican Party has had a view over the years as you've been trying to do your business up on Capitol Hill\nWell it's pretty hard to be the majority leader there sign it without getting some criticism I'd rather be judged by my record and I think what this has been an extraordinarily accomplished Congress or in fact the the most productive two year period right of center in the time I've been on a set it whether it's taxes\nAre regulations that we've gotten the economy a booming and we're making long term ... a systemic changes in the courts so will serve a future generation of Americans in a very good way\nI Know that there have been some bipartisan accomplishment says well you voted on an FAA bill and us last week you also did a big bell or to fight the opioid crisis but there there's no question that this Kavanaugh\nConfirmation battle has come at a cost that just the relations between Republican senators in Democratic senators seem to have I have taken a downturn Here's Democratic senator decided to a democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nOr on the floor this week talking about and criticizing you for delaying them after what he said was your ten months delay a and blocking the nomination of Merrick Garland from President Obama Harris Schumer\nNo American should accept his admonished minutes about delay he's the master of delay compared to ten months [noise] leaving the ... seat open who are we kidding senator how broken is this at\nThe centers are broken and we did an attack Merrick Garland showed background or try to destroy and we didn't go on a search and destroy mission we simply followed\nThe tradition and America which is that if you have a party of the different uh different uh shut out of a different parties and the president you don't fill a vacancy created in the presidential here that what all the way back to Eighteen eighty eight\nSchumer himself said Eighteen months before the end of the Bush tenure that if a vacancy occurred they would fill it so what we did was followed tradition but we did an attack on dominated we didn't go on a search and destroy mission I agree that with a truck surely there's been a low point in the Senate\nI have a different view about who caused a low point a shot and traditionally Democrats are licking a doctor forge name\nA against apparently her desires then tried to lower the ... and say that the presumption of innocence no longer applies\nUh in the United states of America and then the mob descended on Capitol Hill and tried to intimidate are members\nInto opposing this good man a nomination or we stood up to the mob we establish that the the presumption of innocence is still important I'm proud of my colleagues as an important day for the United states at all I\nHave to pick up on something that you said because it and maybe I have this wrong but when you block Merrick Garland\nNomination from President Obama you basically said that we don't do this in a presidential election year and that we wait until the election and then whoever the people choose they get to pick the Supreme Court nominee but but when you just said now whether it's a question of whether or not it's\nThe the uh the the party in control of the Senate\nIs different than the president of the question I guess I I'm getting to here is if Donald Trump were to name somebody in the final year of his first term in twenty twenty are you saying that you would go ahead without nomination\nButter center question and what I told your was what the what the history of the senators band you have to go back to the Eighteen eighty to find the last time a vacancy created in a presidential election year\nAll the Supreme Court was confirmed by the Senate of a different party than the president's efforts to do and if you can answer my question are you saying that while they're on the answer to your question is will see whether there's a vacancy on twenty twenty\nBut you're not ruling out the possibility since you're the Republican majority leader and as a Republican president that you would go for an end and push the nomination of a Trump nominee in the election year\nWhat I'm telling you is the history is you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time a Senate controlled by party different from the president fill the vacancy all the Supreme Court that was created in the middle of a presidential election here that's been the history\nThe final question is are in the Alabama Senate race last year you very quickly sad after a judge Roy Moore was accused of inappropriate conduct an towards teenagers uh many years ago you immediately said that you believe the women why didn't you believe Christine Blasey Ford\nI Can't imagine comparing Brett Kavanaugh the Roy Moore\nWell I've been but they're the comparison I'm not I'm not comparing them down I'm comparing the\nMultiple love to bowl witnesses over and over and over kept popping up here we had an FBI investigation\nAnd three members of our conference who are undecided took a look at the uh beyond restoration and two of the three decided to confirm judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] the only point out banks are trying to get an argument with you is you oppose the FBI investigation\nAnd it was negotiated an office uh we we agreed on the parameters of the FBI investigation in a meeting of office friday a week ago Senator McCaskill center calling Sarah flick that was the scope of the FBI investigation we're ready to go on for a week\nAnd we agreed we would talk to people that Dr ... and the people that are Romero said mentioned and that's the investigation that was done\nAnd our members who were undecided took a look at the a report and two or three of them decided to support the nominee Senator McConnell up but it's what Chris I think it's outrageous to compare Brett Kavanaugh Roy Moore\nI didn't do so I was simply comparing the fact that in one case you believed the accusers and are not the case you didn't I'm not comparing judge Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh\nSo good because there is no comparison Kathy on that we're a great thank you for your time today sir and congratulations [noise]\nNow joining us here in Washington a key Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee Lindsey Graham the senator and I I had I had to hesitate to get into as after that conversation with Michel kind of I think um you generally as a happy political warrior but I gotta say over the last couple of weeks you have seemed angry and I guess I'm\nI'm questioning what has gotten so much on New Year's getting I wanted to take a look at at Lindsey Graham over the last couple of weeks here you are this is the most unethical\nSince I've been in politics I thought she was handled respectfully\n... was treated like crap\nYeah yourself [laughter]\nSo why are well now you're looking you seem happy but why are you are or have you been on the happy warrior these couple of weeks I'm happy because the effort to humiliate\nAnd railroad man I've known for Twenty years has never been banned from a mall I like Roy Moore failed\nI'm happy that those who tried to destroy his life fell short\nI'm Glad those who've tried to overturn the rule of law and replace it with mob rule last\nI've never been more tests than my life I voted for so tomorrow and Kagan I Would never done this to them this character assassination [laughter] this is warning power too much to the extent that I came to the age of this good man and helped defeat this debacle I'm happy as a class All right\nWell let me tell you something that may not make you happier bring it up\nBecause it appears the cabinet confirmation is not going to end this fight that democratic congressman Jerry ... head a New York who would if the Democrats take the house but come the house judiciary chairman has already talked about launching an investigation into alleged misconduct by Capitol Nancy Pelosi says she wants to see the FBI\nInterviews in the second background check it it doesn't sound like this was going to end well\nIf a will now and November at that makes sense I Hope everybody running for the house in these purple districts blast will be asked a question do sport in teaching judge Kavanaugh based on five allegations none of which could be cooperated do you want an outcome so badly that you would basically turned the law upside down\nWell it's a precedent in a lot of ways right it I think the the thing that was most disturbing to Republican senators is to watch the presumption of innocence completely evaporate before our eyes in the context and the Senate Judiciary committee and all of a sudden allegations however serious they might be without any kind of cooperation will begin beginning to carry the day and I think\nFrom a ... point of view and from Lindsey Graham your previous guest ... what they tried to do was get to the information provided the information make sure that every senator had an opportunity not only review the FBI report with all the testimony and letters that came in and eventually they would come to the conclusion that judge Kavanaugh Sherman justice Kevin\n... I Know that Democrats are going to do their best to link\nThe events of this week in the last few weeks to the me too movement to say it's another demonstration of Republicans hostility towards women I I Want to play though a clip from the deciding vote on this issue and that was a woman the Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine here she is\nAny allegation fails to me the more likely than not standard there before I Do not believe that the charging ten fairly per bad judge cabin uh friends surfing on the court\nBrewery what a Republican is supposed to do when the FBI does this background check and fails to come up with a single piece of evidence to corroborate Dr Ford story what are they supposed to do well\nI think what you'll hear from Democrats crafts is that it became clear over the past week particularly since the hearing\nRight that everything since that hearing the FBI investigation who they were allowed to actually speak to the fact that they didn't we interview Brett Kavanaugh or Christine forward it became clear to many people that this appear to be a box checking exercise it with a faint believe designed to provide legitimacy I had\nTalked to are predicting that everybody that Christine Blasey Ford had put\nNear that house that night and other people who were left the house that night but might have to be able to ... what I mean and yes they say well she didn't talk to people you talked to in the ... on the beach Twenty years later but in terms of anybody bought a contemporaneous account they talked\nTo everybody didn't get her therapist notes from ... years ago many years later and I\nThat's my ... I Will say one of the new ... new and I are talking about right now they didn't do right so many people who already believe the Republican Party has a problem with winning this exercise this week long investigation to\nThem will look like it was just designed to get legitimacy trip pre ordained outcome and if it's what's been said since then it's Donald Trump making fun of Christine forward it orange hatch\nPalin survivors of sexual assault he will listen to them when they grow up this is a pattern of anger has been building for two years since Donald Trump was elected me to start at a year ago on friday this is not just about the Supreme Court they said about the broader\nCultural moment we are living in a lot of people feeling like the Republican Party quite frankly doesn't care about winning a while and the argument Democrats are going to make I think\nI think this was brutish politics I agree with Maria I think the\nFBI pro was a sham I was a whitewash\nAnd I think most people understand that the constraints were put in place by the White House is worth thoroughly political process is I think it was on his Josh I think the damage here\nIs just so many American institutions where past the point obviously she is confirmed they did this in a rush yesterday is that there's more to come and they want to make sure that he's already in place but\nThe key here is the damage we've seen damage to our intelligence institutions under this president to the FBI right I'm going to have a set of ... the Supreme Court there is damage Chris lasting\nWell right I mean I Know it it will go well I Wish I Wish we want to play well with one another area well All right ... ...\n... this is going to intensify voters on both ends of the spectrum this has turned up the volume I was already a very intense very embittered\nMay get to politics and the next segment what do you think of the argument that this was a sham the FBI investigation that wasn't as serious invest\nWhen you know you're in Washington when a one week the Republicans do you that the FBI is a rotten corrupt institution that should not be listened to the Democrats say that they're the saviors of our republic and then you wait a week and they just switch lanes and the White House has turned around and loves the FBI and Democrats say they think so I don't put I don't put too much\nI don't put too much stock in that because those are situational opinions of attitudes that are going to ship with an extra\nVerse I I I think there's one thing that we need to clear up here because I Democrats are just sort of re appropriate facts on how this FBI vet fish and came to be and what happened was Senator Flake decided along with senator Coons that they needed interviews that worked before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIn order to have more full full some decision so they when they went to leader McConnell and sat down and talked about what that FBI investigation might look like and one of Donald Trump who is dictating the terms of the FBI investigation in fact it were the senators who still had an open mind about the nomination and so they're the ones that dictate terms on the ... century just\nBy chance I Would say can you admit that the fact that the two key people weren't we intervene and that there were no humor is people who gave information and we're never contacted by the FBI that left lingering questions ... ... it's a talking point not someone who try to look at this fairly I don't think at the talking but I heard\nFrom Republicans over the last three years why would Hillary Clinton interview so late in the FBI why wasn't she under oath they didn't even catch\nAll right let me go to another well out is if you want but if there was a simple matter is the way it is not a penalty for perjury\nWhether it's with the Senate Judiciary committee or whether the FBI\nAnd interviews an interview with an interview and we had three plus hours of judge Kavanaugh three plus our haters by senator is not by FBI does matter outlook record and that is the same thing that you get an an FBI investigation and so this is talk and point\nThe idea that we don't know what each each person's take was on the situation I don't know how can point only or only underscores\nThat I'm Glad we got on us and the confirmation\nOf what happened in the debate happening out there right now well\nWe're about to bring you back a little bit later to talk about this up next we'll discuss the political fallout from the capital\nConfirmation and our will strikes a vote in the November midterm

while Republicans feel more optimistic about keeping control of both houses of Congress\nBut just how big of capital bump will we see in November\nJoining me now Republican Party chair Ronald McDaniel welcome back to Fox News Sunday great to be here or we should note though that we invited ... is the chair Tom ... rose to join us as well he deployed but we're very happy to have you here thrilled to be here all the fight over the capital confirmation seems to have\nEnergized Republican voters I Want to take a look at a poll let's put it up\nIn a pool in July Seventy eight percent of Democrats or the November elections are quote very important compared to sixty percent of Republicans but in a new poll about ten point intensity or enthusiasm gap there's no one to two points eighty two percent for Democrats eighty percent for Republicans what is it\nAbout the Kavanaugh confirmation process that you that goes mobilize your voters\nI think it's been a combination of things that Democrats\nHave doubled down on resistant obstruct the past two years but this has brought all of that to the forefront with the protests at the interruptions during the hearings and now\nWith the smear campaign of judge Kavanaugh holding these allegations back towards it to the eleventh hour I think Republicans have woken up and said listen it's a very clear choice do we want ... resist obstruct delay a dysfunction in Washington and and they're also think the results three point seven percent unemployment for a million new jobs\nOr anybody has introduced convincing evidence and that kind of thing even though this was not a legal proceedings we're talking about putting a man on the high court but I think\nLooking at the numbers that you put up and you can see that it alienated a lot of also white women Republicans independence and that's why you see the gap that was displayed in those numbers so if you're looking at the races\nHere to talk about race in suburban districts outside of major metropolitan areas many of them that went for Hillary Clinton but have a Republican House member\nI think you put those in greater danger separate situation with regard to the state races because so many races but at the moment in this twenty Eighteen cycle are red state where the Democrats are trying to defend and I think you're going to have more problems there although it's telling the Joe Donnelly of Indiana Heidi Heitkamp a and others\nDecided they were going to vote against Kevin\nLet me turn to you Josh\n... what about this analysis and and uh one just referred to it that this is going to may play differently in statewide Senate races than a dozen much more localized\nHouse races and that it will benefit particularly given the map and the fact that the Republicans have so few states up and Democrats up so many in so many of them are in Republican red states that Donald Trump ran that it could help a lot in the Senate races but could hurt for instance in those key swing suburban districts that now have a Republican congressman\nSo I mean I think there's a danger of over analyzing based on data that we don't know what we do know is that Republicans have been absolutely set on fire by this we also know the Democrats had basically the best political environment and the generation before they decided to hand the microphones Spartacus for they're closing argument here\nNow we've found is out ourselves past Kavanaugh is these red states like Indiana North Dakota Missouri West Virginia in particular are a huge danger now Joe Manchin may have done himself a favor by voting for Kavanaugh\nBut the rest of these are in significant danger what we don't know is whether those Republican voters who supported Republicans in Fort twelve fourteen and sixteen will be there and suburban America which Republicans have had a problem with but we also don't know\nThat women are monolithic voting bloc here I think that some of the data has shown that suburban women see this very very differently than Democrats would like them to do agree with that very\nWell I think it's a little too early to tell but what I Do know is that suburban went in for the last year and a half\nHas been really moving away from the Republican Party because President Trump and his actions and his comments and the next thirty days there are a lot of things we don't know but I can guarantee that President Trump will likely say things that uh than many people are particularly I Know last\nThat remind many independent and Republican women why they're uncomfortable with hand and a lot of this ... and the Republican Party may dissipate because President Trump can't get out of his own way\nI I did think that the Republican Party should recognize this is bigger than have now Democrats have been on fire for two years they said this and Democrats mind is the latest in a pattern of not taking winning seriously and that's the argument they're going to make it's not going to be a Supreme Court ought to be about the overall message I think ...\nI think the X factor that we have an attendant here is increase in democratic voter registration that's right and it's very high and it's continued remember Republicans are unable to run\nOn repeal of Obamacare unable to run on building a border wall or reducing the deficit I think you look at a lot of these districts going back to Pennsylvania Eighteen Conor Lamb or the Alabama Senate race and you see\nThat the dynamic is this is a referendum on Trump and Republicans had little before cabin off to fire up the base we've seen them fired up now does that last but\nOne of the things crust that do you get a sense Republicans have got to say is\nThat the Democrats have so overplay their hand and cabinet and they'll continue to overplay it they can talk and you heard the president say that they want to talk about impeaching him they want to talk about impeaching Brett Kavanaugh Jerry novel or the potential House Judiciary chairman is talking about launching an investigation\nThey can run against you put these guys in charge and that's really what the president was saying that it's a mob and you don't give a match to the arsonist\nAnd that's why I've been saying for months and months and months that probably the best thing for Donald Trump's twenty twenty reelection it's for Republicans to lose ... small majority\nDemocrats because this is where Trump is that his performance in best when he is fighting viciously brutally with the other side but he ended up\nWinning argument for him to prevent Democrats from taking over those while at work and this is this election\nIt will help him in the Senate the reality here is just out of trace some judges right it's too soon to say but on a trace it looks like this it's helpful for Republicans in the Senate because of the map and is one pointed out at the historically Amos map for Democrats are but in the house is probably helpful for Democrats or because of where the districts this has been contesting\nWhat about the argument Murray that you hear some of the Republicans make the Democrats overplayed their hair out in this case and that it has created a backlash and that that's going to hurt the Democrats\nWhich is an insider's guide to no market risk retirement strategies that will show you how to protect your money from high fees and market down parents give me a call anytime at eight seven seven five for eight safe that's eight seven seven five for eight seven to three three\nLet's talk about some more risks we've taken live how about buying a home for many people buying a home is one of the largest purchases they will ever make\nWhat risk do you have when you buy out for one\nYou have risk of market value lost\nA lot of people learn that in two thousand eight right many people thought that there was no significant risk from home values going down but that perception has now changed\nAnd what about risk of property loss flood fire and those dreaded earthquakes that we seem to have every five minutes around here when storms and theft\nThey're all things that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car a boat an airplane\nIf you're on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if you own any other property with significant value there is a risk of loss when you're on something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you probably know the answer insurance right\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they were probably never used so why would you buy insurance on your home you might say well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it\nWell that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it is small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let's let's assume you live in a modern home up to current building 'cause you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't light candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial loss so they're relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why don't you have

E. S. genesis health dot com and the clinic phone number is that for\nZero five seven six three seven six zero three\nOkay now\nWe've talked about this pulse wave therapy before but I think it's so very very important in fact I asked my friend that you're you're doing a\nStudent so stimulation with the promo therapy if you've added um the pulse wave to cause I said it will also help regenerate and brings students fill in blood flow but maybe you wait till you're done with promote before you look at other options I don't know\nHow you are intermingled some of the different ... Modelo these you\nYeah or with your friend way way do start with a fellow therapy or many times what the back in the neck problems\nOr because we want to regain the structural integrity in those measurements but then\nUh it is right that sometimes after we've gone through a short series their way may do a few of the pulse rate therapies because it's really going to be beneficial to the the ... all the muscle connective tissue it is going to help the ligaments and even activates some ...\nProperties as well um and and so sometimes there is an application to do a one and then the other that's true\nWell and now let's talk about the one that's all that you hear one company around town always talking about how they're going to get a man back when he can't function functioning sexually like he did when he was younger\nAnd they're talking about using a hormones and maybe some nitric oxide which is fantastic I Am a total supportive those but you have a new technology that takes it to another level and I know it's been around in Europe for a while but this new here in the United states explaining his poll that exactly\nRight the pulse wave therapy just literally the same equipment we were talking about for Moscow scale of things has been shown in Europe for over six ten years and it was brought to the U.S about two or three years ago um I've been practicing in the clinic for over a year\nAnd and we can help man's sexual health or through pulse wave therapy so it's it's noninvasive um it is a is it is a treatment that regenerate the health\nAnd the vitality of the blood vessels and the man or it helps break down the micro plaque in the vessels of the man or it will increase sensitivity at will and grace\nUm seizing gr you know of of their action and so\nI remember that guys when we're in a wives it'd increase the size as well go ahead I'm Sorry [laughter]\nAnd and so for most man what we well for all men we start off with a a questionnaire it's it's specifically designed for eighty issues and and based on the scoring there that directs us as to what we recommend for instance I have some man that have come in to\nReally have very very mild are almost no effect of the day but they know that they're you know they have some issues and they all they needed a a couple of treatments and and you know is one of my men came back a ... he was going to be coming back for a surge trait but like I called a\nTo a remind him of his appointment have said hey can we hold off on that and he says I'm back I'm great\nAnd so that super we're glad for that I'm\nNot a bit wives who sent you a flyers and stuff to your office [laughter]\nUm and and then we have a most men and the mild to moderate category they usually go through a series of six of the treatments and actually\nI throw in a seventh as a complementary thing just because I'm building this area of the practice\nA but but as we go through those treatments than the the acoustic way for pulse wave a reinvigorate those blood vessels it actually also stimulates and a A N G O near genesis or there's new blood vessel formation\nUm increased sensitivity and there are a certain number of men out there that have a fibrous black\nUh called ... and it helps break down that fibers plaque so that's another\nIndication but for the for the men with common mild to moderate usually looking at a short series of about six or seven treatments and again\nI'm ... years ... cream but it's it's not an invasion of therapy well tolerated they're in and out of the clinic in about twenty minutes and uh so we've seen some real favorable response there\nNow or we don't have much time here but this also folks can be used on neuropathy because what's causing with newer off the the breakdown of blood vessels nerves it can be used for women to help regenerate their their sexual Oregon or to get the sensitivity and um blood flow back\nSo it has a broader application and it's also use on the spine the nic as we talked about in different ways or the needy or or any other place at the nerves need to be reaching reading the blood flow so I think it really ...\nMet him I mentioned to a success rates through the years in Europe as well as in the U.S after those six treatments for the mild to moderate or you know somewhere around eighty percent of men have seen significant in in an Smith\nAnd for men that are on the little blue ... bill the the vibrancy Alice are about two thirds of them are able to get off of it and about eighty percent of them that still use it find that it has significantly and responded better to those\nIs too bad I don't think you were able to do it because of the chest cavity with it too bad you can't do it to the heart itself since uh open up the blood vessels breaking down the plaque especially in the ...\nFilmmaker area the artery there and regenerate and hard is it possible to do it on something like that\nI haven't seen that application of it as you know probably because it's a heart so deep and the chest wall right\nIt may come someday folks ah yeah and I could see where that could be a tremendous breakthrough [noise] um yeah if I was in the
