people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not at all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped\nIt's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious you know there there there is no you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't wanna scare everybody is exactly the threat to this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm of it with seven thousand people that\nMaybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet

somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of leftist set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is and it's not a caravan it's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive

you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dump\nOn wedding Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a century be cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives\nIf you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Benghazi disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\n\nThose are all lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousand tenet germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWhat would you think about it ... you remember who started or remember\nWho's and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up seeing him but you're you're so far but neither he can't see you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is critical I'm going to strike for rock Obama\nClinton and create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he did not want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they step aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia\nOn getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meeting I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an auditor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against the interest of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when it came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand Sam\nPut a picture up we've got a picture for you to get a camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh can we have to picture side by side make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada on the right is Trump last night in Houston\nBitter about having to admit that the investigation has gone nowhere\nThat's why you're calling it the Mahler fairy tale [noise]\nThey really believe despite the absence of any evidence despite what there is to know about how the FBI stacked the deck\nAnd planted spies and invented the field I see a that was Hillary despite all of this that's known they eat or don't know what because they have an expose themselves to media reporting it or they have heard it and are ignoring it\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really awful about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media\nThey'd been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid of reality and truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta having the president whip people up at a rally\nAfter rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this was the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two guys make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally having the president of states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist\nMan oh man where has this guy begin to see Trump\nWhipping people up at a rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can get but you've got\nAll kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiter you obviously listen well Mr\nAcosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho is doing these body slammed moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is look at it from nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand name was what the media they love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she's done to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nToday saying that Trump is recommending and praising ... ... ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up\nTo this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you do it I really didn't want to see what you're ... you're not just fun and with the dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with\nYou so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you'll let somebody throw it back on them and it said guy give a disgrace that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who would like to do\nI think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say Russia's probably by being met for news radio one thousand gang\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy or larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and a hundred thousand dollar or larger life policy did you know\nYou can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy and the cold hard cash I Know the economy's been a struggle for many people need cash they need it right away and you can get cash right away for your life ... if you're over Seventy five you have a one hundred thousand dollar or larger life\nAlmost you know I Want you to write this number down give these folks who call it's all free get rid of those insurance premium stopping those turn that policy and a cash right this number down eight four four we buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever color eight for war\nFor W.

Clinton says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack\nPlans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past and kind of helped out in that regard\nBy campaigning to promise to do this that and the other to get an office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've had Republicans who are elected properly intend to David David able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to

Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president has it anymore\nBut what is troubling as to look behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as far as to who believes [noise] and he does it I think because it's still works do rile people up divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump traumas he's pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools am Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spend golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's been so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to want peace that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk ... brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science ... Williams cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind\nAnd his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from his peas every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs\nThe U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased princes five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs a surrogate larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday left just pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does\nIt's folks [noise]\nNothing every leftist hates America but the leftist either no\nRight to alert or at Yale they do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectual\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they hate\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all\nHe doesn't have any ...\nExcept getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself invents and uses\n[noise] I'll tell you this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the king of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity they but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\n\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blunt they hate\nHe is certainly David America is decent than exceptional\nMay hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have have serious problems\nWith me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people\nAre just not right and everybody has to you you get some way to you know nobody can be that kind of an\nOpen I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this a you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand\nThey love the quid vacation they love people see the post sign tip things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate\nCertain the especially when the conflict with their own\nNow back to Trump's lack constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for an ever\nHe never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy like swimming doesn't see the need to apologize for sometimes\nHe's treated women disgraceful late for which Americans left and right or ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the ... of ... constrained average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad other nations\nBut on the other hand many of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\n[noise] the difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nWhether they love are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory ham the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up we'll get other lying to themselves about the future you're going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she is bragging talking about the
