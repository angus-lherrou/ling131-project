I like football watched it and all of them but was not really into it but I got caught up\nAs a as a resident of Pittsburgh when that dynasty was warming I got caught up in it\nAnd I was there in Nineteen Seventy five and I just got I I like everybody in that pets are amazing to me that's where I first involved the\nTheory of how the performance of a sports team can have so much impact on the self esteem of the population of a city\nThe lawyers own ... that's ... well they did even before they were they were lovable ... but then when the super bowl years came it hasn't it hasn't dropped off it hasn't it hasn't evaporated in it it is incredible I got caught up in it and that's why I became a Steelers fan but I didn't ...\nAnd in retrospect I think that the writers of Nineteen Seventy two uh they had some level of characters and some crazy players but to me there that they were the policy back then and the Steelers were the Trump as soon as Frank made that catch out there\nWasn't enough polo see about the rate is\nThe raiders were man sized Kleenex\n[laughter]\nLet me tell you something for people who\nIs this is that this is honestly true\nPeople who have come of age than if you're watching the the NFL of today in the past ten years if you weren't alive or old enough in the sixties and seventies and even the the early part of the eighties\nWatching the NFL you would think the game today\nIn many ways not all but in many ways has become Ropper room compared to the way I'll give you an example I got very little time here but there's a lot going controversy between the Cincinnati Bengals in the Pittsburgh Steelers\nThe Bengals have is linebacker number fifty five ... perfect to purposely try standard people and he purposely tried to injure number eighty four Antonio Brown again last Sunday for arms to to help but should have been suspended but wasn't leagues tired as suspending him\nWell after that\nAfter a bad place shortly after Ross burgers says he's going to get under center and birth ... points lumber Nineteen ju ju Smith ... says your next\nAnd rival is burger says we can't have that in this guy saying your next should be suspended in the seventies you can take somebody's head off with a with a close line I forearm clothes line\nUp and it was just the way the game what they've really they've really toned the game down I'm not advocating one or the other I'm just I'm just saying that the modern NFL is somewhat reflective of the snowflake culture of today it's still a Burlingame do not anybody misunderstand me but it isn't the game it was in the Seventy\nSeven billion holding back and then you need to know Russia I beat Mitt were news radio on\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness if possible you could add a trio the relation one of the leading causes of syrup mind out before too late with cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device than just Ninety nine dollars to order is a cardiac ... then you have hate\nOur D.

Clinton a two time loser wants to go for the trifecta and I'm telling you there are a lot of people in the Democratic party hierarchy particularly in the media who don't\nWant her anywhere near a presidential campaign again\nKamala Harris big walk by the time the microscopes get to her we're going to find out how really intellectually vacant that woman actually is and the same thing with Cory Spartacus Booker\nThese people survive on the image and reputation built by the drive by media but when the time comes to find out what really goes on between their ears you learn that it isn't much\n\nThey're frustrated because they've tried everything they can they get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has thrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with failure\nThey have failed in every at tempt every effort\nTo get Donald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and the twenties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle [noise] and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty\nFour seven and the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive\nBy media working with the Democrat Party was going to get rid of\nDonald Trump and yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I don't think what this has been about as simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for removed from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that's what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat\nBase and I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really and it's all\nBeen about having Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together and determined this man's not fifth they they want him out of office every day now the failure\nCompounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls the Ford\nThat was a two for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls the four Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then touted as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes\nThat was an issue that was ever investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nThe shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nAnd the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star or did they turn camera hog into and where is he now and where\nIs the issue of gun control where is this story that young people\nHigh school and college students in had enough of them are going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the on Iraq where\nIs that today what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or reveal what do you mean Russia's sitting under a long long he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David Hawk doesn't have an audience David ... did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal ... these people do not have\nConnections with an audience they don't have connections with Boehner's like Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog women we want to see it in Albany saying where's hog\n\nThat's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is\nThis is real

Lewinsky she was an adult she was consenting adults jihad Maya ... she was at consenting adults I knew what was\nThe story the or support thousand migrants fled their lives of poverty and violence in the Central American country with the hope to make if they were ... nothing about this is organic you look Trump's right to ask who's paying for it is who is buying the food\nWho is buying the water

go I\nI've been way back before that even fell a but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get the call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say that these are smarter than than I Am\nNavy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding his own with\nFour thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump pass a bill for wall that Trump really can't stop these people to Trump therefore as ineffective those people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't done that he has promised and that's the that's the uh no that's exactly right and right there that's\nFor in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution than these things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in\nThe Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that ball\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's a lot of other things\nThat they didn't want that he's he's a he's come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that\nTrump was not to be ongoing or a before now I I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets\nI think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on the part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side but we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a ... left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince he flew

that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that when did\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of mine is one of us\n\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children from their mothers ads and this guy\nWho's up to speed on this stuff's as Russia's pictures look past come on you know the pictures are made up this is okay arrest the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for just rushed the pictures look bad we've got to do something pictures Louis oh my gosh\nI I was the guy was smart enough to know that he was falling for a media trick\nBut they're the pictures with what he was telling me was I Can't defend this I have people complain to me about Trump's separating ... I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming through U. L. quick oh this is the soundbite from the hands of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew them\nBut there are four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectively like this ... if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a advantages Julie ... cohost out there talking to fame Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my combat\nThan deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front the half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house for very much in jeopardy\nYou are not buying into his or her syndicated are they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't tell those but I Do I mean I run a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats has another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats to replace Tony ... everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through that I see this is the stuff that is going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally abs and um\nThe Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes those rights in times it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look at the presidential polls in two thousand sixteen I mean that those people all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand four team and the election of two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone\nMaybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to do with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them [noise]\nBut anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage an anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is does the Democrats are not when the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that was over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed\nAgain I acknowledge house races are not the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance\nShannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the strategy\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the predominant ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve killed and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my\nPoint it's not a single poll not a single poll shows so\nFrom this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die bottom\nThey're gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after\nNot too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree but I'm a I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think there's a lot of people not being contacted up next Kaylee Mac a
