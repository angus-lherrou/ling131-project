everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at night time that the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten\nWasn't inflammatory just say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they liked her doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to end up their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on substantive grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets ...\nIt's wide none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stopped in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of eight presidents and it's so predictable because they hate the president will do and then they can to get rid of him they've spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him\nThey're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger\nAnd if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link at the Trump\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can't even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump\nBecause we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for ...\n[noise] and then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted\nFor being anti war many anti anti black anti

all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll liked it and he's most just sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal

pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down toward\nThis thing happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need more gun control\nI mean how many more things to happen before they realized it more gun control law cancer not putting someone with the gun the can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about\nGuns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech accept\nYou can't say this you can't say that's kept but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us left us [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in East Africa but but but but but but we're all for freedom as we define it he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit seem\nSo a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question\nA drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nLaws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise and tell you this guy's got loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here\nAnd that would be Trump as an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway the reporters as Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws this\nOr gay G okay on line on high hearts radio ... by the lobbies is Russell

never politics never came current events dead but not politics\nLet me ask you this was a thing I mean it was getting some of 'em are in your opinion and you said you've got some experience for the Hollywood types in Europe parents that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic\nWhen it comes to it when it comes to Israel they\nWhen they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but could could have said that they were I mean because what I say\nThat yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had but nothing else\n[laughter] well there was one of the reason I ask you about specific question was because many people do not understand how\nA liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThe ... it it it it it's it's a Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\nBecause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if I had the religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with\nLiberal and Israel comes out now with the disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel's doing that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel is a book because if their entire religion that's big\nI mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how\nMany different flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but\nYeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian too um I don't see\nThem as necessarily being seeing Islam\nBut I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I got\nThis ... that's exactly right and this is where this is all headed this is all headed toward atheism anti God that's exactly what is the unifying the people on the left whatever they claim

everything else that you say that you are\nThe all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's any Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about\nIt so this has been in Pittsburgh than it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I mean it doesn't I I I don't I don't\nFeel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews and the way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I think that this is these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I\nAnd I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything silly like that\nGlad you because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think

drive by the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened\nOn Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American laughter people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for\nTrump I have I have an entirely different fits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday talk shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people do abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and they put on this is that this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting they're asking the president\nWhat he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the ... going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes place to ... says\nWhat's the president's gonna do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nOn ... radio Roger you fight 'em offices abroad ... higher risk back from one visit pulse and tax dot com [noise]\nHere we go soundbites eight eight eight and nine just to illustrate what happened on ABC yesterday here is stepping up\nAcross social media speech an anti Semitism are rampant and on the rise all against the backdrop of the ugliest political climate in modern times at the center and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nTraditional norms of civility they do not a Trump is a reactionary he's reacting to the way they treat him\nYeah there may be\nBlamed to go around on both sides here but for the media just totally claim they've got nothing to do with this is absurd now here's Matthew Dowd this guy formally and George W.\nBush Republican now he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to read us a much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Methodist\nOh yes he says oh Trump's false all of this is Trump's fault\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they damn why don't want to think they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but they don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time it seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search who a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and Mary Jordan of the Washington\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of murder\nAnd he also has a lot of the reason why the murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible\nFor fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for ... looking at him as a murder we didn't say that no we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to do murder\n[noise] [laughter]\nNo they are so that

against Trump with a GOP that's a story about\nThe synagogue [noise] ABC Trump at the center of all the political violence right now something they cannot be established something they cannot be proven but yet there is reported as fact\nGleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] [noise] you know\nI I don't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the international\nPolitical expert at what have you\nAnd I used to think of the guy as a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance thinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nGone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of ... ... people ask me what what what happened to Max Boot [noise] and now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah come\nPortman just isn't present control you know the usual complaints from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber form rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other van and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart what it says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue in the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people\nAnd institutions that we admire and respect under attack I mean every day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder\nWherever it happens they are politicizing the whether Republicans\nHave been called murderers by the Democratic party and willing accomplices in the media Mr boat simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism successfully or why\nThe mainstream maybe is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media reporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual\nIt certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and are you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected\nPrecisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understandable in one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists\nAnd you just don't talk about him that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about them that way but Trump dead\nAnd so they all start laughing I think this guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks and then the\nA poll came out then they saw Trump waiting and I say ... is not going to last this craziness Trump\nKept slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a land back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want\nTrump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they thought this is to sift it\nCan't happen at Camp David ... you'd never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive with\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silent ...\nAnd that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that I\nOr anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and\nHe is doing in corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election\nI don't care how much power you think I've got I couldn't come close to doing what was done and has been done in the past two years\nIncluding the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lies five times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof the Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for\nTwo years Mr boot for two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion they were hoping\nThey were hoping and they live every day with the ideas are going to wake up and that the smoking gun was going to fall into their lab but they knew\n\nThat there was any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on\nThe FBI the D. O. J. they knew the tricks being played and they willingly\nSupported those tricks they ignored the real collusion and reading of elections on the part of a Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC I don't care what kind of power use think we've got over\nHere and conservative media but we couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent\nCoup using the upper reaches of power at the department of justice all Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists\nWe no way we wouldn't have the power to plant spies in that campaign of a presidential campaign that we opposed there is no way any of us\nCould rise up a phony document purported to be real intelligence claiming that Hillary didn't despicable things on a bad in Moscow and go get a fire some warrant to spy on the Hillary can't there's no way any of us in the in the conservative media couldn't come\nClose to doing anything that has become a natural everyday occurrence on the ... you want to talk about extremism and this this so called magic goal of ... to brainwash what\nHappened in the past two years in the mainstream maybe brainwashing the American people do you do now\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I Wanna I Wanna I Wanna ask a question here when Robert Mueller does not come up with the goods when when it is finally admitted\nOr alleged that Donald Trump did not to load glued with the Russians and he didn't cheat steal the election how many crazies on the left are going to go bonkers when they hear this meaning how many people in this country to this day at this moment still believe\nThe trumps stolen the election he worked with putting on the Russians to do it and it's only a matter of time and why do they think this because the media has assured them that it happened for two years\nWith the constant reporting of anonymous sources weeks here leaks there James combing manufacturing weeks to get a special counsel appointed\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they sat this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the\nFarrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of orange security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this went with it and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make that because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive they never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to that all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where's it it's absurd where where's that hadn't yet\nMy thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school since that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the ... the lapses you'll you we we have gun free zones schools now you can't put gums ... only people get in with guns or the bad guys you people up [noise]\nUm the left thinks that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left is the problems all the presidents of guns mean [noise]\nNah nope lucky targets you know he's having gobbled up give away\nSaturday in November when your share of over one hundred and fourteen thousand dollars cash in front of the winters will be drawn every hour match to tiles and you couldn't win Maxwell care isn't hers apple launches one thousand dollars cash and much more\nEvery day using here's our guard held ms ...

than any way up here is what I called my final summation that happened on friday about why we're suspicious of the drive by media and the left in general\nThey have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results two thousand sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop I don't need to be told or reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of the ...\nI Know they're psychology I Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just folks\nBeside themselves that everything they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked so given that this is the sum total of intelligence guided by experience I don't believe\nNot going to believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense ethical thing to do but they've brought this on\nAll of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order
