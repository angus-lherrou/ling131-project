{"month": "10", "state": "OK", "station": "KTOK", "content": "The [noise]\nThe [noise]\nMoney [noise]\nRadio [noise]\nNow back to more safe money radio with your host Larry Colton\nWelcome back I'm Derek ... your host of safe money radio I'm a save money retirement specialist working with science right here and the Oklahoma City area\nSo here's a question I'd like to ask you how much of your money is currently in the market and all of us fifty percent eighty percent [noise] did you make a conscious decision to have that particular percentage\nExposed market risk or did it did it just sort of a happen\nWhy am I asking well as I've said before the markets go up and as we all know they come back down how much of your life savings that is exposed to market risk is a very important consideration and that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think of their money in terms of red money and green money\nThose terms might sound funny but but I think they'll help but help us understand a very important concept so let me explain red money is money that we're willing to expose to market risk in\nHopes of a higher return we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains red money has exposed the upside and downside market risk with green money were not willing to accept the risk of loss\nSo we're willing to accept a lower return and exchange green money does not have downside market risk\nSo Fred money's exposed upside an downside market risk and green money has only upside market potential which one is better well uh-huh that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad at it all depends\nThey're very important question we should ask ourselves with these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be angry money\nIf you're at or near retirement you should ask yourself if any of your money should be in red money I mean can you afford to lose any of your retirement funds\nWould you rather take two steps forward and three steps back or just take one step at a time and never take a step back\nWell that's what we do here and save

good for the rich the young have time on their side and can afford to lose money in hopes that don't make it back in the future the rich can afford to lose at least some of their money and still live comfortably\nBut if you're at or near retirement you should definitely be in the grain which is money that cannot be lost due to market declines many people believe that all retirement money should be green money personally um I think that makes a lot of sense\nDepending of course on on your situation but many people I work with regardless of age what a hundred percent green money because they know

tremendous sense of comfort and relief for the person making the decision about that the worry the stress goes away just think it'd be I've read many losses and get upset probably the money should not have been in red money\nSo this makes it easy to decide you ask yourself this question if I were to lose some most or all of the money in this account would I be upset\nIf the answer is yes then your money should be in a green money account\nYou may be asking yourself what green money options are there other than cash a check in her savings account and bank CDs\nThat's where I get to help you call

journalist I'm Pam who sell Fox News much of the world wants to know what happened to ... the Washington Post contributor who vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nUh not too many America climate Chris or not the present time as I said look\nI'm this is the story and twenty Eighteen that most folks that would be impossible we've created an economic boom\nPresident's policies that changed the whole incentive structure in the economy we lower tax rates for individuals and small businesses and other companies are we deregulated across the board with spark a tremendous boom and energy which I think it's going to continue for quite some time\nWhat we're also seeing here and this is I think very important in terms of the president's views\nBlue collar workers are booming right now the fastest pace of hiring for the blue collar workers since the Nineteen eighties or what I was first there is a Cub Scout for president Ronald Reagan also another point I Want to make on wages now our wages rising I had a pretty good taste\nBut the blue collar metal and service areas typically a little slower Chris they're actually raising faster than they are white collar workers and I think this is the new face of the Trump pecan and what I call blue collar workers and men and women who own their own small\nBusinesses as I said the incentives that changed the president has ended the war on business ended the war I energy he's ended the war and success is that the people just go out there and take a reputable I've got your back and that's exactly what's happening\nWell he may have started a war with the Federal Reserve the repeatedly called out the Federal Reserve this way for raising interest rates here's just one example of that\nI think the fed is for too stringent and they're making a mistake and the south right [noise] and it's despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do\nBut Larry isn't that exactly what the fed is supposed to do when the economy is going strong to raise interest rates to prevent it from getting too hot and and using a spike in inflation and whatever happened to recognizing the independence of the Federal Reserve as presidents on for decades [noise]\nOr a couple of things I'm Matt I'm by the by there is no spiking inflation respectfully and understand that I thought about that what the fed does to try to prevent it when the economy is going strong and I don't want to see if I can and should look interest rates are two and a quarter percent they're not high [noise]\nWell that's true there's a normalization growing I look at the president as a successful businessman an investor knows a lot about these topics and he's giving his opinion\nAnd his concern is that the fed might moved too quickly and mine choke off the economic recovery I which is now running three to four percent okay he's not impinging on that independence he didn't say I want you to change your plan he didn't say I want you to change your strategy you know that that is then wonder how he\n... he said oh darn sure he didn't order it and you could argue we couldn't order but he did say all of those things he said I think they're they're going crazy loco they're raising rights to hide didn't say that they're raising them to walk too fast\nWell that says you again but but he never sat through the fat change I Want you to change this or I Want you to change that he respects the feds independence and again what the president is raising here on the matter of interest rate timing and so forth a\nLot of people are discussing those people on Wall street people in academia there's a whole lot of news articles this are great it's just way and there's nothing wrong with him weighing in I think the bigger picture is this look at\nThe White House the president the federal\nAnd they want they kinda got Trump wouldn't be president well that was because you had a candidate on the other side who was the one person the Democrats could nominate the Donald Trump could beat it she ran a lousy campaign and her comments the other day about instability and

we ask you for questions for the battle now might got this on Twitter from Troy Carline who tweets\nDoes Trump really thing Kanye West will help him gained support from the African American with the African American vote Julie how to answer\nTry why do you think the president invited reporters and cameras in to see him with Kanye West\nWell I think it's pretty simple I think the president does think that this will help and with African American voters whether it actually does or not I think it's a different question but I think that Trump at\nHis core and someone who really understand the power of a televised moment he understands the power of doing something that's a little off beat this was certainly off beat it was covered widely and\nAgain I Do think that he look at someone like ... and think well it's kind of ... with me then maybe I can get more support among African American voters I actually do think he makes that connection but having covered a lot of politician with a lot of celebrity indoor stars I think that I can safely say that that really doesn't have as much of an effect that sometimes the campaign or a White House thinks that they do\nPresident Trump says that he got substantially more support from African Americans than most Republicans I've gotten over the years\nBut the numbers don't back them up let's take a look and twenty twelve Mitt Romney got six percent of the black vote in ... Mr Trump got eight percent and then in a recent poll twelve percent of African Americans approve of the ... President Trump is doing while eighty five percent disapprove of Britain your thoughts\nAbout ... visit to the oval office and is there any political benefit I think there's probably some modest political benefit look at the ... the\nAfrican American votes of the Democratic party has been monolithic now support that they don't go ... there were monolithic for years\nA Republican can only hope to cut into that a little bit because it is the culturally I think ... the black voters so it's oriented toward the cause of Democrats so this bizarre event and that's what it was a might help a little but only a little is Jewish who just\n[noise] then there was another interesting about this week and that was ... Trump's primetime interview on ABC or first time being interviewed at length here's a clip\nCould say I'm the most ... percent underworld usage you the most boring person was one of them\nYou're not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity ... has just put a strain on your marriage\nIs not considering the progress of mine I'm On my then first lady\nAnd I have much more important thing to think about going to do [noise]\nFelipe you have some experience fair housing advised Hillary Clinton how to deal with some of these questions how do you think a lot of your debt which cringe worthy or\nHer saying that she's one of the most bully people in the world is crunch where they looked at the role of first lady is not a job it's ill defined it is what you make of it and what we've seen of you know the last decade and said the first lady often picks a signature issue for her to pick bullying\nAnd then to sort of disregard the bowling her husband does on a daily basis and then to double down and say that she's the most bullied I'm Sorry that goes from bad joke to just being tone deaf and I I don't know I'm sure that a lot of people saw it and said you're absolutely right\nI'm not sure what the point of it\nBut the point of it may be as this can you imagine\nIf she were the spouse of a Democratic president the door in coverage that she would receive and she has not gotten that\nShe has been treated either ... almost completely ignored she's not on the cover of the big fashion magazines all the way the Democratic first lady looks like her would be um and she's often mocked and ridiculed now whether it makes me among the most bully persons on earth I don't know but the but her complaint is not without at least some basic she gets\nAway with a lot I mean this is a woman who only a few years ago was full on on the birther attack\nAnd she has never been pressed on that ironically she was in Kenya last week the very point where her and her husband were saying that President Obama was supposedly born she's not being pressed on that she's not being pressed particularly on why is your office lying and saying you're just wearing a jacket 'cause you pulled it off the rack and her saying hey\nNot I've seen all kinds of courage of it I didn't get to the office that I Know that\nIs it and it was very widely in and it was more like our coverage when we why why why should we were going to have much to say about ... and we are Carl way and\nI have a slightly different view I thought we saw a strong independent thoughtful caring person\nMaybe she would find a better way to express the negative press that she's got and then building but uh by saw but I saw somebody who people could admire and appreciate\nClearly independent I mean this was a woman who was asked some very tough questions about her relationship with her husband and made it clear that she was in charge and she was going to do what she wanted to do and uh I I thought it was a magnificent a a a time and I'm Glad she did it affect you know they may go don't touch me\nMan [laughter] you're only mean volleyball your boys are I got a when Carl came in the White House he took over Hillary Clinton's office which was a big deal that she had a West Wing office and what was the first thing you did when he took over that also office this is my favorite ... or you want me to tell rapidly\nNot true but go ahead you had an extra says no I didn't I had to point out or if I had a Catholic priest who was a friend of mine who came in and put it in my office and wish me the best so but somehow or another we're now are All right All right or another young people try on it I thought that was a great ... everything's about you isn't it the Clintons then okay why my\nQuestion how is Mrs Trump\nRegarded in the Trump White house I mean we know Hillary was regarded as we know how other parts like Nancy Reagan how was she regarded as she seen people scared of her as she seen is an important advisor to the president wherever she seen in terms of weighing in on policy in style\nShe didn't really interesting thing where she is an innocent industrial she is an important advisor can this president but she does that in her own way she is not a first lady who spent a lot of time in the west wing\nShe is not somebody who at like Michelle Obama dead who developed strong relationships with certain people in the west of Lincoln had people there who are sort of her voice that says more her to the president at in their private time\nBut she does this effort kind of put her in a box and and to find her and I think what we have seen over these last couple of years is that that's really impossible to do because\nOn the one hand she is as strong supporter of her husband as anyone yet she find moments where she is willing to speak out against him in a really public way some of his policy decisions\nSome of the things that he said on Twitter and I think that that's what we're going to hear from her and the next couple of somebody who kind of have to look moment to moment to figure out where she's going to be but but indisputably she is in line with us with this president\nYou up confusion about this I mean that's obviously part of your job is the Chinese and bats that are to be able to report back to Beijing the president's ear\n... honestly I've been talking to US ambassador to other countries you know Washington DC and this is also part of the program\nWho is the final decision maker of costs presumably the president that were

... that are going to the coast of California out to the Gulf of Mexico get so close to the Chinese islands and two so close to the Chinese coast so who is on the offensive quiz on the defensive\nThis is very clear about American ... this is a very good example of American intervention into China's internal affairs\n[laughter] that talk about another flashpoint North Korea does China a gray with North Korean leader Kim Jong on that any steps that he takes towards denuclearization must be match by us concessions on the other side\nAnd what do you how do you respond to allegations even by President Trump that China has relaxed its sanctions against North Korea and has allowing goods to flow into North Korea\nChina has voted in favor of of all the U.N Security council resolutions about sanctions against ... and we're implementing all these rather than we have not ... as long as these resolutions to enforce will implement them ...\nAnd do you think that the United states is right that denuclearization has to happen first or do you agree with Kim that North Korea takes us stop the U. S.

clients\nAre back in two thousand eight and two thousand nine\nInstead of just started recently they feel like failures but you know what they shouldn't there were separate misled by uh the promises of ah some of their friends and the media telling them to work hard and put their money in a mutual fund diversify and everything will be okay\nWhat failed is a promise that never should have been made\nYou know sometimes failure is like an elevator\nRemember when your retirement future is looking bright and it was like riding on an elevator heading right for the penthouse everyday you'd wake up and you'd be on a higher floor in fact your retirement money was probably doing so well you didn't even pay attention to what floor you were on some of you may be in that position right now\nBut then all of a sudden back in a ... you might have failed a sinking feeling you know what I mean we've all felt it when the elevator first starts to drop our stomach goes into our throat\nAnd when the elevator starts going down when it's supposed to be going up it's not a feeling anybody likes ah it's kind of like the unexpected turbulence on your airplane flight\nBefore you know your elevator dropping so fast all you can do is hold on some people are telling you don't worry the market will hit a bottom or you might also here it's this is a great by an opportunity or it's only paper last well that may be the same thing they were telling their clients back in two thousand\nIf the majority of your money was in the market back in a two thousand eight in other words diversified your account to many many years to break even it may not even a broken even yet\nIn fact after considering all the fees that you may have paid as possible your account has actually decreased over the last several years\nThe good news is that the elevator rarely dropped without stopping on a few floors along the way the problem is that hardly anybody ever gets off the elevator or maybe they hope it will start going back up that's kind of like the gambler that's waiting for the next big hand\nCall Derrick now where you are free save money information should have won eight seven seven five for a seat

that could destroy the value of your home investment other properties you don't have the same risks if you own a car about an airplane\nIf you're on an airplane or about my condolences but anyway if

well I have a loan on my home so I have to buy insurance on it well that may be true but one of your home was paid for would you still buy insurance I think you probably would why\nWhether you realize it or not you would buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophic risk catastrophic risk means that you have a chance even if it a small to lose a lot of value in other words money\nIf something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small\nCompared to the last we might incur if a catastrophe happens so for the fun of it let's let's assume you live in a modern home up to current building goes you don't smoke and fall asleep in your bed you don't like candles and leave them unattended\nAnd you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen if I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire even so I bet you have home insurance and the reason is because losing your house\nWould be a catastrophic financial last so the relatively small cost of homeowners insurance is worth paying for am I right well you know I'm right\nBut let me ask you another question why
