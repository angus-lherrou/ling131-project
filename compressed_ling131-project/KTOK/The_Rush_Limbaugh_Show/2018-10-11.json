of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's the end feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question what Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the\nAttorney general for Rocco same all\nInvolved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side ... so called conservative

go low meeting Republicans when they go low we kept them\n\nSo people's mind God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no I didn't mean it literally\nI was saying that we can't take it

encouraging people would get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence\nLet's look at the things that they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe resigned or the poll indicated the house races or over their

what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name is ... ... the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it\nAnd it has\nTo do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then the show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\nA lifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealthy which was made to look like a jet setting party animal by Robin Leach so whether whether Jamal casualties related to him and I couldn't even find out just habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin ... monitors the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ...\nHe is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons\nThere are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son\nHe is the air now Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next ...\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys is winding dined Facebook guy but a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky but he represents if\nHe is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women\nHe's the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them open up being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last night it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the week\nUp Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo to corruption and connections in stores he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm not\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head\nYou don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nYeah so so not only do we have a female passengers traveling with an emotional supports poorly road\nYou know frontier airlines had to\nPoint out the people that we do not allow rodents on our airplanes\nAnd a squirrel I Know they look cute but a squirrel is nothing but a tree rats at all it is it'll cuter face as a bushy tail out there it's a tree rats are rodent and frontier airlines doesn't allow them on their airplanes\nAnd people that were just so mean she needs\nTo support squirrel and I just wouldn't it be great if this is one of these ... lost her mind in Washington over the cabinet and stuff and then there was this\nHudson Valley New York guy arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around election day because he's upset about that country's direction\nNow do you think this guy's going to vote for\nThis guy is obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and finding this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements it'll happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise] right here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters democratic voters want revenge\nNot a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... in the trunk and so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make\nTrump suffer you think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't\n[noise] I don't believe\nThat the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I Am\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is this the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the courts to travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a hit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when there are pros the right lose it when we're silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away at\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works is if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win a landslide because\nThey know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make it not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans of conservative stand up went every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up and convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engage when you saw that was\nI was right in

we going to do that when they told us that we didn't have to pay [noise]\nThing of El Al wow\nThey pretty much stay [noise]\nHis administration who he does not like echoing remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it\nDuring a live phone interview Thursday morning with facts and friends the president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington that he'd distrust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... there's just not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance\nSo ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump\nCalling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little lead other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected by it we had it under great control I don't think really\nBig was hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it dead and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so\nThe next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney general said they go low we kick them and the whole room Mr\nPresident started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's willing to discuss things safe and for him to make a very dangerous day for older what has held in contempt by Congress\nColder when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to be totally do like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans in Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge or or they would say\nWe strongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely unilaterally condemn it\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I he better be careful what he's wishing for\nNow the stock market's been kind of the song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks\nThere are a number of wealthy Democrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would they would encourage some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president is not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking our\nPolling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market's a roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy\nI'm paying interest at a high rate because of our head and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation\nHe is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and ...\nOh I Can't I mean so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time totally unnecessary for it right before the election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing\nPrevious Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the you know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions and I've got a pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it they said there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react to it and\nAnd this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster\nI think there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I Am a not at all with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nThere have been some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not only that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest
