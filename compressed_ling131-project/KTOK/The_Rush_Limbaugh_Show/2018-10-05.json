she was I have now seeing\nPhotos anyway Grassley said on Fox in France this morning if there is evidence in the FBI report than other witnesses were leaned on by allies of ball before it as well not

was fifty one to forty nine\nMansion flight\nAnd Collins all voting yes but the final vote cannot happen\nBy Senate rule\nBefore for forty two pm eastern time tomorrow has to be thirty hours after

the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comment and it's not just on social media but so the officers that so many\nRepublican senators are getting their being day Lou used\nTheir entire families are being threatened their grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened it's enormous\nIt is never ending the funds don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in is on the end used it is vile and it is evil and it's not just like\nAn Collins and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have\nTo be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous\nPressures flake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mobs squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote and the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because\nOf the abject real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted and they're still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this is his final term\nOr the easy thing to do here would be the vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats that he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked viciously he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan

months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America I'm away from its intentions and it's designed this founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration looked into it in the Snow White Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America man so why don't you\nClaim that man was taking on issues like climate change\nAnd health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist fact\nLook and there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller de Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taken\nA [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the grounds as to what you see [noise] even though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify a some kind of socialist\nThan women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjured up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want to power around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons at tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want 'em to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it\nOr try to become conversant and it just the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just targeting\nCapitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence base here\n\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett

own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\n[noise] another poll quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic American ideal\nOf white male privilege\nBecause Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long\nPole why did he blah burned like a newborn he

minorities and women and Latino sent this span excluding gays lesbians transgendered don't you know this has been a lifelong ... strategy\nNo one's why why why make an announcement three o'clock you voted yes\nTo continue the process you voted yes on the procedural vote there can be only one reason to call a three o'clock announcer say you're going to vote no after after suggesting that process go forward you shut down the process a I realize a lot of people think that that's what's so that that's what's in store here\nAnd of course I'm hearing is going to happen I'm hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing\nThat she's going to do this after this program ... and ... I mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly has absolutely things that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I Am going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone through many first hours this week without

McClain who you were just speaking of the person they contacted Amish Kaiser on and trying to get her to possibly change your testimony ... uh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nA sheep in those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring we wouldn't Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and the testimony she she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was that and that's the last known address of of this marker McLean\nCorrect yes as a ... absolutely that when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with my client yet\nSo here's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes that hasn't come out yet [noise] I I'm Wondering if not the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nAre going to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote\nChanges it suddenly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nAnd it's not about to come out that's the whole point you\nKnow it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser\nA pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference to that end Grassley said there's a lot more there are many more examples of balls he poured witnesses being pressured to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not gonna change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence and if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it baby CBS NBC began to report all this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate vote\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle\nWell the question is why wouldn't republic drift make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy was it made an effort to uh uh [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see it if the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report\nThey discovered that much\nTo my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth they are not mentioned what we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense\nYou were sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the Boise foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury supporting perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not showing up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being

alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is animated\nThis week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might have Senator Feinstein and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by E N Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grassland his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you was shortly one producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so\nYou are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations I don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWell her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegations she passed the legislature and we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nSome reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't producer\nAnd Grassley saying you must be you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy and now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my wife and three Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating represented ... what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time you spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever\nI mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of college out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken\nSenators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules and and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept them running back to the microphone don't have been to the senator or the\nThe media people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab wanting a soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass me with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd wash but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen the election is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to\nConfirm judges Kevin on the floor\nThat was during his or Senate floor remarks today in favor of capital he was even singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth heat up I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nI may have to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got an email last night from Salinas veto\nWho has made a name for herself by traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaigns season of two thousand sixteen she went through all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously she went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this but she wanted to find\nOf who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see\nAnd rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there an anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a known from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there\nIn these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed\nThat if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day and that they did sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly that\nAfter a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nA welcome back to have you with Russia and\nThe service\nOf humanity and hundreds who ate in

Feinstein Kamala Harris\nI'm telling you this party the Democratic party and adjust world would suffer the biggest mid term electoral defeat in this nation's history they deserve for this country

again so I figured there must be\nAnd in announcing her definite no she said he is just not the right man for the Supreme Court right now just not the right man\n[noise] [noise]\nSo Kimberly stressful now she changing you're not changing she is saying that her mind made up\nThe wing is a Reuters story and it says essentially Murkowski has not\nMade a wrinkle decision you could have fooled me it sounded awfully final to me this morning when I read that Brett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate\nRight now\nNow she's saying it's not her final decision\nSomething is happening in that regard [noise]\nHere Kimberly ... tweets again the first one here well they're they're both right on the money just to be clear yeah I'm trying to apple five days\nI'm I'm trying to make sure more people hear about these tweets and then we'll see them yeah absolutely\nIt's worth it Kimberly straw so Wall Street journal columnist editorial page editor and writer\nJust to be clear on what Lisa Murkowski voted for today Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted to legitimize and sign off on the most this pick a boat tactics ever in the Supreme Court nomination\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted today\nJust stand with Diane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or\nDoing [noise] the other interesting thing has other do develop it here but hang on to a second there is a second tweet from Kimberly stressful\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska today voted\nTo abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially leave the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block\nWhich puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state development property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right\nOn the money\nLegitimizing in signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dastardly and and a number of other things just just\n[noise] not much redeeming there but\nMore importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed accord stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing\nChanges\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals\nWouldn't be the highest ranking court that could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic\nTo put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals with a bunch of a leftist in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot\nAll to supposedly\nBe in unison with me too movement\n[noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos\nWere taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked ... wardrobe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUm you know just something that makes you go the other quiet\n... wait wait wait a minute the stroke of a saint pick what could go away\nWell if the stroke or the pen can but Anwar and fight for this day\nOh oh you mean Trump could cancel and war as pay back the Murkowski for going against capital\nYes sir it wouldn't do it oh okay I'm\nToo many people will be hurt too many people be hurt by\nYour right but that that means a lot for her and her state\nSo I don't know um the other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately impeachment hearings which started against Trump\nBut it would most likely include Kavanaugh what does that did it for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nBack and play you mean to be impeached as well\nAbsolutely sir\nNo no no that that wasn't that much off um get rid of cabin on getting back off the bench\nOr install Trump's next nominees when the White House and twenty twenty\nI in fact I think my guess is that they would go after capital of first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings fresh\nAnd everybody's minds go after him on her juror\nRainy and sexual harassment\nNot I mean serious serious things for which\nA conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capital then they added all the other things on Trump is my guest that they would go after Kavanaugh first ... ... ... ... state would leave alone that Gorsuch\nShift the balance of the court cabin on does\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety an act of Congress creates Yosemite National
