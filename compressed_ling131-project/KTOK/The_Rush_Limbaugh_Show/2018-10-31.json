mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's down on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral

has been\nTo transform America away from\nThe traditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point

energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood into a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching\nMedia responsibility to the actions of people even notice how quickly they want to do bad\nNotice how quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not

whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are a vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon sad or Monday Night also that he

just trying to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN they were there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in the last

habit\nThat it was is assuming an operating on the assumption ... whenever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf the momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline than wire Trump's rallies still ... over the he's got one in Fort Myers like in Fort Myers\nYeah Ford myself thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlanned between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election and he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy\nReviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties know what is messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh attitude\nOr anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped

have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe what do you not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close I mean we don't know we never know until the aftermath here's Trump tweeting out at\nPaul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something you know nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing\nTrump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets and his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why\nIsn't why isn't it when he isn't it a problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\n\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today [noise]\nSpeaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford with her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin all was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's names of the Supreme Court he is the passes it gets ... got the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kevin all of a such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get one of those guys are rubber rate serial rapists where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political slant\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital of us accused of being was actually cruise they would not have stopped at him being confirmed and the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching\nKevin why aren't they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin all of us will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house so why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions the reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media is doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true\nIt was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is none of what they were saying about capital of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring mostly for up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kevin on but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy make humbling eyes or if I Do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nHis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office if you have the debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents they still opposed Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win\nI became an ... so I got one just for the heck of it and I use it every now and then um for the fun of it but for people to

teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession was becoming mine that I can handle I started writing my class called courses because I couldn't handle how they had Wi Fi American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nIntegration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our ... come on in the way it Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nIs specially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called ... coal mine you will automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were a strong and we're not when dead\nNow wants to ship Dr performed his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing that check coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back they ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quick not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong\nYou realize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to you to tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who could work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets with tape with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one ... streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will have a lot of everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shut it to think about kind of history he's going to be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books oh wow you know very was because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history buffs all revised they get even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nDid a survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in referenced Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in and American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard's in as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a ... a socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause of immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process we were much newer and younger country but um\nAnd we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people have been brainwashed in propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes now let's go to the audio sound like this this folks I talked\nAbout this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by a hundred protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his thoughts on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protest or not support what one does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump first lady\nEvocative Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shit like\nThat\nYou\nKnow they can reach drinker and go to Jen\nThank you so much [laughter] I Can't keep happening chances\nYou will not see this on any network newscast you will not see that video on any news channel anywhere\nThank you thank you President Trump that you will block it thank you we love you thank you for coming thank you very much no thank you sir you're the best the best great job thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake your hand serve thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper said the protest they're not surprised nobody wanted the president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your sham should my thought this was not your place you know business going they don't want you to forty five thousand people signed a petition asking him not to come\nOh wait we're not true we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center\nAnd now I'm a lot of the first lady and is Monica Trump gets a love to\nThank you parents meaning from I don't\nThink your grandma she had her name is John John you've paid me ... [laughter]\nThat was a male employee looking at Jared Kushner's thing nobody ever heard of you laughing that his wife was a\nBigger star that's fine no problem everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program but this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants to not all Trump anywhere she everybody hates Trump everybody's spices Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait to vote for Democrats\nSo the Trump can't do anything and everybody wants to Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you get a reaction to real people you will not see those videos you will not hear that audio and\nReduce the number one talk radio personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh muggy on the\nNews radio one down\nFive

Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle was published\nThe book was the first collection of home story which Conan Doyle has been publishing in magazines is Eighteen eighty seven he was born in Scotland and study medicine and the University of Edinburgh where he met Dr Joseph Dell\nA teacher with extraordinary conduct of power bill partly inspired to his character Sherlock Holmes years later this week in Nineteen fifty Twenty one year\nOh the Pearl Lloyd becomes the first African American to play in an NBA game when he takes the court in the season opener for\nThe Washington Capitals two other black players joined the NBA that season the Celtics drafted Chuck Cooper and the second round and the New York Knicks gotten that sweet water Clinton from the Harlem Globetrotters but the Nixon Celtics didn't start their seasons until a few days later\nThis week in Nineteen fifty seven the Japanese car company Toyota establishes a U.S headquarters in\nAn old ramblers dealership in Hollywood, California\nToyota executives hope to saturate the Americans second car market with their small and relatively inexpensive twelve pet crown sedans it took until the mid sixties for the company to gain a respectable chunk of the American market and in Nineteen Seventy five Twitter became the best selling import brand in the United states\nAnd this week in Nineteen Ninety a hundred and thirty two feet below the English Channel workers drill and opening the size of a car through wall of rock this was no ordinary hold it connected the two ends of an underwater tunnel Lincoln Great Britain with the European mainland for the first time in more than a thousand years the channel tunnel or channel costs Fifteen\nBillion dollars deployed nearly Thirteen thousand workers took over four years to complete passenger service started on may six Nineteen Ninety four\nThat's your look back at this week in history first\nTo do it a month ago CNN declared the Democrats have won the house because of one of their polls [noise] in the poll loves is declaring victory in the battle of the house\nShe was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night and set up until that I wouldn't have said in the election were held today we were when but what I'm saying now as we will when we when we will win the house\nNancy Pelosi\nPredicting the house has already been won by to divert so no need\nThe Democrats there are a lot of kids in this country who didn't have a parent to their baseball games\nOr recitals because their parents were serving in faraway places\nBut now their parents are coming home from battle some with wound you can see then some with loans you can see like post traumatic stress disorder\nEveryday wounded warrior project assists wounded warriors and their families with the warriors to work program a program that helps warriors translate their military experience to civilian job experience and they help employers find the right warrior for the right job\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten\nWhen the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand\nTen I mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because I'm so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when that happened you should've seen in if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats the left\nWas done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day and I got to read the whole thing it prints out there for pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch and I'm going to\nTell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone is midterms that her final stretch\nTo twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half that's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day about the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that paid the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't bother any sober mind that the elections\nAnalyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the

days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this\nYou're there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's given you every reason in the world is ... ... to ... you can think of where they're not that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval it is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president is job approval is that a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race and there are likely a lot\nSo Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things [noise]\nAnd then the next burger how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been the massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia seven\n\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seek but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't the ... thing and then the next ...\nAre we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next one is early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we now is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise]\nSo the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so what going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate go competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh film [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem\nI suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of prices regardless of whether that happens\nWe are well set up for such an eventuality bottom line I happen to live is the idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognizes one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea\nIt's all free collie three three Seventy trade\nThey will even throw into free tickets to an upcoming workshop so you can ask questions and learn more\nCali three three Seventy T.
