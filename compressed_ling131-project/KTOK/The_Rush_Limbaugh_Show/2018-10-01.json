thing is just amazing he says he\nWas bullied behind stage uh by the Saturday Night live crew in staff saying come on man you can't wear the Trump pat and he wore the Trump pac man\nAnd then he gave a you know a pro Trump speech that was edited out of the uh out of the show but on the way back\nHe tweets on his on his airplane or just him in the Trump had and he tweets something about ah you know we got to abolish the thirteenth amendment and the left goes crazy\nAnd they're just all about how is he was during sleep see that's what Trump people are like they want to bring slavery back really\nReally you don't play that game I can understand that from conservatives but do me a favor I just want you to Google thirteenth amendment Huffington Post see how many stories come up\nThat is not about abolishing slavery that is about saying that we never abolished slavery but the thirteenth amendment was just a ruse then we went from the plantation to the prisons\nThat's what that meant he's talking about prison reform\nAnd everybody on the left knows it every one movie\nBecause he has the Trump had uh they're gonna act act as if that is that I Am so American guy was labor on slavery which is just so dishonest and I've always felt that it is interesting that that the thirteenth amendment did not\nOutlaw slavery as an either slavery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime wherever the party has been convicted shell exist when the United states or any place a subject of their jurisdiction\nSo it is it does make that James ... um that you if you commit a crime and you're in prison then you ... you can have to work under those circumstances\nUm which is something that we all kind of understand is kinda bad I mean there's nothing that I mean you're making a license plates whatever you're doing this stuff it there's nothing bad it shouldn't have been called slavery should have been abolished\nAnd there should be a an amendment that says that you know you have this but this is this is eight and activists are exactly right and where the people who are for prison reform for\nA you know letting people out of prisons are saying that basically your arresting black people to get them to be delayed correct you could still be with the correct them that this is this is\nPost modernist a nonsense to the\nNth degree and in case you're wondering if a lot of people are thinking all Kanye West the conservative he's got this guy had on yeah but you like some of the stuff Trump is doing but this is not a conservative argument by any means you have an ideological conservative\nNo more but he is I mean that's his language of saying we need prison reform alegria I think we need prison reform to and the generic statement right yeah they're not perfect\nBut he's using the reason why the left is getting away with a you know making his tweet look races is because they they know this language he's using their language\nRight and again shows that they don't care about the issue as much as they care about political power the fact he's supporting their far left viewpoint yes right this is is echoing a far left rally in quite a crowd of activists yet and they'd rather traction because of the ...\nRight that shows the depth of the right and this is all about power again it's\nNot about the principal you think you think the left cares about prison reform Kanye West and his wife have done now more with Donald Trump on prison reform than a lot of presidents have done a lot of celebrities\nThey're more interested in killing his career

center President Trump is talking about new trade deal with Canada and Mexico he says the fat cells mistakes and NAFTA and also opens markets to us farmers and manufacture\n\nSo we're renegotiating NAFTA Canada Canada which then they want to know part of it they asked in the last moment hey don't forget us can we be finding this to prompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just me and the parents jumpstart hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\nRemember\nHow to drive ... and the Democrats and the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods\nWasn't going to provoke the child comes it couldn't possibly be good at might mean the end of what ever Rangel or making what the North Koreans\nIt might destroy existing good relations with the child comes up up breaking news China just cut import tariffs on a wide range of products China\nBut can't comes we'll cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the tri calm finance ministry yesterday\nThe check comes a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partner such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits for Amri ordinary American\nWho makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do and it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than the throughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour\nThe pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes I'm In an extended\nStatement\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing the deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are\nClueless uh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in a short now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we shouldn't feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs\nIn their careers including farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has the chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as a noun Singh is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking about I got scared to death\nAt lesson has been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us\n[noise] [noise] this kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr ... or in the\nRespect of others it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world

president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying\nTrickster isn't skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party which uh\nWe do with all the

Blumenthal ... find that uh what do you live with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how the world did Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein\nWeek because it was it ... we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and that she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people\nWere trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer it's fair it starts button light\nAnd it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other one you have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who was seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually\nAsk for a point of order the chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegation that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff at any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her and she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them\nAnybody here to leak it she turns or did you look at the you'd look at ... she turns back to the camera\nWomen awake at Mr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy saying oh is this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets a turn to her staff and ask them and they deny it and that's it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and ask to undergo his seven FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your late this letter and nice loan nor nor was it was with us\nShe turns back around so we we

questions and what we had one through four\nOf them here and here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin on things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls polls are aren't very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's going to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my

that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the

spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake nose claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI ice go because you see there are things to find the Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump ... I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK\nThank you Mr herself it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks ago so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n[noise]\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do

this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nThe Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing\nDidn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to

not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why

lake Eyre is what it is [noise]\nRight here at my formerly nicotine same fingers in New York Times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one\nNecessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said at his press conference today where he's\nNow I don't want to limit anything I said I thought that this that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not\nThat fake news so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting invested in which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells FBI interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty

on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed delay and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named it somehow insufficient\nAs somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump\n... but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller they stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start bouncing\nFor the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no collaboration and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not\nSomebody look we got a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack 'em in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked more on this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been Rand is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it either no such thing but he sure fell for the bait\nI Am not limited to thing I've totally FBI
