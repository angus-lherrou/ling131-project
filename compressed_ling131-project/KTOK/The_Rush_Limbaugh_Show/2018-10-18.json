this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks\nYou know I read my tech blog news I read everything there\nAre still people attempting via they're\nReporting to suggest that there was a recording\nOf the murder of ... from his apple watch\nMy friends this\nIs item number one but a rousing as my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ... out there called apple\nInsider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this in certain Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any\nRelation any any complicity in this story\nSo whoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by the show is apple watching her now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been\nMisappropriated and has been falsely accused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data and the biggest\nOne the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple in well actually uh fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watched they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operate it would still get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self said well he didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch\nFailed to do it just ceased to be a slave\nTo the phone the other two ways or blow to and wife ... those are the three\nWays that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim it was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to it this week by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations being able\nTo monitor and over here and steal signal there's no\nWay that the Bluetooth component of a watch would be able to permeate the protection of an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's that couldn't happen so he only under way would be why\nBut that one only work if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on one\nJust because the phone connects to why when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because the phone it's parents who uses it\nThen like if you're at home you're ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range\nIf you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that he was probably know to do it um\nI don't know that they would give them the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find that the idea that that watch was recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud is just so outside the realm of possibility\nAnd he has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording exist that it's somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish officials are doing\nEverything they can to listen to it and make decisions and the sharing of the United states if there is a recording of this I'm not denying that they couldn't easily been a recording of the ... the Saudis made themselves but non fruit to showcase watch that just it I don't see how in the world\nThat Trump will not\nJoined the chorus and pull out of anything was sort of stop the arms deal stop depending on what I'm saying these people are there was none of this concern over what happened to our ambassador and three other people and ...\nAll of this is about embarrassing Trump it's not even really about Saudi reformers just saying that it is this is just the latest vehicle that they think they can get in and drive toward the destination of ruin nation of Donald Trump ...

are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember we had a call here at this maybe\nThree weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs\nWe saw Trump yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nPossible that camp that camp that says it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened also includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death of these maniacs and\nThat's why yard signs of not being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of the yard\nSigns are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid

become a gigantic\nDemocrats constituency so big so large that it would dwarf anything to Republicans could put up even if they got all of the white working class well we know how it turned out Obama continued to preside over Democrats losing elections all over this country\nWell Mr Thomas Bee and saw ... years back [noise]\nAnd this piece is in the New York times and the headline the Democrats left turn is not an illusion this result we didn't think it was\nA there is nothing [laughter] there's nothing about the stark raving mad aspects\nOf today's Democratic Party that is an illusion is all\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why when the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not that illusion they want you to know they want\nReaders to notice left turn is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub bad like many overnight sensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties in the Soviet Union if you want to trace the

[noise]\nI'm On the Democrat Party elite sad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken\nBy the left wing radicals and\nThat's why some are scratching their heads anyway from two thousand one to two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent\nThat here we go now this is a long piece but this next grabbed his money graph\nReady well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this stay simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute\nInto thousands of Lebanon white working class was totally go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party I mean the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high\nFor Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates if they had been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n\nPlacing a much stronger emphasis them African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party Owens white suburban women right we did so who is who is white women\nMaking up the majority of Democrat liberalism\nWho are very back of the many shrimp boat show me [laughter] you know I'd be met for use radio one thousand\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight [noise]\nKevin McCarthy ... for so long\nFully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands gigs love the ... river\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump's new\nThat's conservative God was like\nSo health President Trump's visit time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is built the wall and enforce the law\nPay for my safety for the express [noise]\nOh you saw\nNews radio one thousand deal\nAll right now look it's it takes a lot to get something passed me here we have McCaskill area filled reticent in Tennessee and we got to do ... and we've got this guy tester in Montana and they're all trying to tell us\nThat they're not wild liberal after their centrist and all this except we find out that's not really true or not\nBut here goes Thomas Bee Saul saying don't believe that this was after the after the Democratic party is real and it's solid so Thomas Bee and Saul is giving\nHis own Democrats have been a problem he's calling them out [noise]\nAnd I said just the thought of my son's going up without me inspired me to quit smoking\nI talked to my daughters and then I threw away all my cigarettes ashtrays and lighter I started exercising smoking\nGetting some fans on line Kat neon Dana way from alcohol when I was first quitting whiskey instead of ...

I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand ill legal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for this somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using facilities somebody\nHas to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power to vehicles that are being used here I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say of the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop [noise]\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be\nThat there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on a track there's gotta be somebody gets sick there has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe and\nLike Asian of sexual abuse and maybe start and by Trump law enforcement personnel\n[noise] I wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos into this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this like they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting head back to the phones got time to work so I'm In here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nThe afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do that in just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kim was always told me to call you I should call your call you finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up from South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them since they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been law reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called not a new disease is a disease out this has an outfit called ... and it's a polio like its disabling and also killing American\nChildren back twenty four twenty sixteen I was out free ... let me say that the CDC right as of now has not said they're not sure where it came from yeah\nTwenty fourteen twenty six team we had a similar outbreak yeah\nAnd I'm I live in a tough time finding the leaks out of the Internet 'cause it's just if you can be scrubbed but on January fourth to twenty six key on a website called natural news the headline read tarot virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's Choice\nRight right right now\nThe CDC is not coming out and people aren't coming out because it leads to much created to Trump's offer a wall if somebody was actually tell you the truth and the drive by needed don't shoot snakes that this would have some effect on those miles with small children for\nA\nYeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's it's amazing how these things remain isolated\nWe are here in the midst of an invasion of\nPeople from various backgrounds from various countries in Central America and South America\nAnd just independent leaves some days separation of park there's a story\nOf a shockingly unforeseen increase any polio cases I mean the state and the stories feature medical professionals who are stumped they can't figure out why this was happening\nThey they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of missed\nA couple of days go by and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I say there's no question common sense tells you there's a relationship here\nBut you're you're absolutely right there cannot be any official ... if you have the CDC or anybody else\nI turned to win severe weather strikes news radio ...
